Only those parents that receive Child Care Benefit (CCB) for approved child care and work, train or study at some time during the week are eligible for the Child Care Tax Rebate.Approved child care is care provided by a child care service that is approved under the family assistance legislation. Approved care services must meet Australian Government standards in relation to opening hours and a range of quality assurance measures. The linking of CCB funding to satisfactory participation in the quality assurance systems provides the Australian Government, and families, with a level of accountability that services are committed to providing quality outcomes for children.Approved child care services can include centre - based long day care services, family day care services, in-home care services, some occasional care services, and outside school hours care services. As approved services are primarily designed to assist families participate in the workforce and the community, they must be available to families for a minimum of eight hours a day, on each normal working day for at least 48 weeks a year.Preschools provide early childhood education for a limited age group and are not designed to cater for the needs of working families and as such are open for fewer hours per day than child care centres. Preschools also have scheduled breaks during the year aligned with school terms. Some preschools have met the requirements to become an approved child care service, which allows eligible families using those services to receive the CCTR.The funding of preschools is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. There is nothing to prevent state and territory governments from providing assistance to parents with children attending preschools. I note that the New South Wales Government under funds its preschool system by an estimated $90 million per year.</DOC>

The Border Protection Command (BPC) - formerly the Joint Offshore Protection Command was established on 30 March 2005.BPC brings together the resources and expertise of both the Australian Customs Service (Customs) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to create a single maritime surveillance and response system.BPC is comprised of two organisational units: the Coastwatch Division of Customs and Defence's Northern Command, under the command of a serving Rear Admiral. BPC reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Australian Customs Service and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). In turn the CEO and CDF report to the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Defence who have joint responsibility for the BPC.Officers are subject to the human resource policies and conditions of service of their parent agency.BPC is staffed by 207 personnel drawn from Customs and the ADF. Many of the Northern Command staff have additional responsibilities, such as those that fall within Defence Aid to the Community commitments. There are four SES equivalent positions within BPC.All positions that fall within BPC remain either Customs or ADF positions.Forward Estimates for BPC responsibilities are contained in Output 4 of the Australian Customs Service Portfolio Budget Statements and Outcome 1 of the Department of Defence Portfolio Budget Statements.As described in (2) above, BPC reports to both the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Defence. Each Minister retains operational responsibility for the personnel drawn from his agency.See my response to part (2).In accordance with decisions taken within the 2006-07 Budget process, staff representing the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Customs Enforcement Operations Coordination Unit are now co-located in BPC headquarters in Canberra. Additionally, the Customs National Marine Unit has outposted a Liaison Officer to Northern Command.The Command operates under a Directive signed by the CEO of Customs and the Chief of the Defence Force. The success of its operation will be assessed against this directive and the performance measures of its constituent units.</DOC>

I announced the Terms of Reference for the uranium mining, processing and nuclear energy review on 6 June 2006. The review will contribute to a wide ranging public debate on Australia's future energy needs and the broad range of emerging energy technologies.The review will consider the following matters:
Economic issues
The capacity for Australia to increase uranium mining and exports in response to growing global demand.The potential for establishing other steps in the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia, such as fuel enrichment, fabrication and reprocessing, along with the costs and benefits associated with each step.The extent and circumstances in which nuclear energy could in the longer term be economically competitive in Australia with other existing electricity generation technologies, including any implications this would have for the national electricity market.The current state of nuclear energy research and development in Australia and the capacity for Australia to make a significantly greater contribution to international nuclear science.
Environment issues
(a) The extent to which nuclear energy will make a contribution to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.(b) The extent to which nuclear energy could contribute to the mix of emerging energy technologies in Australia.
Health, safety and proliferation issues
The potential of 'next generation' nuclear energy technologies to meet safety, waste and proliferation concerns.The waste processing and storage issues associated with nuclear energy and current world's best practice.The security implications relating to nuclear energy.The health and safety implications relating to nuclear energy.The terms of reference therefore will provide for an informed and thorough examination of the issues surrounding nuclear energy. The Taskforce is chaired by Dr Ziggy Switkowski, and includes members highly qualified for the task.The Taskforce will produce a draft report for public consultation in November 2006. A final report will be completed by the end of 2006.When announcing the Taskforce, I said that the Commonwealth itself would not be constructing nuclear power stations.</DOC>

Under s.92(1) of the Airports Act, the public consultation process requires an airport to advertise its proposal in a newspaper circulating generally, make copies of its proposal available for public inspection and purchase, and invite written comments.The public consultation process is for 90 days. This concluded on 30 January 2006.In addition to their opportunity to comment as part of the public consultation process, and in addition to its normal consultation with officers from the neighbouring councils (Botany Bay, Rockdale and Marrickville), SACL has met with the Mayors of Sydney, Ashfield, Hurstville, Leichhardt, Randwick, Rockdale and Waverley to discuss its plans. SACL also provided a presentation to the Marrickville Council Mayor and several councils during the consultation period. The Councils of Ashfield, Botany, Marrickville, Randwick, Rockdale, Sutherland and the City of Sydney all provided written submissions during the consultation period, as did the Local Government Association of NSW and the Southern Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils.I am advised that SACL met with the NSW Government Planning Minister on 21 June 2006 and the NSW Roads Minister on 23 June 2006. The NSW Department of Planning provided a written submission on behalf of the NSW Government.See (a) above. Further to advertising and making it plans publicly available, SACL gave presentations to local councils and also received 13 submissions from members of the public during the consultation period.The draft MDP is currently under assessment by my Department. I will not prejudge what conditions might be placed on SACL if the draft MDP is approved.There have been no confirmed breaches of the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 (the Act) this year.See answer to question 5 above.</DOC>

to (d) The estimates in the 2006-07 Budget were based on an assumed full sale of Telstra in 2006-07. Accordingly, the Budget estimates assumed that the Government would receive only Telstra dividends paid in the first half of 2006-07 and that no Telstra dividends would be received by the Government in 2007-08, 2008-09 or 2009 - 10. The Government announced on 25 August 2006 that a Telstra share offer would proceed and that the Government would transfer the balance of its remaining shares to the Future Fund. The estimates have been updated as part of the 2006-07 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook update to reflect this announcement.The 2006-07 Finance and Administration Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS), on page 254, refers to a figure of $26,474,365,000 in relation to the Future Fund Management Agency, rather than $26,474,365. The $18 billion in seed capital was transferred to the Future Fund during the 2005-06 financial year (on 5 May 2006). The $26,474,365,000 shown in the 2006-07 PBS for the Future Fund Management Agency was the then estimate of further credits to the Future Fund Management Agency Special Account during the 2006-07 financial year, not the balance of the Fund as at 30 June 2007. This amount includes Telstra sale proceeds assumed to be paid into the Future Fund, and estimated interest and dividend earnings of the Fund.Following the Telstra 3 Share Offer, the Government will transfer around 2.1 billion shares that were not required in support of the Offer to the Future Fund. In addition, the proceeds from the first instalment payment in the Offer, over $8 billion, will be transferred to the Fund in January 2007. Proceeds from the final instalment will be transferred following receipt in 2007-08.Separately to the Telstra 3 Share Offer, on 29 September 2006, the Government announced that it will transfer $13.638 billion to the Future Fund during 2006-07.</DOC>

The new Purchasing Allowance Scheme replaces the existing Merit Point System and will be administered within the current contract arrangements.The Government allocated additional funds in the May 2006 Budget for changes to the Detention Services Contract, in respect of cleaning and catering services, following an independent review by Mr Michael Roche. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is currently negotiating these contract changes with GSL. It is not expected that changes to detainee activities associated with the Purchasing Allowance Scheme will require additional changes to the contract.</DOC>

No. The Australian Government did not agree to review Commonwealth legislation, policy and eligibility criteria that currently prevent grandparents who care for their grandchildren from accessing services and income support.At the Community and Disability Services Ministerial Council meeting of 26 July 2006, the Australian Government agreed that jurisdictions work together to develop a mechanism to allow grandparents, caring predominantly for their grandchildren without formal authority, to be eligible for appropriate Australian Government and State and Territory Government payments and services. At the states' and territories' insistence, this excludes foster care payments. This is at a preliminary stage and details have not yet been discussed.However, the Minister also noted that the states' and territories' requirement to exclude grandparents from accessing foster care payments may make finding a suitable mechanism difficult.The Australian Government values the important role of grandparents who have primary caring responsibility for their grandchildren.To support these grandparents, the Australian Government has implemented a number of specific measures, which include:waiving the Child Care Benefit work/study/training test for grandparent carersproviding access to a special rate of Child Care Benefit called Grandparent Child Care Benefitfunding the Transition to Independent Living Allowance for a further four years and expanding the eligibility criteria to assist young people in grandparent/relative carethrough Centrelink, implementing a service strategy and launching a booklet to increase customer, community and staff awareness of issues facing grandparent/relative families, andimplementing a new approach to the family law system which, amongst other things, reinforces the important role of grandparents.</DOC>

Benzene is not used in the manufacture of soft drinks.  However benzene has been found to form at very low levels in some beverages due to a reaction between common components of these beverages (that is ascorbic acid [also called vitamin C] and sodium benzoate which is used as a preservative).  Both of these additives are approved food additives for soft drinks, though ascorbic acid also occurs naturally in fruit and fruit juices.Food Standards Australia New Zealand sampled a range of flavoured beverages and had them analysed for benzene.  More than 90% of these products had benzene levels below the World Health Organisation guidelines for drinking water.  There is no World Health Organisation guideline for benzene content beverages or soft drinks. Food Standards Australia New Zealand performed an assessment and established that exposure to benzene from beverages represents a minor contribution compared to total benzene exposure from other routes.  The major sources of benzene exposure are from air inhalation, such as from traffic pollution, from filling up cars with petrol as petrol contains benzene, and both active and passive smoking.  According to the World Health Organisation benzene limit, people would need to drink more than 20 litres of a drink containing benzene each day to equal the amount of benzene inhaled from city air.In response to the survey results, Food Standards Australia New Zealand has liaised with other government departments and the food industry to ensure that levels of benzene in beverages are kept as low as can be achieved, while still ensuring the microbiological safety of these products.Manufacturers with products where benzene was detected have been advised of the results and referred to a guidance document to assist them in minimising the possible unintended formation of benzene.The Food Standards Australia New Zealand survey results do not raise any public health concerns in relation to benzene levels in flavoured beverages, as the trace amounts found make a negligible impact on overall benzene exposure.</DOC>

The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires all free-to-air broadcasters, including the ABC, to provide equivalent digital coverage to their existing analogue services as soon as practicable, and at the latest, by the end of the simulcast period when analogue broadcasts will cease.In March 2006 the ABC's main Northern Tasmania Local Radio service was moved from 711AM to 91.7FM.The ABC has advised that there are a number of benefits in converting from AM to FM transmissions. Transmissions on the FM band are better protected from electrical interference, provide consistent reception coverage both during the day and in the evening and have cleaner, clearer audio quality than comparable AM transmissions.In northern Tasmania, all other ABC Radio services transmit from the high-powered FM tower at Mt Barrow (Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, Classic FM and Triple J). This site provides more modern facilities than provided at the previous AM transmission site, to ensure continuity of transmissions. This includes the provision of a dedicated standby transmitter for the 91.7FM Local Radio service in circumstances when the main transmitter fails, which was previously not available.There are also 15 dedicated local 'infill' services that broadcast ABC Northern Tasmania Local Radio, supplementing the main regional service from Mount Barrow. These services have been established in the last twenty years to compensate for 711AM reception problems.</DOC>

These discussions on the impact on aviation operations also included discussions with VicRoads and the Tullamarine Interchange Alliance.The development required the Airport Building Controller to issue a series of works permits. In addition, as licence issued by EAPL to provide for access to the airport site was to a state government authority (VicRoads), the Department of Transport and Regional Services was required to approve this licence.</DOC>

The report has been brought to my attention.As is the case in many mainstream communities in Australia, junk food is often competitively priced compared with healthier and more nutritious alternatives.Sr Joan Healy has undertaken a visit to the APY Lands in 2006.As part of the Australian Government's approach to Indigenous Affairs, substantial work is being undertaken to promote healthy eating and nutritional programs to Indigenous communities.It is not within the purview of the Commonwealth Government to regulate this type of commerce. Stores on the APY Lands are encouraged to operate under the Mai Wiru Policy which encourages provision of cheap, nourishing food. This policy is built on the Healthy Stores Policy and is one component of the COAG Trial in the APY Lands being led by the Department of Health and Ageing.</DOC>

At times, the entitlement has been variously known as the Postage Allowance, the Information Delivery Services Allowance, and the Communications Allowance.As at 1 March 1996, a Senator or Member was entitled to the cost of postage in relation to parliamentary or electorate business, but excluding party business, not exceeding in total an annual amount of $22,000. Any part of the postage entitlement _ not utilised in one financial year [could] _ not be carried over to the next financial year.Changes to the postage entitlement since 1 March 1996 are as follows:From 1 July 1998, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1998/16:renamed the Postage entitlement, as the Information Delivery Services entitlement;enabled Senators and Members to use courier and other delivery services to distribute letters, newsletters, parcels and other communications;allowed unused entitlements to be carried over to the next financial year, up to a maximum carryover of $22,000;provided for unutilised entitlements to be returned to the Commonwealth on the last day of business before a polling day for a general or double dissolution election; andprovided that where a Senator or Member was re-elected, they were entitled to the unspent part of their entitlement for that financial year.On 21 December 1998, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1998/26:allowed a re-elected Senator or Member, in the 1998/1999 financial year only, to call forward an advance of up to 25 per cent of their 1999/2000 financial year Information Delivery Services entitlement; andwhere such an advance was made, provided that the next financial year's entitlement was reduced by the amount called forward.On 4 May 2000, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2000/02 increased the amount of the Information Delivery Services entitlement from $22,000 to $25,000 per annum.From 1 October 2000, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2000/11:renamed the Information Delivery Services entitlement, as the Communications Allowance;clarified that Communications Allowance could be used to meet the costs of electronic services, including establishing and maintaining websites;introduced a new category of Communications Allowance for members with electorates over 50,000km2 and set the rate for this category at $28,000 a year;clarified that the amount that could be carried over to a following year was the annual entitlement i.e. $25,000 or $28,000 as the case may be;allowed a Member representing an electorate of 300,000km2 or more to aggregate their Charter and Communications entitlements.On 26 September 2001, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2001/20:simplified the administrative requirements for reclaiming Communications Allowance funds on the last business day before polling for a general election or double dissolution; andallowed Members to use their Communications Allowance to communicate with electors who were not currently their constituents but who would be after an electoral redistribution. This entitlement was available from the date the Australian Electoral Commission determined the new boundaries.On 17 December 2001, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2001/27:extended the provisions outlined in item (b)(i) above (which originally applied only to the 1998/1999 financial year), so that Senators and Members could call-forward up to 25 per cent of their Communications Allowance from the next financial year, in any year when a general election is held; andas per the previous provisions, when a call-forward occurs, the Communications Allowance available in the following year is reduced accordingly.On 1 July 2003, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2003/14 increased the annual entitlement by 10 per cent to $27,500 for Senators and Members with electorates of less than 50,000km2; and $30,800 for Members with electorates of 50,000km2 or more.From 1 July 2005, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2005/09 provided:Members are entitled to a maximum annual allowance calculated by multiplying the number of voters enrolled in the member's electorate on the last working day in March each year by fifty cents.

The data line shall be installed and maintained at Commonwealth expense.Motor Vehicle LeaseLeased motor vehicle entitlements are provided to Senators and Members by the Remuneration Tribunal under Clause 5 of its determinations on Members of Parliament  -  Entitlements (currently Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2005/09). The entitlement is formally named the Private-Plated Vehicle entitlement.As at 1 March 1996, Clause 5 of Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1995/22 provided Senators and Members an entitlement to:5.1 _an Australian made, Commonwealth owned, private plated vehicle for use on parliamentary, electorate and private business.5.2 This entitlement shall not extend to vehicles other than those standard vehicles available through the panel period contracts of DAS Fleet, as advised by the Minister for Administrative Services.5.3 All running costs and maintenance costs shall be met by the Commonwealth.5.4 When used for private purposes the vehicle is to be driven only by the senator or member, or a person nominated by the senator or member.5.5 When used for travel to which the senator or member (or eligible family member/nominee) is otherwise entitled by the provisions of this determination _ the other entitlements are voided. Likewise, no private vehicle allowance is payable _ for travel by private plated Commonwealth vehicle.5.6 A senator or member who in accordance with the provisions of 5.1 requests and is provided with a vehicle shall contribute to the costs of provision of that vehicle at the same rate and in accordance with the same conditions as apply to members of the Senior Executive Service.5.7 Additionally to clauses 5.1 to 5.6, a member for the electorates of Maranoa, Grey, Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, Kennedy and Riverina-Darling shall, at the request of the member, be provided with a Commonwealth owned, private plated, four wheel drive motor vehicle.5.8 All running and maintenance costs [of the vehicle provided under 5.7] shall be met by the Commonwealth.5.9 The charter allowance entitlement _ of a member who requests to be provided with a four wheel drive vehicle as provided in clauses 5.7 and 5.8 shall be reduced by $8,320 pa.Changes to the Private-Plated Vehicle entitlement since 1 March 1996 have been:On 31 December 1996, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1996/19 allowed Senators and Members travelling from their home part of the way to Canberra on parliamentary business to park their private-plated vehicle at a connecting airport at Government expense, provided 'due economy' was served by doing so.On 2 January 1998, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1998/01 provided that:the Special Minister of State has the discretion to choose which vehicles are made available as standard vehicles, removing the restriction that they only be those available through the panel period contracts of Dasfleet;the Special Minister of State could approve the provision of a non - standard vehicle to a Senator or Member;the Special Minister of State could develop guidelines about the provision of non-standard vehicles to Senators and Members;any additional leasing costs for a non-standard vehicle (over the lease costs of a standard vehicle) were to be met by the Senator or Member by a deduction from their Charter or Electorate Allowance; andthe cost of the additional four - wheel drive vehicle provided to Senators for the Northern Territory and the Members for Maranoa, Grey, Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, Kennedy and Parkes, which was to be met under their Charter Allowance, was the lease cost _ as determined from time to time by the Special Minister of State, removing the reference to a fixed cost of $8,320.On 31 March 1998, the Special Minister of State issued Guidelines on the Provision of Non-Standard Private-Plated Vehicles. The Guidelines identified operational need and occupational health and safety as justifications for issue of a non-standard vehicle.On 21 December 1998, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 1998/26 specified that private-plated vehicles provided to Senators and Members could be used for parliamentary, electorate, official or private business, but not for commercial purposes.On 29 September 2000, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2000/11 provided that Members representing electorates of 300,000 or more square kilometres were entitled to a four - wheel drive vehicle in lieu of the entitlement to an Australian made, private-plated standard vehicle. Where a Member requests a four-wheel drive vehicle in accordance with this entitlement, the Commonwealth will meet the difference between the lease cost of an Australian made, private-plated standard vehicle and a four-wheel drive vehicle.On 9 April 2002, the Special Minister of State issued new Guidelines on Provision of Non-Standard Vehicles for Senators and Members 2002. The guidelines provided that vehicles would be considered for approval on the basis of:operational need;occupational health and safety reasons;preference for a smaller vehicle; orenvironmental considerations, such as fuel efficiency, alternative fuel sources, or emission reduction.On 17 June 2003, Remuneration Tribunal Determination changed the basis for calculating the personal cost contribution Senators and Members may choose to make, if they wish to use the vehicle for private purposes. Reference to the Public Service SES Executive Vehicle Scheme rates was removed and the Special Minister of State was provided the discretion to set the personal cost contribution rates.On 23 December 2003, the Special Minister of State approved the inclusion of specified all-wheel drive vehicles on the list of standard vehicles.On 28 January 2004, the Special Minister of State issued new Guidelines on Provision of Private-Plated Vehicles for Senators and Members 2004 and Guidelines on Provision of Non-Standard Vehicles for Senators and Members 2004. The guidelines:set the personal contribution for 4 cylinder vehicles and 6 cylinder vehicles as $711 per annum; andintroduced a specific reference to vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 2000cc in the Guidelines on Provision of Non-Standard Vehicles for Senators and Members 2004.On 20 March 2006, Remuneration Tribunal Determination 2006/02 provided that a Senator or Member is entitled to an additional $19,500 per annum of Electorate Allowance to meet the costs of transport within and for the service of the electorate, where he or she has chosen not to be provided with a private-plated vehicle.Electoral Staff TravelThe entitlement that provides for electorate staff to travel is made by a determination under Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 (MOP(S) Act). The first determination made in October 1984 stated that:Each Senator or Member has an entitlement for travel by Electorate Officers of a total of 15 visits by their staff from the electorate office to Canberra (or from Canberra to the electorate office) up to 100 days per annum. Any of those 15 visits are available for intra-State or intra-electorate travel by Electorate Officers.As at 1 March 1996, the Senators and Members Entitlements handbook stated that electorate staff may travel to provide support to Senators and Members. Such travel undertaken by staff could be within the electorate, between the electorate and capital city, and between the electorate and Canberra. An annual budget was allocated to cover travel costs for travel undertaken by staff at the direction of their Senator or Member. The balance of the travel budget at the end of a financial year cannot be carried over to the following financial year. The Electorate Staff Travel Budget varied between States and electorates because it reflects the cost of airfares between different parts of Australian and Canberra. Senators and Members were advised of their staff travel budgets at the start of each financial year.Changes to the Electoral Staff Travel entitlement since 1 March 1996 are as follows:On 30 August 2004, Determination 2004-05/4 under the MOP(S) Act was signed by the Special Minister of State which continued the entitlement in its existing form, but provided a single, contemporary statement of staff travel entitlements. The determination provided that:The Electorate Staff Travel Budget is calculated at the commencement of each financial year on the basis of:18 return economy airfares between the electorate and Canberra;100 days' Travelling Allowance at the rate applicable to Canberra;taxi fares and/or Motor Vehicle Allowance to and from the relevant airports for the 18 flights above; anda component for intra-electorate travel as follows:Senator/MemberElectorate Size$Member0-199 km2

$500Member1,000-9,999 km2

$5,000Member200,000-499,999 km2
$7,000Member500,000 km2 or greater$9,000SenatorAll$500
 
The Electorate Staff Travel Budget will be calculated pro rata, on the basis of the number of calendar days remaining, for the financial year in which a Senator or Member commences his or her term or where the Electorate staff of a Senator or Members commences his or her term or where the Electorate staff of a Senator or Member become subject to the Electorate Staff Travel Budget during a financial year.The Special Minister of State may approve changes to the Electorate Staff Travel Budget for any Senator or Member.
 
Office accommodation in the electorate, together with equipment and other facilities (including for personal staff) necessary to operate the office, as approved by the Minister, for purposes related to Parliamentary, electorate or official business, but not commercial business.The entitlement for Members with geographically large electorates to be provided with additional staff is approved by Ministerial Determination under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984.As at 1 March 1996, Members with electorates of 200,000km2, or over, in size were entitled to a second electorate office at official expense and an additional full-time Electorate Officer position located in that office. The entitlement applied to the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Northern Territory, Grey, Maranoa, Kennedy and Parkes.The Member for Leichardt was also provided with a second electorate office at official expense on Thursday Island, and an additional staff member, to service the needs of constituents on the Gulf of Carpentaria islands.The Member for O'Connor was also provided with a second electorate office at official expense and an additional staff member.Changes to the electorate office and staff entitlements for Members with large electorates since 1 March 1996 have been:On 10 December 1997, an electoral redistribution in Queensland increased the size of the electorate of Capricornia (with effect from the date of the next federal election). As a result, the entitlement to a second electorate office applied to the electorate of Capricornia from 3 October 1998.In 1999, the ten (10) largest electorates were provided an entitlement to an additional $10,000 budget to employ relief staff. This entitlement applied to the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Northern Territory, Grey, Maranoa, Kennedy, Parkes, Capricornia, O'Connor, Leichardt and Gwydir.On 23 March 2002, the Special Minister of State set the size of the electorate of O'Connor as the benchmark for a second electorate office, being 179,047 square kilometres or over. As a result, the entitlement also applied to the electorate of Gwydir.From 1 October 2002, the additional budget to employ relief staff, provided to the Members with the largest electorates, was increased from $10,000 to $15,000 per annum.On 25 November 2003, an electoral redistribution in Queensland reduced the size of the electorate of Capricornia (with effect from the date of the next federal election). As a result, the Member was not eligible for a second electorate office from 9 October 2004.On 10 July 2006, the Special Minister of State approved an entitlement to a second electorate office at official expense, and an additional full-time Electorate Officer position located in that office, for Members representing electoral divisions larger than 30,000km2.

The Department of Veterans' Affairs has never transferred responsibility for researching claims to any private firm. Therefore, the question of Mr John Tilbrook's involvement does not arise. However, a number of private researchers undertake supplementary investigations on behalf of the Department in cases where there is not enough evidence to support contentions put forward in a claim. The resulting reports form just one part of the evidence available to the determining officer.The Department was aware of Mr Tilbrook's links with the Army History Unit. In fact the skills, knowledge and experience that Mr Tilbrook had developed in his role in the Army History Unit commended him to the Department as one of a number of researchers who were engaged.The Department's initial engagement of Writeway Research was not a result of a formal tender process. However, the Department complied with the then-current Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and met the 'optimum value for money' requirement.The number of researchers providing military-research services has reduced over time, with Writeway currently one of three providers engaged by the Department from time to time on a panel basis.The Department is currently finalising specifications of a Request for Tender (RFT) for the provision of research services. The Department anticipates new contract arrangements being in place by 1 May 2007.Researchers have access to records held by the Department of Defence, National Archives, War Memorial, official histories and witnesses, and they are required to hold the clearances that are necessary to access these sources. The researcher prepares a report on how they conducted their investigation and their findings. Where the researcher has not been able to find anything which supports the claimant's contention, the research report is made available to the claimant or their representative. They have the right of reply and another opportunity to provide additional or clarifying information to the determining officer who may then request a supplementary research report. The research report forms just part of the evidence available to the determining officer. It is then the responsibility of the determining officer (or determining authority such as Veterans' Review Board or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) to consider all of the evidence available to them before making their decision using the relevant standard of proof.None. The Department is currently finalising specifications of a RFT for the provision of research services. A new panel arrangement is planned to be in place by 1 May 2007.Research reports only form one part of the claim assessment process, and my Department uses research reports in fewer than one percent of all cases. Before a claim can be refused due to material in a researcher's report, a copy of the report is provided to the claimant so that he or she has the opportunity to examine the researcher's findings. A final decision is not made until the claimant has had an opportunity to comment on all reports made by the researcher. If unsatisfied with a decision, a veteran has avenues of appeal through the Veterans' Review Board, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Courts.A Departmental Instruction (No: C11/2005) provides guidance to claims assessors. The instruction stipulates that research reports '_should be factual and non-judgmental_' Further, it requires that reports '_ must not contain or imply any opinions of the researcher on the veteran, the truthfulness of the veteran, the value of his or her service, the reasons for his or her actions or the reasons for making the claim.' This is entirely consistent with the requirements of Sections 32 and 137 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act (1986).</DOC>

Research reports are limited to addressing specific service-related questions which are asked by the Department. Research reports are only one piece of evidence used in determining claims. In all cases where a claim is refused due to material in a researcher's report, a copy of the report is provided to the claimant and their representative, and the claimant is given an opportunity to comment on the report. Any response from the claimant is considered along with all the other information that is available to the decision maker.No. Specific instructions relating solely to Vietnam Veterans or veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder have not been issued to Writeway Research. Research reports are limited to addressing specific service-related questions, and researchers are not provided with information about the nature or purpose of the claim, the diagnosis or condition being investigated or any medical or claims history.Requirements for conducting investigations are contained in the terms of the contracts that the Department holds with military researchers. From time to time, the Department issues instructions to Departmental officers and military researchers in relation to military research reports. In February 2005 the Department convened a meeting with researchers to discuss the Department's expectations in relation to military research investigations. New instructions were issued on 12 April 2005 to Departmental officers relating to the use of military researchers.</DOC>

I am aware of some media commentary opposing the sale of Medibank Private Limited.The Government has decided to sell Medibank Private Limited (MPL) through a share market float to ensure that the company remains a strong and independent player in the health insurance market, competing vigorously for customers and being subject to the full range of commercial disciplines. MPL's customers will be the beneficiaries of the greater efficiency that the private sector can bring to a government-owned company.Vibrant competition between health funds is the best way to put a lid on premium increases. A privatised Medibank can deliver lower management expenses and can look to expand into new business areas, lowering its average costs across the business. Floating the company will also give all Australians an opportunity to own part of MPL and will also allow existing members to be recognised by way of an entitlement in the public offer.Health insurance is a competitive market. The Government does not need to own one of Australia's 38 health funds.Selling MPL will also allow the Government to remove its conflict of interest in being the industry regulator and the owner of the largest participant in that industry, thereby allowing the Government to focus on its role as regulator.The Sale ties in with the Howard Government's broader strategy for making the Australian economy stronger and underpinning the prosperity of all Australians.</DOC>

The answer that was provided by DIMA and tabled on 18 January 2006 stating that the department has no record of engaging Eleven Group Consulting was incorrect. DIMA has now advised that it did engage Eleven Group Consulting to provide services to facilitate business planning.The incorrect answer that was tabled on 18 January 2006 was due to a mis-communication of the details of the service provider within DIMA. This in turn caused the search of DIMA's vendors to be incorrectly specified. DIMA has also advised that it has now instituted procedures to minimise the risks of this type of mistake reoccurring.</DOC>

Yes, the National Code of Practice for the Construction Industry has applied since its inception in 1998.Tenders are evaluated on the basis of value for money. This requires a comparative analysis of all relevant costs and benefits of each proposal throughout the whole procurement cycle. Cost is not the only determining factor in assessing value for money. In addition, tenderers who do not meet the Australian Government's mandatory tender requirements, including the National Code where relevant, are not eligible to be awarded tender contracts and therefore tendered prices are irrelevant.I am advised that of all of the tenders let since the Code's inception, there have been four projects which may fall within this category. The cost attributed to tender delays, although not necessarily as a result of the Code, are as follows:Australia Post Sydney Gateway Facility. $860,000.Australia Post Melbourne Gateway Facility. $2,131,000.Fit out of a new electorate office for the Hon Bob McMullan, MP. $5,790 in rent per month for the new office between December 2005 and May 2006.The Department of Defence reports that one project has been delayed. The cost of this delay is not anticipated to exceed $200,000.</DOC>

CSIRO is unable to provide this information. CSIRO's expenditure on garden maintenance is included with cleaning services and materials in expenditure transactions under CSIRO's General Ledger Account Record (AR) Codes. This, plus the fact that the organisation consists of more than 20 research divisions and other units located on over 50 sites across Australia, with the responsibility for gardening, cleaning and maintenance being handled locally, means that identifying and separating out the costs of gardening from other maintenance costs would need to be undertaken manually at these various sites. Such manual checks of all the records for the past six financial years would require a significant diversion of CSIRO's staff resources.CSIRO is unable to provide this information. CSIRO's expenditure on indoor plants is included with expenditure transactions on all Office Supplies, Printing and Stationery under CSIRO's General Ledger Account Record (AR) Code. In many CSIRO locations any expenditure on indoor plant hire will be authorised by a divisional group at a site (i.e. not even at the whole of site level). Manual checking records at this local level would be needed to capture and confirm the relevant items of expenditure. This would require a significant diversion of staff resources.

Most of the information sought has been provided in previous responses, from Minister Truss, to questions in writing 1104 and 3284, which were published in Hansard on 18 August 2005 and 9 August 2006 respectively. On that basis, I provide the following information for the 2005-06 financial year only, which was not provided in the earlier answers.The employment agencies engaged by the Department for the 2005-06 financial year were:Acumen ContractingAdecco Australia Pty LtdAffinity It RecruitmentAmbit Group Pty LtdCantlie Recruitment Services Pty LtdCareers Unlimited Pty LtdChandler MacLeodCompany Solutions (Aust) Pty LtdData#3 LtdDrake AustraliaEffective People Pty LtdFirstwater Pty LtdFrontier GroupHansen &amp; Searson Executive SearchHays Personnel Services (Aust) Pty LtdHudson Global Resources (Aust) Pty LtdJulia Ross Recruitment Pty LtdKelly Services (Australia) Pty LtdKowalski Recruitment Pty LtdLink RecruitmentManpower Services (Aust) Pty LtdPatriot Alliance Pty LtdPrime RecruitmentProfessional Careers Australia Pty LtdQuadrate SolutionsRecruitment Management Company Pty LtdRoss Logic Pty LtdSelect Australasia Pty LtdSkillsearch Contracting Pty LtdSOS RecruitmentSpherion Technology Solutions Pty LtdThe Green and Green Group Pty LtdThe Public Affairs RecruitmentVerossity Pty LtdWizard Information Services Pty LtdWizard Personnel &amp; Office Services Pty LtdThe total payments to employment agencies for 2005-06 financial year was $5,527,374.34.This figure is the total amount paid to employment agencies, which include the provision of recruitment services as part of their business line. The amounts paid to these agencies (as shown above) include payments for a range of services such as: salary related costs for provision of contract staff (for example to meet short-term shortages resulting from absence of the substantive occupant, during interim periods associated with the filling of ongoing vacancies, or where the Department is unable to find suitably skilled staff through normal recruitment processes), assistance with recruitment services, conduct of recruitment campaigns, scribing services and other related services.The Department has devolved the engagement of employees to line managers. While the Department utilises selection reports on individual recruitment exercises, these reports do not systematically identify whether the successful candidate was selected through a process involving the services of an employment agency. To prepare a detailed response to this question would therefore involve a significant diversion of resources, which I am not prepared to authorise.</DOC>

The Department has in place a panel arrangement of ten employment agencies to provide short term labour and a suite of recruitment services. Due to the decentralised function groups are able to access these services without involvement from Corporate. It would be an unreasonable diversion of resources to provide any further information.</DOC>

With regards to the delisting of calcium tablets from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) provided advice between 6-8 July 2005. The advice was tabled in Parliament on 31 October 2005, and is attached.Yes.For patients with chronic renal failure calcium tablets remain subsidised. For patients other than those with chronic renal failure, calcium supplements remain relatively inexpensive at doses used to treat osteoporosis and other conditions. They are widely available as over-the-counter products. Calcium tablets, such as Caltrate and Citracal, are available for around $13 to $15 for two months' supply of 120 tablets or $7 per month.Professor March's comments were noted.The Commonwealth Government takes great care with its decisions on drug listing and pricing and aims to keep medicines affordable for all Australians. It must also keep the PBS affordable into the future.Some medications rejected by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) have been referred to other programs, such as the Lifesaving Drugs Program and the Herceptin Program.As a result of the budget decision, calcium was removed from the PBS for most purposes. It remains listed for patients with renal failure. The PBS includes a wide variety of drugs for many conditions, including bone-strengthening products for certain patients with osteoporosis post-fracture, but it is not possible, and it is not intended, that the PBS cover every useful treatment. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - AttachmentCALCIUM TABLETS- Deletion from PBS - 2005-06 Budget Decision - Advice to the Minister - July 2005 PBAC meeting250 mg (as citrate), Citrocal®, Key Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd;500 mg (as carbonate), Cal-Sup®, 3M Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd; 600 mg (as carbonate), Caltrate®, Wyeth Consumer Healthcare.The PBAC noted the policy context of the Budget decision and Government's view that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) does not need to subsidise inexpensive over-the-counter medicines that are required in low doses to obtain health outcomes or where dietary modification could suffice to meet clinical needs. It also noted that the current restricted benefit listing allows for prescribing for hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure, hypocalcaemia, osteoporosis, or proven calcium malabsorption.The PBAC recalled that at the June 2005 Special Meeting it had identified the following patient groups where calcium supplementation is clinically necessary.-patients with hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure; patients with established osteoporosis and taking bisphosphonates; patients with bone metastases associated with, certain malignancies and taking bisphosphonates; and patients with multiple myeloma and taking bisphosphonates.With respect to use in chronic renal failure, the PBAC again acknowledged that particularly large doses of calcium were required in the treatment of this condition and therefore these patients would be particularly disadvantaged by the de-listing of calcium tablets.The PBAC recalled that the PBS listings for the anti-resorptive agents (including alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene and recently recommended strontium) for established osteoporosis with prior fracture, had been made on the basis that the combination was clinically appropriate, and, when used in combination with calcium, the cost-effectiveness ratio was acceptable. Similarly, the cost-effectiveness of the bisphosphonates in the treatment of bone metastases and multiple myeloma was acceptable on the basis of co-administration with calcium. The PBAC was concerned that these patient groups would not be optimally treated if they ceased taking calcium tablets should they become less affordable by de-listing.The PBAC considered an authority required listing for calcium for the patient groups identified above would ensure that calcium would not be subsidised for dietary supplementation.</DOC>

Yes.Yes.The delisting of calcium tablets from the PBS for certain patient groups is unlikely to result in these patients stopping use of calcium. These tablets are readily available over the counter and cost $13 to $15 on average for two months treatment.Calcium tablets remain available at community outlets. In addition, there are a number of medicines listed on the PBS for use in the treatment of osteoporosis with a related fracture. The PBS expenditure on these medicines in the financial year 2005-06 was in excess of $152 million.</DOC>

All workers' compensation schemes in Australia have limits on weekly income replacement payments. These range from time or dollar limits, to age limits. Schemes operate on the basis of paying compensation for the loss of ability to earn an income so, by extension, payments would cease at a retirement age that was in line with community expectations. However, as the traditional notion that all workers will retire by age 65 becomes less relevant, there is increasing pressure on schemes to change. There are movements to amend the arrangements of schemes to allow for coverage for workers injured near to, or after, reaching age 65. It should be noted that as most schemes provide continuing coverage for medical and related costs, it is only income replacement which ceases.The Workplace Relations Ministers' Council (WRMC) has looked at the issue of the impact of an ageing workforce on workers' compensation schemes in Australia. WRMC has specifically requested that the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) examine this issue and, in particular, examine any potential barriers which occupational health and safety or workers' compensation schemes present to labour force participation by mature age workers. The Office of the ASCC in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is conducting research on both topics and is due to report back to WRMC in 2007.</DOC>

Current policy requires people who wish to receive Rent Assistance as part of their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) to claim fortnightly FTB payments through the Family Assistance Office (FAO), rather than a lump sum payment through their tax return. This generally reflects the need for these families to receive Rent Assistance on a fortnightly basis, as well as the need for the FAO to administer rent verification procedures.The FTB tax claim instructions make it clear that Rent Assistance must be claimed directly from the Family Assistance Office (FAO), not through a tax return. An individual may initially receive a lump sum of Rent Assistance for a past period, through the FAO, as long as they claim fortnightly payments of Family Tax Benefit at the same time. This ensures people who may have been unaware that Rent Assistance is not available through their tax return are not disadvantaged when they first claim FTB.No amendment to policy is required as the current policy is still appropriate.</DOC>

The arrangement with Corporate Express Australia Ltd (Corporate Express) for the provision of office supplies, put in place by the former Department of Administrative Services in 1997, was for an initial term of four years with the option to extend the arrangements by a further one year.From 2003, after the expiry of the one year extension period, the arrangement with Corporate Express continued on a month to month basis as it was of comparatively low commercial risk, given the low value of individual transactions and the non-exclusivity of the arrangements.It is not usual departmental practice to extend contracts on a month-by-month basis.The following data is the expenditure that was incurred for departmental office supplies from Corporate Express from 1999-2000 onwards:Financial yearExpenditure(excluding GST)1999 - 2000$690,487.572000  -  2001$804,522.942001 - 2002$905,656.182002 - 2003$1,045,015.472003  -  2004$1,205,771.582004  -  2005$1,666,554.122005  -  2006           $1,685,098.142006  -  16 October 2006$426,257.59Table 1: Expenditure with Corporate Express on departmental stationery suppliesThe department's financial management information system was introduced in April 1999.

No. The Government is not intending to impose any additional requirements on health funds in relation to their communications with members about gap cover arrangements. The basis of gap cover arrangements is that doctors are free to choose to use health funds' gap cover arrangements on a patient by patient basis.Members are advised to check first if the doctor or hospital will use the gap cover arrangements in their case and what the cost for the procedure will be. The health fund will then be able to advise the member the level of benefit payable under the gap cover scheme.The Government is not intending to require health funds to advise members that a gap payment will be associated with a procedure. However, it is working with doctors and funds to increase the rate of 'informed financial consent' where patients are given information about the total cost of their procedure. As well, there will be information on how gap cover arrangements operate on the new website being developed by the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman.</DOC>

The MCEETYA National Statement and Plan for Languages Education in Australian Schools 2005-2008 does not include statements of support for specific programme types, such as bilingual programmes, for any language, including Indigenous languages.-       The Statement provides the current rationale for languages education, describes the purpose and nature of languages education and affirms the key role that it can play in the development of intercultural skills. It emphasises that all languages are equally valid in fulfilling this role.-       The Plan provides an overarching framework for state, territory and national governments to make decisions regarding six areas of common concern: Teaching and Learning, Teacher Supply and Retention, Professional Learning, Program Development, Quality Assurance and Advocacy and Promotion of Languages Learning.The National Statement and Plan does, however, include a distinct and explicit presence for Indigenous languages. The importance of Australian Indigenous languages to Indigenous people and the broader community is clearly acknowledged and valued in the Statement:Australian Indigenous Languages have a unique place in Australia's heritage and in its cultural and educational life. For Indigenous learners, they are fundamental to strengthening identity and self-esteem. For non-Indigenous learners, they provide a focus for development of cultural understanding and reconciliation. The choice of which Australian Indigenous Language should be offered requires careful negotiation with Indigenous people. It also requires recognition of protocols related to language ownership, language maintenance and revival; and acknowledgement of the cultural connections and contexts of languages within Australian Indigenous communities (page 7).In addition, an Indigenous perspective is included in the actions listed in the National Plan.The National Statement and Plan was not developed by the Australian Government. It was developed through the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) during 2003-2004, following a MCEETYA Review of Languages Education in Australian Schools in 2003. The Review proposed that stronger collaboration at the national level was needed to further enhance the quality of the language learning experience and to make it a reality for all learners.The National Statement and Plan was drafted using the comprehensive data and research that had been collected during the 2003 Review and informed by extensive consultations with key stakeholders.A working party, which included representation from all jurisdictions, the National Catholic Education Commission, the Independent Schools Council of Australia, and the Australian Council of Assessment and Curriculum Authorities progressed the development of the National Statement and Plan.Wide-ranging consultations were held including several meetings, a national roundtable, and drawing on expert advice from key stakeholders. The roundtable included representatives from State and Territory government and non-government education jurisdictions, academics, deans of education, other MCEETYA taskforces, principals associations, the Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages (FATSIL), and other experts in the field.The Department of Education, Science and Training does not directly fund any languages programmes in Australian schools. Through the School Languages Programme (SLP) the Australian Government is providing approximately $112 million from 2005-2008 to support languages education in general. The bulk (95 per cent) of funds is paid to government education authorities, Catholic Education Commissions and Associations of Independent Schools. Funds may be used to support Asian, European and Indigenous languages as well as Auslan, the sign language of the hearing impaired. Education authorities decide on the most strategic use of the funds to support languages education in their jurisdiction. States and territories also commit their own funds to support languages education.Education authorities are required to submit a Programme Activity Report by 31 January each year that provides information on programme activities for the preceding year, including the specific amount of programme funds that have been expended on Australian Indigenous languages.2005 was the first year this information was collected nationally. The reports received indicated that some 1.5 per cent of 2005 SLP funds nationally ($359,177) was expended on Indigenous languages education.From 2005 a national strategic projects element has been incorporated in the SLP to support the implementation of the MCEETYA National Statement and Plan. 5 per cent of SLP funds (approximately $1.3 million per annum) is being reserved for national projects.One of the projects currently being undertaken with 2005 SLP funds is an Investigation into the current provision of Indigenous language programmes in Australian schools.The key objectives of the project are to:obtain a comprehensive national picture of the current provision of Indigenous language programmes in Australian schools as well as teacher preparation, training and professional learning opportunities for teachers and speakers of Indigenous languages delivering or wishing to deliver such programmes;identify critical factors contributing to the delivery of good practice Indigenous language programmes being delivered in Australian schools in a range of settings across Australia;promote good practice Indigenous language programmes nationally (including the identification and promotion of at least 6 good practice examples of Indigenous language programmes operating in Australian schools); andmake key recommendations for action that can be undertaken in the next phase of the Project to improve sustainability and quality of Indigenous language programmes delivered in Australian schoolsThe project commenced in August 2006 and is being conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER), following a tender process. The total funding for the project is $220,000 (inc. GST). To date, $50,000 has been expended.A Project Advisory Group has been established to provide advice during the project. This group consists of representatives from a number of stakeholder groups and includes a representative of FATSIL.A literature review and a comprehensive mapping exercise has commenced as part of the project. The mapping exercise will determine current state and territory policies and practices relating to Indigenous languages in Australian schools, the number and types of Indigenous language programmes currently being delivered in schools in each state and territory, and how these are staffed and funded. A consultation process has been conducted in states and territories with key stakeholders and six schools have been nominated to participate in case studies of their Indigenous language programmes. The final report is due to be completed by 31 July 2007.No funding is provided to support the MCEETYA Languages Education Working Party. Jurisdictions support their representatives' involvement. The Working Party comprises representatives from each State and Territory, the Australian Government, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Schools Council of Australia.The specific role of the Languages Education Working Party is to:- develop an annual operational plan which prioritises actions from the Plan, according to the available budget- reach agreement on processes and structures for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the National Plan- provide advice to DEST on its projects of national significance, from those identified in the National Plan- seek additional funding for national projects from other sources.The Working Party also facilitates communication and consultation within individual jurisdictions and sectors and ensures that jurisdictional/sector perspectives and positions are taken into account, and ensures that consultation occurs with key stakeholders.</DOC>

Yes.Yes, the closure is permanent.A survey by Bankstown Airport Limited (BAL) of over 1,300 general aviation operators using the airport found that they used runway 18/36 for less than 1% of all activity. BAL undertook significant public consultation prior to the closure of runway 18/36 in July 2005. The runway closure was widely canvassed within the general aviation industry and the local community, notably in drafting its 2005 Master Plan, which required a 90-day public consultation period.The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised my Department that there is no mandatory requirement for an aerodrome operator to provide any number of runways so that 100 per cent wind utilisation is achieved. There are many aerodromes in Australia (and world wide) that only have one runway which means that in times of extreme cross wind conditions many aircraft are unable to use these runways. CASA notes that it is the professional responsibility of pilots to ensure they have planned their flight to ensure a safe landing, taking into account expected meteorological conditions, including wind shifts.</DOC>

The consultant is not a company but an individual contracted on a fee for service basis.In 2004-05, the cost of each of the two speeches prepared by the consultant was $450 and $330. In 2005-06, the cost of each of the three speeches prepared by the consultant was $540, $420, and $450.</DOC>

No.and (b) The requirement to replace the LCM-8 was identified before the Tank Replacement Program was initiated and, as such, did not include a specific requirement to lift the Abrams M1A1 tank. Regardless, the Landing Platform Amphibious Watercraft can technically lift a load of greater weight than the Abrams tank. The Army has initiated a program to validate this through engineering studies and trials. This process will be completed by June 2007. The long-term plan to procure amphibious ships under JP2048 does include the specific requirement to lift Abrams tanks and that capability will be brought into service with the Canberra - class Landing Helicopter Dock ships.</DOC>

None of the 13 international conventions on terrorism specifically cover incitement to suicide terrorism as a crime of universal jurisdiction. However, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes discrimination, hostility or violence to be prohibited by law.  Furthermore, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624 (adopted on 14 September 2005) calls upon all States to adopt such measures as may be necessary and appropriate and in accordance with their obligations under international law to prohibit by law incitement to commit a terrorist act or acts; prevent such conduct; and deny safe haven to any persons with respect to whom there is credible and relevant information giving serious reasons for considering that they have been guilty of such conduct.The United Nations is negotiating a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.  The draft convention includes provisions that prohibit Parties from assisting in any way the commission of terrorist offences in other countries.  This includes acquiescing in, encouraging or tolerating activities within their territories directed towards the commission of such offences.  In terms of jurisdiction, the convention requires Parties to establish their jurisdiction over terrorist offences if they are committed by or against their nationals, or if they are committed in their territory.A number of the international conventions on terrorist-related activities define terrorist acts.      It is expected that once the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism is finalised, it will similarly define such acts.As per response to (1) (a).The Australian Government condemns all forms of terrorism and is committed to fighting terrorism both in Australia and internationally.  We have developed comprehensive offences that capture a broad range of activities involved in the commission of a terrorist attack.  At the international level, multiple conventions already exist that target terrorism as a whole.  These conventions already capture suicide terrorism since, by definition, suicide terrorism is a subset of terrorism in general.  Given this strong existing legal framework, the Government does not see a need to develop a particular international convention on suicide terrorism.</DOC>

and (2) As the questions asked are very similar to those questions asked by Senator Sherry, at the Senate Economics Estimates hearing on 30 May 2006, I refer to the Commissioner of Taxation's response to question on notice BET 130.Illegal tobacco can be sourced through legally grown crops, smuggled imported leaf or from illegal production.There has recently been a major change in the tobacco industry in Australia. The major manufacturers have announced they will no longer be purchasing tobacco grown by growers in Victoria and South Queensland. As such a legal market for locally grown tobacco leaf no longer exists in Australia. This change is expected to significantly alter the profile of illicit tobacco activity into the future.As a result of the decision to cease purchasing Australian produced tobacco the Tax Office has commenced a process to cancel the licences of all current tobacco producers.</DOC>

The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) reviewed allegations about CMADSS reported to it in August 2005, regarding corporate governance issues and use of Australian Government funds, and found that there was no specific information indicating misuse of Australian Government funds. As a number of the allegations related to the organisation's operation as an incorporated association, these were referred to the NSW State Government for its consideration.The Department has reviewed CMADSS' annual audited financial statements and monthly statements of direct hours of service provided by CMADSS through its Community Aged Care Package service, and six monthly activity reports of its National Respite for Carers Program service.As part of the Australian Government's Quality Reporting Program, CMADSS was reviewed in December 2005. This involved CMADSS submitting a written report and the Department undertaking a desk audit. The Department subsequently visited CMADSS on 7-8 March 2006. CMADSS were informed of the Department's concerns about the systems and processes in place and an improvement plan was developed to address these concerns. Another site visit occurred on 15 June 2006.The Department maintains ongoing discussions with CMADSS with regard to its governance, its responsibilities as an approved provider of community care under the Aged Care Act 1997, and its contractual responsibilities as a provider of a National Respite for Carers Program service.The Department continues to monitor the operations of CMADSS on an ongoing basis with respect to its responsibilities as an approved provider of community care under the Aged Care Act 1997, and its contractual responsibilities as a provider of a National Respite for Carers Program service. This includes the standard monitoring of the organisation's Community Aged Care Package audited annual financial statements, and its six-monthly National Respite for Carers Program financial accountability reports.The Department assesses the operations of CMADSS on an ongoing basis with respect to its responsibilities as an approved provider of community care under the Aged Care Act 1997, and its contractual responsibilities as a provider of a National Respite for Carers Program service.Yes.

It has long been the practice of the Commissioner not to provide information about the affairs of individual taxpayers.By way of general comment it is advised that when goods are entered for home consumption in Australia, GST is collected by Customs. It is either paid at that point or an entry is recorded on the deferred GST system for reconciliation on the next BAS.</DOC>

Yes, I am aware of the 22 November 2006 article in Haaretz. My understanding is that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in fact met with the families of the captured soldiers during her visit to Israel, as announced during her 23 November 2006 press conference in Jerusalem.All parties to a conflict have responsibilities to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law.On the specific issue raised in (1), Australia utterly condemns taking hostages for political purposes and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the IDF soldiers, including Cpl Gilad Shalit, taken hostage near the Israel-Gaza border on 25 June, and also the two IDF soldiers taken hostage on 12 July by Hezbollah. The abduction of IDF soldiers will do nothing to advance the cause of the Palestinian people. We are deeply concerned at the complicity of Hamas' armed wing in the initial attack and at the subsequent action by Hezbollah on the Israel Lebanon Border.All states have a responsibility to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law in response to any conflict. Specific provisions of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols set out the relationship between states and international organisations including the United Nations.</DOC>

Yes.There is currently no formal selection process for a conventional round for the JSF's gun. Industry within a number of JSF partner countries, including Australia, is developing a conventional round suitable for the JSF's gun.Any prospective qualifying costs for a non-DU round for the JSF have not been determined. However, it is likely that any costs associated with qualifying a non-DU round would be shared among JSF partners benefiting from the use of a non-DU round.Yes.Development and certification of a non-DU round suitable for the JSF is considered to be a relatively low risk activity and is highly unlikely to affect the Government's JSF acquisition decision.</DOC>

Administration (TGA) for effectiveness as well as quality and safety prior to market entry. Xenical is a registered medicine and therefore the TGA has assessed it for quality, safety and efficacy.  Xenical is indicated for the treatment of obese patients with a body mass index (BMI)   30, and overweight patients with a BMI   27 in the presence of other risk factors, in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet.  Xenical is only permitted to be supplied by pharmacists.There are two listed medicines containing the name 'Fat Buster' on the ARTG.  Listed medicines (identifiable by an AUST L number on the label) are of relatively lower risk, as they may only contain ingredients that have been approved by the TGA as being of low risk and may only make certain therapeutic claims. The sponsors of such products are required to hold relevant evidence that is of the level and type appropriate for the product in accordance with the Guidelines for Levels and Kinds of Evidence to Support Indications and Claims For Non-Registerable Medicines, including Complementary Medicines, and other Listable Medicines.  However, the TGA does not evaluate this evidence prior to the product being included on the ARTG as a Listed (low-risk) medicine.Listed medicines may not generally refer to serious forms of disease, disorders or conditions, or indicate that they are for the treatment, cure, management or prevention of any disease, disorder or condition.  Weight loss products that are Listed on the ARTG are not permitted to make claims relating to obesity as obesity is considered a serious condition. Listed medicines may only make weight loss claims provided they clearly indicate that the product may only assist in losing weight when used in conjunction with dietary and exercise measures. The TGA conducted a search of the ARTG in response to the question.  With regard to registered medicines, there are three active ingredients used in Registered prescription-only medicines for the purposes of weight loss, with twenty-five associated register entries (corresponding to different brands, strengths, etc).  There is one active ingredient used in two (registered) over-the-counter medicines indicated for weight loss. With regard to Listed medicines, there are currently 229 listed medicines that make reference to 'weight loss', 'weight reduction' or 'overweight' or that use the claim 'May aid or assist weight loss by suppression of appetite in conjunction with (or as part of) a kilojoule/calorie controlled eating plan'.The TGA enforces the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the Act) and subordinate legislation.  This legislation relates to the regulation of medicines.  Although advertising and claims are regulated under the Act, terms such as 'misleading conduct' may relate to conduct that is also prohibited by the Trade Practices Act 1974.The TGA has taken action where sponsors of weight loss products have breached the Act, including cancelling products.  Where a sponsor makes an inappropriate claim (for example a listed medicine referring to obesity, or a claim outside those approved for the product), or a claim that cannot be substantiated, the TGA can take regulatory action.  However, the details of such actions are not publicly available.Additionally, the TGA has taken action where products have been advertised inappropriately.Under Australia's co-regulatory system of advertising, the Complaints Resolution Panel (CRP) considers complaints against advertisements in mainstream print and broadcast media and internet advertising for therapeutic goods.  The CRP publishes its determinations on the Complaints Register: &lt;http://www.tgacc.com.au&gt;.  Other complaints (including some against internet advertisements and point of sale or direct mail material) are handled by the TGA directly.Any advertisements for therapeutic goods are required to comply with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code (TGAC).  Recent amendments to the TGAC have strengthened the requirements for advertisements making claims for weight management, whereby these advertisements must now have a balance between the claims and references to healthy energy-controlled diets and physical activity.  Therefore, any weight management claim for such a medicine is dependent not only on the medicine's ingredients, but also critically dependent on diet and exercise. Clause 7(3) of the TGAC states that:'Advertisements for therapeutic goods containing claims for weight management, meaning weight loss, measurement reduction, clothing size loss and weight control/maintenance, must have an appropriate balance between the claims and references to healthy energy-controlled diet and physical activity.'</DOC>

The principle of the Child Support Scheme is that children of separated parents should benefit from the financial support of both their parents, according to their parents' capacity to support them. In most cases, a parent's taxable (gross) income is a reliable and accurate measure of a parent's capacity to provide financial support for their children. Using taxable income as the base places child support as the highest priority on a parent's income, equivalent to paying tax. The recent Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support considered this issue, as part of extensive research undertaken on the costs of children, and recommended the continued use of taxable income for these reasons. Additionally, using net income would result in higher child support percentages in order to maintain an appropriate level of child support. This would disadvantage paying parents earning lower incomes as they pay lower levels of tax, and would therefore pay a higher proportion of their after-tax income in child support.Most underpayments of child support are as a result of more accurate income information becoming available and being applied to the assessment. When an underpayment is due to a CSA error, CSA will endeavour to contact the parent to make appropriate arrangements for payment. CSA takes into account a parent's financial circumstances when entering into a payment arrangement. CSA is currently implementing the Building a Better CSA initiative, to improve customer service and reduce the occurrence of errors. As this is a service delivery issue, further questions should be directed to the Minister for Human Services, the Honourable Joe Hockey MP, who has responsibility for the service delivery of CSA.The Child Support Scheme was recently the subject of an extensive review by a Ministerial Taskforce. The Australian Government has accepted the Taskforce's recommendations to improve the Child Support Scheme. The recommendations are currently being implemented in three stages, with the majority of reforms to be introduced from 1 July 2008. This will include a new child support formula based on new Australian research on the costs of children. The primary objective of the Child Support Scheme remains to ensure that separated parents take responsibility for the support of their children. As such, only the income of the child's natural or adoptive parents is taken into account, not the income of any new partner that either parent may have.From 1 July 2008, income from second jobs and overtime that is earned by parents in the first three years after separation for the purpose of meeting re-establishment costs will be able to be excluded from the income that is used to calculate child support. This measure is part of Stage 3 of the Child Support Reforms from 1 July 2008 and will assist parents who need to re-establish themselves after relationship breakdown.</DOC>

No. As explained in my response to question number 4850, the Australian Government has funded Commonwealth legal aid services through two appropriations over the period in question. The figures referred to by the honourable member appear to relate to only a part of the total funding provided by the Government for these services  -  that allocated in Appropriation Act (No 2).No. As explained in my response to question number 4850, there has been no decline in total Commonwealth funding for legal aid over the period in question.To the contrary, payments for legal aid services through legal aid commissions increased by 16.01 per cent between 2003-04 and 2005-06.The reduction between 2003-04 and 2004-05 in the amount allocated in Appropriation Act (No 2) reflects the transfer of funding for legal aid services through the Legal Aid Commission of NSW to Appropriation Act (No 1). Payments for the provision of legal aid services through legal aid commissions are made directly to legal aid commissions in three jurisdictions under Appropriation Act (No 1) and to States and Territories for five other jurisdictions under Appropriation Act (No 2). Payments from both appropriations were: $128.02m in 2003-04; $144.67m in 2004-05; and $148.52m in 2005-06.As explained in my response to question number 4850, the Australian Government provides funds for other forms of legal assistance as follows:payments for the provision of legal aid to Indigenous Australianspayments to community legal servicespayments to Indigenous family violence prevention legal services; andpayments under various schemes of financial assistance.In 2003-04, funding for these payments and for legal aid services provided through legal aid commissions totalled $212.06m; in 2005-06, they totalled $236.08m  -  an increase of 11.33 per cent overall.</DOC>

As has been consistently stated throughout the consultation and legislative processes, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) role in assessing any proposed mergers involving media companies is the same as its role in assessing mergers in any other industry: to assess the competition impacts of proposals in relation to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974.However, the paper entitled Media Mergers, released in August 2006 by the ACCC, does in fact acknowledge that the ACCC's assessment of proposed media mergers is likely to incidentally assess issues relating to diversity. When read in full, the quotation provided by Mr Murphy in his question reads:'A key purpose of the Trade Practices Act is to protect competition in markets in Australia, including media markets. Media diversity is primarily protected by the restrictions on cross-media mergers in the Broadcasting Services Act.However, the ACCC will consider the impact of media mergers on market concentration, and therefore on the number and market share of media outlets in a market. The ACCC will also consider whether a merged media business could exercise market power by reducing the quality of the content it provides consumers, which could include reducing the diversity of the content it provides.'The media reform package, which will relax the cross media laws upon Proclamation contains a number of significant safeguards to ensure that the diversity of Australian media is protected. Chief among these protections is the 5/4 media diversity rule, which will ensure that no transaction (cross media or otherwise) will be permitted in a radio licence area unless a minimum number of media groups will remain after that transaction is completed. This number is five in mainland state capitals and four in regional licence areas. This diversity protection mechanism will be administered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.A second safeguard is the '2 out of 3 rule' which will ensure that no more than two of the three regulated media (that is, commercial radio, commercial television and associated newspapers) in any one radio licence area are able to be owned by the same media group.Further diversity protection is provided through the retention of control limits, which limit a person to controlling not more than one television licence and two radio licences in a single licence area, and forbid the control of television licences which are capable of reaching more than 75 per cent of the population.</DOC>

This is the same for those seeking aged care.The Department does not have data on 'dementia-specific bed' approvals.However, the Department does have data on the numbers of people who have been approved by an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) for residential aged care and/or community care packages but have not yet accessed the care approved.

There is unlikely to be a deterrent effect in having specific suicide terrorism offences or conventions. That is why existing terrorism offences focus on preparatory behaviour.Australia's domestic counter - terrorism legislation makes it an offence to engage in terrorist  acts or to plan, finance or otherwise assist in the commission of such acts, or to be a member of a terrorist organisation. The legislation has defined a terrorist act as one which:causes serious physical harm or death to a person; orendangers a person's life; orcreates a serious risk to public health or safety; orcauses serious damage to property; orseriously interferes with, disrupts or destroys an electronic system;with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the government of Australia or a foreign government, or intimidating the public.An act of suicide terrorism is still a terrorist attack; its only distinction is that it involves the suicide of the perpetrator.Australia's counter - terrorism laws have extra - territorial application.(2)   The following 13 conventions constitute the international legal framework for combating terrorism, including suicide terrorism:1. Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (Tokyo, 1963)2. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft (The Hague, 1970)3. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation (Montreal, 1971)4. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents (New York, 1973)5. International Convention against the Taking of Hostages (New York, 1979)6. Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (Vienna, 1980)7. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation (Montreal, 1988)8. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (Rome, 1988)9. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf (Rome, 1988)10. Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection (Montreal, 1991)11. International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings (New York, 1997)12. International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (New York, 1999)13. International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (New York, 2005)The UN's draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, once concluded, will serve to strengthen this framework.</DOC>

Australia seeks the lodgment of an annual taxation return under a self assessment regime. As a result, not all returns are individually checked for accuracy.The Tax Office recognises some taxpayers make mistakes when lodging their annual tax return. To assist taxpayers to lodge a correct return and to maintain the integrity of the self assessment regime, an integrated approach of help, education and enforcement is adopted. A similar program has operated in each of the three years mentioned.Common errors persist around:self education expenses where there is an insufficient connection between work activities and the self education at the time the expense was incurred, or where taxpayers claim self-development courses with no connection to current employment;car expenses using 'cents per kilometre' where there is no basis to support the claim or making incorrect claims for travel to and from work, including when taxpayers are on call, or travelling outside normal employment hours;home office expenses where incorrect calculations are made;asset purchases where the total cost of the asset is deducted, rather than calculating a decline in value of the asset; andapportionment, substantiation and mislabelling of deductions.The selection methodology consisted of a comprehensive analysis of claim patterns by occupation in the previous year. The occupations chosen to receive letters showed one or more of the following characteristics:larger than average claims or large increases in the average claim;high percentage contributions to the total increase in claims;large increases in the numbers of taxpayers claiming; andhigh rates of new claimers.</DOC>

Yes, I am aware that a painting named 'Women's Birthsite at the Rockhole Site of Wirrulunga' exhibited at the Australian Embassy in Paris has sustained minor damage. The cause and circumstances of the damage are yet to be determined.Yes. The cause, circumstances and timing of the damage remain unknown.615 guests.The main public reception area of the Embassy holds 800, with 600 in the main foyer and 200 in the adjacent multi-purpose space. In addition, guests had access to the 138 seat theatre for the duration of the evening.In addition to Embassy security personnel monitoring entry and exit of the building (including screening of all personal property), the Embassy employed four additional personnel to monitor the works. All staff members attending the event were thoroughly briefed to monitor the safety and security of the exhibition throughout the evening.Before the event, the Embassy discussed the organisation and layout of the room with the owner of the works and her team. It was agreed that ropes would be placed in several locations to guide guests. At the request of the owner, ropes were placed in areas of thoroughfare only and white tape was placed on the ground around other key works.In accordance with Commonwealth Government policy, the Australian Embassy Paris is a non-smoking environment. In France, smoking is not yet prohibited from the workplace and, as such, some guests may initially not have been aware of the Embassy's non-smoking policy. Against Embassy regulations, some attendees may have attempted to smoke at the function as Embassy staff instructed a number of attendees to desist.As noted above, the artworks were not roped off, although this was offered by the Embassy beforehand.Food and beverages were served in the same room as the artworks, as per the arrangements agreed to with the owner of the works before the event.Security personnel were hired to monitor the artworks.No, although several aspects of the policy have been subsequently reinforced, including the provision of condition report/s by the owner/touring gallery to the Embassy.This is the subject of ongoing discussion between the Embassy and the owner.Yes. No. Discussions with the paintings owner are ongoing.</DOC>

In October 2004, the CSA discussed the need to develop a communications strategy and plan with the Minister's office and informed the Minister that it intended to reengage Cosway Australia to assist. Cosway Australia had worked with the CSA on a number of previous occasions. At CSA's request, Cosway submitted a proposal to undertake the work. That proposal included using their partner company, Crosby Textor Research Strategies, to undertake part of the work, due to their expertise and Canberra location. CSA accepted this proposal, including the use of Crosby Textor on 16 November 2004 (not on 16 May 2005). The invoice for the services supplied, for $41,250, was issued by Crosby Textor Research Strategies to CSA on 11 April 2005 and paid in May 2005.The requirement was not put to tender. The reason for this was the plan needed to be developed quickly and the cost of the services was below the threshold required for a mandatory process. Crosby Textor was appointed based on their capability and experience, value for money, and their ability to undertake the work immediately.</DOC>

On 8 June 2006 the Minister also publicly announced a number of initiatives to provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra's processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in performing its compliance role. These initiatives have resulted in Telstra providing improved information about a consumer's right to have reasonable access to a payphone and enhancing its payphone removal consultation processes. Telstra has also consulted with low income groups regarding proposed payphone removals, and ACMA has improved its existing processes to provide a clear complaints process in relation to Telstra's adherence to its payphone commitments.(a) to (c) The numbers of Telstra-operated street-located payphones that have been removed, relocated and installed in the nine postcode areas in question since 2003 are as follows:Postcode areaRemovals from sites with single payphoneRemovals from sites with multiple payphonesTotal RemovalsRelocatedInstalled212722128221411115214211121431671122144336214522822160134142162112Total811191730 Telstra uses the universal service obligation Standard Marketing Plan (SMP), approved by ACMA, to make its payphone siting decisions.

Yes. The Department of Health and Ageing is managing a contract of $300,000 (over 3 years) for the Australian Breastfeeding Association to continue its work in breastfeeding promotion.Breastfeeding promotion activities funded by the Department of Health and Ageing over the past 10 years include:Australian Breastfeeding Association ($910,000  -  1998-2008)  -  volunteer organisation funded to promote and support breastfeeding in the Australian community through: training breastfeeding counsellors; updating breastfeeding training manuals; and establishing a breastfeeding case history database.National Child Nutrition Program (1999-00 - 2005-06) -  $2,170,000 of the total funding from the program was allocated to 15 projects that featured breastfeeding as a key component.Curtin University ($268,638  -  2002-03  -  2004-05) -  Perth Infant Feeding Study Mark 2 to monitor infant feeding practices among Perth mothers during the first 12 months of a baby's life.Australian College of Midwives ($230,000  -  2002-03  -  2004-05)  -  Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative to encourage all hospitals to become accredited as 'baby friendly' (ie, maternity facilities follow practices known to promote the health and wellbeing of babies and mothers including breastfeeding).National Health and Medical Research Council ($426,829  -  2000-01  -  2003-04)  -  Review of the Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents in Australia, incorporating theInfant Feeding Guidelines for Health Workers and Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults. These Guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding of babies until around six months and for all Australians to encourage and support breastfeeding mothers.National Breastfeeding Strategy ($2 million  -  1996 - 2001)  -  produced a range of resources for the general community, health workers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health service providers.Yes. The APMAIF recorded thirteen breaches of their agreement in the period 1999 to 2005.As the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formulas: Manufacturers and Importers Agreement 1992 (MAIF Agreement) is a voluntary self-regulatory agreement, the APMAIF cannot prosecute a company found in breach of it. In its Annual Report which is tabled in Parliament, APMAIF reports all breaches of the MAIF Agreement and the companies involved. Depending on the particular breach, APMAIF can request the company to withdraw the advertisement/s or print and circulate a correction to the material or information referred to in the complaint. The requirements of infant formula composition and labelling are set out in the Food Standards Code. State and territory health agencies implement and enforce the Food Standards Code, and breaches of infant formula labelling requirements are referred to them for consideration and action.The APMAIF guidelines for price promotions of infant formula are supported by the Department of Health and Ageing. The guidelines do not allow price tickets on baby milk formula to have any content other than the price, the name of the product and the amount to be saved.The MAIF Agreement covers the marketing of infant formula, including non milk formula, where the product is made in accordance with Food Standards Code Standard 2.9.1  -  Infant Formula Products. This standard only covers foods intended or represented for use as a substitute for breast milk and applies whether the product is in powder, liquid concentrate or 'ready to drink' form. The standard, and as a consequence MAIF Agreement, does not cover baby food which is not constituted specifically as a substitute for breast milk but to be provided as additional to either breast milk or infant formula.The Australian Government maintains its support for the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and in 2001 reviewed the scope of the MAIF Agreement (which gives effect in Australia to the principles of this code) to determine its continuing capacity to meet the objectives of the code. The Department of Health and Ageing is continuing to work with the signatories to the MAIF Agreement and other relevant bodies towards appropriate marketing of infant formula. It is recognised that the infant formula marketing environment has changed since the MAIF Agreement was developed in 1992 and the current Agreement does not cover the spectrum of advertising now in the market place.</DOC>

Yes. A combination of fixed and pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras are placed to maximise the fields of view of Customs cameras in the baggage make-up area. This arrangement of cameras means there is built - in redundancy of view so that if any camera is temporarily out of service, then there is still capacity to cover the entire area.Refer to Question 1 above.All areas within Camera 2's field of view were covered by other cameras.No. Refer to Question 2 above.</DOC>

In the first quarter of 2006 Customs undertook an internal review into operational procedures to ensure that episodes of suspected interference with CCTV cameras are quickly discovered, rectified, reported and dealt with by the appropriate authorities.While the Customs review found that standard operating procedures were being followed in relation to checking the proper functioning of cameras, reporting and rectification of any possible faults, it recommended a more rigorous checking and monitoring procedure, including a requirement for suspected tampering or interference to be reported to the appropriate areas within Customs and to the Joint Airport Investigation Teams.Customs has increased the frequency of camera checks to ensure the proper positioning and functioning of every camera. Additionally, as part of the Government's response to the Wheeler Review, Customs will receive funding over four years to expand and modernise its airport CCTV capability. This measure will increase Customs CCTV capability and significantly increase the recording and retention capacity of Customs CCTV footage. In respect of Sydney International Airport Customs' CCTV capacity has been increased from 66 to 92 cameras in the baggage make - up area.</DOC>

On 8 June 2006 the Minister publicly announced a number of initiatives that will provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra's processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in its compliance role. These initiatives will result in Telstra providing improved information about a customer's right to have reasonable access to a payphone and enhancing its payphone removal consultation processes. Telstra will also consult with low income groups regarding proposed payphone removals, and ACMA will improve its existing processes to provide a clear complaints process in relation to Telstra's adherence to its payphone commitments.Telstra has advised that there are 174 Telstra-operated street-located payphones in the electoral division of Melbourne Ports.Telstra has advised that it is unable to provide the number of Telstra-operated public telephones that have been removed from the electoral division of Melbourne Ports over the past five years, as its records from that time are not based on electoral division boundaries.Telstra has advised that a total of 18 Telstra-operated street-located payphones are scheduled for removal from the electoral division of Melbourne Ports in 2006.Telstra has advised that payphone removal decisions are based on an annual review that it undertakes in the first half of each year. For this reason, no specific information regarding payphone removals in the electoral division of Melbourne Ports is available for 2007.The Government recognises that access to payphones is an important community service and it is for this reason that the provision of payphones under the universal service obligation (USO) is set out in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The payphone USO provides that all people in Australia, wherever they live or work should have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to payphone services.Telstra is the primary universal service provider and is responsible for meeting the payphone USO. Payphones are provided in a competitive market. Telstra provides a little over half the number of payphones with the remainder being operated privately, for example, by small businesses or by providers like Tritel.How Telstra meets its USO is set out in its Standard Marketing Plan, which is approved by the telecommunications regulator, ACMA. This plan details how Telstra installs, removes and relocates payphones, as well as its service quality and fault rectification standards.Within this framework, Telstra has advised that each proposed payphone removal is also assessed in terms a range of other factors, including:distance to the nearest payphone;patronage levels;public safety issues;the frequency and extent of vandalism; andcomplaints from local residents or business.Telstra has advised that its assessment framework for the proposed removal of payphones contains a patronage component, which is a major determinant of demand. Telstra has further advised that it retains a market research company to conduct a customer survey each year with payphone users.</DOC>

On 8 June 2006 I announced a number of initiatives that will provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra's processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in its compliance role.As a result of these initiatives, Telstra has improved its consultation procedures in relation to the removal and relocation of its payphones situated in public places. I have also asked ACMA to pay particular attention to Telstra's payphone obligations to ensure that the public is adequately notified. In addition, Telstra has identified all of its universal service obligation (USO) payphones in towns and cities with a population of less than 50,000, and undertaken to vary its Standard Marketing Plan (SMP) for payphones to clarify its obligations.In relation to the removal of Telstra payphones, when a payphone is the only one at a public site, consultation must include the posting of a notice on the payphone for at least three months. The notice must indicate Telstra's intention to remove or relocate the payphone and the grounds on which it is proposing to remove or relocate the payphone, and must invite comments from interested parties. The removal notice will also include an explicit reference to the role of ACMA in monitoring Telstra's compliance with its USO. Telstra must also provide similar information to the local government authority.However, according to Telstra's SMP, a notice does not have to be posted on the payphone if it is removed from a private property. For payphones that Telstra proposes to remove from a private property, Telstra has advised that its consultation will only be with the site owner. As the 70 payphones referred to in the honourable member's question are located in commercial sites in the Adelaide electorate, Telstra will consult with the respective site owners.Telstra will make available, on request, to Commonwealth and state members of parliament the location of proposed local payphone installations, relocations and removals in their electorates.Telstra will now also consult regularly with the Low Income Measures Advisory Committee (LIMAC) on its payphone obligations and in particular its consultation and complaints processes. Telstra will formally consider any recommendations from LIMAC on payphone removals.Once a decision is made, Telstra will formally respond to any letter or email complaint it has received providing the grounds for the decision and advising that ACMA can be contacted if the complainant wishes to take the matter further.Telstra has advised that it provided a list of payphones and their street addresses to the office of the Member for Adelaide on 14 August 2006.See answer to part (1) for information about the consultation process.See the answer to part (1)Telstra has advised that the payphones that it proposes to remove from the electoral division of Adelaide are being provided by Telstra on a commercial basis over and above its USO requirements, and that they are not commercially viable.Telstra has advised that the payphones it proposes to remove from other Commonwealth electoral divisions are being provided by Telstra on a commercial basis over and above its USO requirements. Telstra has also advised that it is no longer commercially viable for it to maintain all of these payphones, and therefore some of the payphones will be removed.</DOC>

The Defence property located at Allara Street in Civic previously displayed this sign on the front mesh gate. This was an old sign that is believed to be a legacy from the original purpose of the site. Over the latter part of 2006, an upgrade of the facility was undertaken to cater for the needs of new Defence occupants of the site. This sign has now been removed.The site is not currently subject to any declaration under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952. Defence believes that the sign reflects the original purpose of the site from the late 1960s to early 1970s.There are currently no activities undertaken at this location which require a declaration under the Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952.</DOC>

Yes.Discussions have been held with the United States Department of Defense on options for the establishment of ground stations to support a number of communications systems to support United States Forces and for a satellite ground station for a future United States Government meteorological satellite system, the National Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System.and (e) To date, there is agreement to construct one facility, which will be a satellite ground station to support the United States Department of Defense's Mobile Users Objective System, which will be a system to provide mobile users narrow-band communication services in the UHF band. This satellite ground station is to be constructed on Defence land at Geraldton in Western Australia. Discussions on the possible hosting of other grounds stations, either at Geraldton or other locations, are continuing. Communication systems are capable of transmitting intelligence and intelligence-related information. The National Polar-Orbiting Environment Satellite System would provide United States Forces and other users with information on weather patterns across the globe. Negotiations are continuing, with the Bureau of Meteorology as the lead Australian Government agency, on the probable hosting of the site on Defence land at Geraldton.As stated above, the Australian Government has agreed that Australia will host a satellite ground station for the Mobile Users Objective System. This will be an unmanned ground station requiring only call-out contractor support and it will be subject to a full knowledge and concurrence regime. The Australian Government will ensure that it maintains full knowledge and concurrence over all capabilities belonging to, and activities conducted by, foreign governments in Australia. Any agreement to host a ground station to support any United States Department of Defense communications or weather system will be subject to agreement on an appropriate full knowledge and concurrence regime, and an assessment that the capability or activity benefits Australia's interests. The Australian Government has informed the United States Government that any hosting of United States Department of Defense communications ground stations in Australia should be in the context of a satellite communications partnership where we would work collaboratively on developing capabilities from which Australia and the United States would benefit fully.Discussions on communications capability improvements by both countries are held regularly between the Australian and United States Defence organisations. Informal discussions on the possible hosting of the satellite ground station for the Mobile Users Objective system commenced in 2003.The agreement to establish a satellite ground station for the Mobile Users Objective System on Defence land at Geraldton in Western Australia will be announced once the details are finalised.</DOC>

Australia Post has advised that it provides mail redirection and mail holding services at special rates to eligible concession card holders (that is, individuals with Centrelink Pensioner Concession Cards, Department of Veterans' Affairs Pensioner Concession Cards and Centrelink Health Care Cards (Sickness Allowance)). Australia Post has advised that prior to 22 May 2006 these services were available at no charge. Since then, Australia Post has indicated that they have been provided at a 50% discount on the full amount normally charged to households, which equates to a $5.50 charge for a one month redirection service for eligible customers.Australia Post has advised that it changed the charges for its pensioner redirection and holding service to:stop some customers from abusing what was intended to be a temporary service by using it on a long-term basis,help mitigate the rising costs of providing this service, andintroduce a concessional rate in line with concessional rates for other services.</DOC>

Contractors and consultants will play a key role in delivering the smartcard project. In managing these contracts a variety of measures will be used to ensure agreed outcomes are delivered. Minter Ellison has been engaged to provide specialist advice in this area. At this time I have no reason to believe the project will not be delivered in full, on time and on budget.At this point in time I do not expect to exceed the expenditure allocated to the smartcard project in the 2006-07 Budget.The savings associated with the introduction of the smartcard will be subject to continued review during the design, development and deployment stages.To prepare this answer it has taken 1 hour at an estimated cost of $63.</DOC>

Dr Tait was a member of the Booz Allen Hamilton team put forward for the project but he resigned and left Booz Allen Hamilton on 24 August 2006. Dr Tait's decision to leave consulting and pursue a career as the CIO of a major financial institution was a personal one. At no time did Dr Tait indicate to Booz Allen Hamilton or the Department of Human Services that it was due to dissatisfaction with the management of the project, a point he has reaffirmed since.Dr Tait was replaced in the Booz Allen Hamilton team by another consultant that my Department was satisfied brought commensurate skills and experience to the project team.Ms Johnson has been engaged as a non-ongoing employee. Ms Johnson was engaged as a Senior Executive Band 2, not a Deputy Secretary (Senior Executive Band 3). An open tender process was initially pursued for the Chief Technology Architect position. This process was unsuccessful in identifying a suitable candidate for this position. Following the conclusion of this process, Ms Johnson was approached on the basis of her relevant national and international experience and sound skills.The selection process complied with public service employment guidelines.Ms Johnson was engaged as a non-ongoing Senior Executive Band 2 employee to meet a specific skill need;Start date 10 October 2006, end date 10 October 2008;The selection process complied with public service employment guidelines;Privacy considerations prevent the release of individual salary details, however indicative salary ranges for core department employees can be found in Table 13 of Appendix 1 of the Department of Human Services Annual Report 2005-2006.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately three hours and thirty minutes at an estimated cost of $241.</DOC>

Yes.The Australian Government has put in place, through the airport lease and regulatory requirements, a regime to ensure the continued availability of Bankstown Airport as the major general aviation airport for the Sydney region.Bankstown Airport's Master Plan forecasts that around 84.1 per cent of aircraft movements over the next 20 years will be by typical general aviation aircraft, a significant proportion of which will be pilot training activity.While this is primarily a commercial matter for BAL, the approved Bankstown Airport Master Plan forecasts the introduction of niche passenger services and continuing parcel freight operations. This is publicly available on the Bankstown Airport Limited website:http://www.bankstownairport.com.au.Heavy freight can only be carried through Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport because of capacity restrictions at the Bankstown Airport.Aircraft noise over the next twenty years, including passenger and freight aircraft, is forecast in the approved Master Plan. The Master Plan is publicly available on the Bankstown Airport Limited website:http://www.bankstownairport.com.au.The Bankstown Airport Master Plan sets out the differing commercial markets served by Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport.No. The use of Bankstown Airport as an 'overflow airport' for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is not being considered. The operation of Bankstown Airport as an 'overflow' airport is not part of its approved Master Plan, nor is it proposed by BAL.See (6) above.Airservices Australia has provided the following statistics:Below are statistics of arrivals, departures and circuit flights for Bankstown Airport for the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive: They have been classified by engine size:

The Skills for the Future programme announced by the Prime Minister on 12 October has been advertised as part of a broader Skills for the Future public information campaign. The Skills for the Future campaign is a national information campaign which aims to inform Australians of a range of career and training opportunities available to them within a skills needs environment. The campaign promotes a range of initiatives and why it is a good time for Australians of all ages to consider re-skilling for a career change and particularly taking up an Australian Apprenticeship. The campaign also highlights the range of career opportunities available to young Australians and the assistance available to them such as the Australian Apprenticeships Scheme, Australian Technical Colleges and the new Career Advice Australia network.The campaign also promotes the Australian Skills Vouchers Programme (announced under the range of initiatives by the Prime Minister on 12 October) which targets Australians 25 years and over to help them start or upgrade their qualifications.The campaign was launched on 22 October 2006 and involved six television commercials which were supported by radio, print, cinema and internet advertising.The total cost of the Skills for the Future public information campaign is estimated at $20.5 million. This includes the cost of the media buy, and the cost of the research and creative agency. Until the campaign is finalised this cost is indicative only.The placements for the media buy for the Skills for the Future Campaign First Phase, as requested, is at Attachment A and has been provided by the Australian Government's master media agency for campaign advertising, Universal McCann. Please note that the costs of individual advertisement placements are commercial-in-confidence. Until the campaign is finalised a full media buy breakdown including dates and times cannot be provided.See (b) above.The advertising campaign will run up until the week commencing 4 March 2007.

In December 2005, an examination of the affairs of the Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation (NAC) was conducted pursuant to section 60 of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (the ACA Act). After a review of the findings of the examination, the delegate of the Registrar concluded there may be grounds for the appointment of an Administrator. On 16 January 2006, the Registrar served a notice in writing calling on the corporation to show cause by the close of business on Tuesday, 31 January 2006 why an Administrator should not be appointed to NAC. This time was extended to 3 March 2006 by the Registrar at the request of the corporation and the corporation replied on 2, 3 10, 21 and 24 February 2006. Having considered the corporation's replies to the notice, the Registrar decided to recommend the appointment of an Administrator under section 71(2) of the Act as she was satisfied that there were grounds to appoint the Administrator. The Registrar sought the approval of the Minister to appoint an Administrator to NAC and the Minister approved the appointment on 18 April 2006. On 26 April 2006, the Registrar executed an instrument to appoint Mr Eamonn Thackaberry of Chalgrove Projects Pty Ltd as the Administrator to NAC effective from 28 April 2006. In addition, the Registrar published a notice in the Gazette and in a newspaper of the appointment of Mr Eamonn Thackaberry as Administrator from 28 April 2006.The Registrar did not undertake an investigation into NAC under section 68(1) of the ACA Act.No investigation was undertaken, so no findings can be reported.The Registrar appointed the Administrator to NAC on four grounds in accordance with section 71(2) of the ACA Act. Firstly, the corporation traded at a loss for at least six months during the preceding 12 months: section 71(2)(a) of the ACA Act. Secondly, the corporation failed to comply with a provision of the ACA Act and/or regulations and/or provisions of the corporation's rules: section 71(2)(b) of the ACA Act. Thirdly, the appointment of the Administrator was deemed to be in the interest of the corporation, its members and creditors: section 71(1)(2)(d) of the ACA Act. Fourthly, the appointment of an Administrator was deemed to be in the public interest: section 71(2)(f) of the ACA Act.The Administrator is responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation and, in addition, has the functions of the public officer pursuant to section 75 of ACA Act. The Administrator has been appointed to address the concerns underlying the grounds for his appointment. These include: a range of governance issues, such as, the lack of a Register of Members, failure to hold Annual General Meetings, and improper election procedures; significant trading loss over a 15 month period; weak internal controls and lack of documented policies and procedures; and poor reporting and filing of returns.The Administrator of NAC is required to report to the Registrar from time to time as the Registrar requires under section 77C of the ACA Act. The Administrator has been reporting to the Registrar regularly since the commencement of his appointment.The Administrator is working with NAC to ensure a viable corporation and secondary college in the Northern Territory.The Registrar is unable to provide a timeline because the Administrator is currently in the process of ascertaining all relevant information, considering that information and developing an overall strategy for the administration.Currently, the Registrar is unable to provide a timeline for the return of the day - to - day conduct of the affairs of NAC to the corporation's members as the administration is in its early stages of gathering information and implementing a plan for the administration.The Administrator has incurred expenses in relation to travel, travel allowance and legal costs. The Registrar has paid the Administrator for these expenses in the amount of $27,640.00 (exclusive of GST) as at 11 December 2006.To date, the Registrar has not charged the Administrator's remuneration, charges and expenses on the property of NAC.The Registrar has paid $153,720.00 (exclusive of GST) to the Administrator for remuneration as at 11 December 2006.The Administrator is responsible for the conduct of the affairs of NAC. He also has the functions and duties of the public officer under section 75 of the ACA Act. As part of his role of conducting the affairs of NAC, the Administrator manages the operation of Nyangatjatjara College.On 1 December 2006, an action was commenced in the Federal Court of Australia by members of NAC in relation to the management and administration of Nyangatjatjara College. As the matter is sub judice, no details can be provided at this time.</DOC>

From 1 July 2006 to 1 December 2006 there were 22 customers in the federal electorate of Canberra who had an eight-week non-payment period applied. Customers affected were either in receipt of Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance. Due to privacy considerations a detailed breakdown of numbers cannot be provided, as the number is less than 20 in each of these groups.The reasons were as follows:
Reason for non-payment period
Number of Customers
Failure to attend reconnection appointment&lt;20Failed to attend interview with Employment Service Provider&lt;20Dismissed from employment due to misconduct&lt;20Failure to accept a suitable offer of employment&lt;20Voluntarily unemployed&lt;20
 
 All cells that have a value of less than 20, other than zero, have been changed to display '&lt;20'. This rule has been employed for privacy reasons2 Participation Failure, when applied on its own, does not warrant an eight-week non-payment period.A customer may incur an eight-week non-payment period if they fail to meet their participation requirement (without a reasonable excuse) three times in a twelve-month period.Data provided is point in time data and may change at any time as a result of any reviews or pending appeals.Data Source: Data produced by Centrelink Data Services. Centrelink extracted the data by SAS for the period 1 July to the week ending 1 December 2006.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 21 hours and 31 minutes at an estimated cost of $1,094.</DOC>

No.No.The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has not allocated any regional funding to off-set any job or business losses that have occurred as a result of abattoir closures in the last five years.The Australian Government would require the consent of the sovereign government of the importing country to inspect slaughter facilities. The Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) on Handling and Slaughter of Live Australian Animals with Egypt provides for regular inspections of Egyptian animal handling facilities and approved slaughter houses.The Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (the Standards) take into account World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) animal welfare guidelines and in most instances exceed them.        Relevant sections of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations were drawn upon in the development of Standard 6 - Air Transport of Livestock in the Standards and therefore comply with the IATA regulations.</DOC>

The decrease in Australia's defence cooperation budget with Thailand from 2004-05 to 2005-06 is explained by an unusually high take-up rate of Australian training courses by candidates from the Royal Thai Armed Forces in 2004-05. One of the training courses utilised in 2004-05 was flying instructor training, which is high cost (approximately $500,000).and (5) The Government is maintaining defence cooperation with Thailand where such cooperation is in Australia's security interests. The Government will continue to monitor developments in Thailand and will review the defence cooperation program if appropriate., (b), (c), (d) and (e) Yes.No.</DOC>

The program's producers were advised of the decision in early September 2006.The decision was made by ABC management. No discussions or communications took place between the Minister, or any Ministerial advisers, and the ABC with respect to this decision.</DOC>

It would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for my department to cover in its response all Australian Government activities undertaken to promote sustainable forest management and to combat illegal logging in the Asia-Pacific region for each of the past ten financial years. The following information therefore relates to activities undertaken by my Department and portfolio agencies.
DFAT
Australia works with many countries, including those of the Asia-Pacific region, on a range of forestry issues in a number of multilateral fora. These include the United Nations Forum on Forests, the International Tropical Timber Organisation, the Asia Forest Partnership, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Taskforce. Given the multilateral nature of these fora and their global impact, it would be an unreasonable diversion of resources to isolate and quantify the costs of instances of cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific region to promote sustainable forest management and to combat illegal logging over the past ten financial years.Australia also raises forestry and logging issues on an ongoing basis during a broad range of relevant bilateral official and ministerial meetings, including at the request of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the Department of the Environment and Heritage. It would be an unreasonable diversion of resources to list, and determine the costs of, each occasion on which DFAT discussed forestry and logging issues with each country in the Asia-Pacific region for each of the past ten financial years.Within my portfolio, a number of initiatives to promote sustainable forest management and to combat illegal logging are also managed through the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, (ACIAR).
ACIAR
The following projects cover the promotion and improvement of plantation and agroforestry activities, the protection of plantations and mature forests from pests, diseases and fire and the sustainable management of native forests. Some projects are conducted in cooperation with DAFF, or extend beyond the Asia-Pacific region.

 communications; engineering and construction; and the F-FDTL training base at Metinaro, which was built by Australia.Prior to the violence in April/May 2006, Defence had 25 DCP personnel posted to East Timor. This figure was reduced to 17 in August 2006 to align staff with the reduced DCP effort. Presently, DCP personnel provide assistance to East Timor's Ministry of Defence and the F-FDTL. DCP staff is assisting in the areas of communications; engineering and construction; English language training; leadership training; first aid training; civil-military operations; and management and governance., (b) (iii) and (c) (iii) Our benchmarks for success will be an F-FDTL that is responsive to lawful government direction; has the capacity to meet appropriate East Timorese security needs, particularly with respect to maritime security, border security, and nation-building tasks; and is disciplined and well administered. Given the current limited capacity of the F-FDTL, a number of these benchmarks are likely to take several years to fully achieve. The Government is, therefore, committed to providing a significant level of DCP assistance to the F-FDTL over the long term.(ii); (b) (i) (ii) and (c) (i) (ii) and (7) These questions should be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</DOC>

Yes. This information is classified and cannot be released.Following a reassessment of the security situation in 2005, the Government decided to again send troops to Afghanistan. A Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to Afghanistan for 12 months. The SFTG's deployment occurred at a crucial time for the Afghanistan government as it faced significant challenges in extending its authority beyond the capital, Kabul, in its bid to secure national unity. The SFTG deployment was not extended beyond 12 months due to the high operational tempo and heavy workload, as well as the broader effort in Afghanistan, which now focuses on reconstruction. Within that context, Defence has deployed a Reconstruction Task Force (RTF) with a robust force protection element commensurate with the threat within the Oruzgan province to meet the international community's intent to rebuild the country.Defence continually assesses the situation in Afghanistan in the context of our current RTF and other possible contributions. The Government may consider the provision of additional capability should it be considered necessary.The SFTG provided reconnaissance, surveillance, and other specialised capabilities to the United States led coalition's operations against Al Qaida and the Taliban. The SFTG also conducted non-combat operations, which included providing medical and veterinary support, assistance for local schools, and humanitarian support. The Government cannot comment on the actual capabilities of foreign military forces.The Government agrees that the future development and success of Afghanistan's national security services will be dependent on international support, and we note the progress made by the Afghan national security forces, and the significant contributions made by the international community. It is important that Australia and the international community continue to assist the Afghanistan government in this process.While international military forces have no direct role in the development of Afghanistan's economy, the international community is placing significant effort into the development of the Afghan economy and the Afghanistan Government's ability to responsibly manage its economic affairs. The Afghanistan Compact, for example, is the result of consultation between the Afghanistan Government, the United Nations and the international community, and represents a framework for cooperation over the next five years, which focuses on further developing Afghanistan's economic responsibility.The Government does not comment on the specific initiatives of other governments. One of the important tasks of the ADF RTF is to provide trade skills training for the local population in Oruzgan and engineering training skills for the Afghan security forces.One of the important tasks of the ADF RTF is to not only provide trade skills training for the local population in Oruzgan, but engineering training skills for the Afghan security forces as well. The Australian Government is committed to assisting the Afghanistan government achieve security and stability, and would consider any formal requests for training assistance.and (b) This is a matter for the Afghanistan government.(a) and (b) The Australian Government understands that there are no specific Afghan National Army or police training targets for Oruzgan province. A national target of 70,000 Afghan National Army personnel is anticipated by October 2008, and by the end of 2010 it is anticipated that a fully functional and ethnically balanced Afghan National Police and Afghan Border Police with a combined force of up to 62,000 will be able to meet the security needs of the country and be increasingly fiscally sustainable.The Government is aware of such claims made against former Oruzgan Governor Jan Mohammad. The Government recognises the current Oruzgan Governor Monib as the legitimate government-appointed authority in the province. Any decisions made by a former governor would be an internal matter for the Afghanistan government.Australia encourages an inclusive form of government that governs for all. Although we are aware that a broad array of tribes and ethnic groups with diverse and differing views exist in Afghanistan, we recognise that the Afghan people are working hard to achieve stability, peace and democracy after many years of violence and extremism. Afghanistan will continue to face challenges on its path towards democracy and security, however, Australia and other members of the international community will continue to provide assistance to the Afghan people.The Government is aware of the report by the International Crisis Group on 2 November 2006. However, this information is classified and cannot be released.This information is classified and cannot be released.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Alexander Downer MP, has written to Foreign Minister Kasuri asking Pakistan to increase efforts to curtail the cross border movements of Taliban-led insurgents to and from Afghanistan.Defence does hot have the exact figures on the number of attacks on schools and how many have closed in Oruzgan. Australia's RTF is assisting the Government of Afghanistan establish security and reconstruction, including the rebuilding of a local high school, in order to facilitate Afghanistan's long-term peace, stability and development. This includes providing education opportunities for Afghan men, women and children.The Government is aware of the report by the International Crisis Group on 2 November 2006. However, information held by Australia remains operationally sensitive and cannot be released to the public.The Government is not in a position to confirm the figures provided. The United Nations Office on Drug and Crime Afghanistan Opium Survey 2006 reports that opium cultivation per hectare in 2005 in the southern region of Afghanistan decreased from 2004 levels, but in 2006 opium production levels in the southern region increased.International Security Assistance Force, including Australia, is committed to supporting the Afghanistan Government in the development and prosecution of its National Drug Control Strategy (NDCS) through the improvement of security, national institutions and infrastructure.        The United Kingdom leads support among the international community for the Afghanistan Government to tackle the narcotics trade.        The international community is encouraging the delivery of the Afghanistan Government's updated NDCS, which was launched at the London Conference on Afghanistan, 31 January - 1 February 2006. The NDCS set out the Afghanistan Government's counter narcotics policies over the next five years, and highlights four key priorities where activity is likely to make the greatest impact in the short-term, namely: targeting the trafficker and the trade, strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods, developing effective counter narcotics institutions and demand reduction.Yes. Australia has provided $4.5 million in direct support of counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan.The Government has committed an appropriate contribution to Afghanistan as part of our commitment towards working together with the international community to help prevent acts of terrorism. Australia is able to adequately provide logistic and intelligence resources to support Australian troops in Afghanistan, irrespective of our commitment in Iraq.</DOC>

No AWB shipment of wheat was delivered by AusAID. Further, no AusAID officer or AusAID consultant contacted or attempted to contact Alia in relation to the AWB Ltd wheat shipment in April 2003.Not applicable.No Australian government department or agency had responsibilities for overseeing arrangements for the unloading and internal distribution in Iraq of the AWB shipments. Under the Oil for Food program AWB Ltd shipments were the responsibility of the United Nations. With commencement of hostilities imminent, the United Nations on 17 March 2003 evacuated all staff from Iraq and suspended the Oil for Food program  -  effectively stranding two AWB Ltd wheat shipments totalling 100,860 metric tonnes. At this point, AWB Ltd approached the government to take over the two shipments. The government agreed to do so to meet humanitarian relief needs and AusAID began negotiations with AWB Ltd. Through these negotiations AusAID concluded a competitive, fixed price contract for the wheat. The contract was gazetted on 31 March 2003.        Parallel to negotiations with the AWB Ltd, AusAID was negotiating with the United Nations World Food Programme to manage the storage, milling, bagging and distribution of the 100,860 metric tones of wheat. At no time did AusAID or its consultants contact Alia in this process. The World Food Programme and AusAID agreed a cost of $45m for the storage, milling, bagging and distribution of the 100,860 metric tones of wheat throughout Iraq. Prior to AusAID concluding a formal arrangement with the World Food Programme, hostilities in Iraq dramatically reduced and the United Nations returned.        With the rapid return of the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council reinstatement of the Oil for Food program on 28 March 2003, the United Nations approached Australia seeking the return of the 100,860 metric tonnes to its reinstated program. The United Nations also requested that the Australian humanitarian funds thus freed-up be provided for immediate humanitarian activities and follow-on reconstruction activities. The Australian government agreed to both requests and the 100,860 metric tonne of Australian wheat reverted to the United Nations. This outcome was subject of a media release from Foreign Minister Downer (AA 03 017 of 9 April 2003). The contract between AusAID and AWB Ltd was cancelled and AWB Ltd returned all funds to AusAID on 30 April 2003.</DOC>

Centrelink has deployed WebCapture into its Online Service delivery framework as a means of meeting its obligations under the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 with respect to the recording and retention of information contained in electronic transactions.With respect to the individual parts of the question:Web Capture records only authenticated transactional sessions that occur after a user has 'logged on' to Centrelink secure Online Services and selects an option from the self-service menu. WebCapture records all screens submitted by the user until they exit self-service by logging off, closing their browser or navigating to another web site.The monthly breakdown of WebCapture sessions recorded since January 2005, to the end of November 2006 is as follows:MonthSessionsJan-05188,923Feb-05184,268Mar-05226,196Apr-05228,108May-05246,129Jun-05306,043Aug-05451,100Sep-05387,134Oct-05390,772Nov-05485,148Dec-05387,070Jan-06448,312Feb-06443,439Mar-06500,500Apr-06479,773May-06605,438Jun-06830,504Jul-06927,161Aug-06736,225Sep-06520,281Oct-06630,770Nov-06658,854Since its installation in 2002, WebCapture has recorded a total of 13,236,548 sessions.Access to WebCapture records is restricted to those Centrelink staff who have a direct responsibility for monitoring, supporting or investigating Online Service transactions.Centrelink retains WebCapture records for seven years in accordance with the provisions of the Archives Act 1983.Management information retained by Centrelink, relating to the investigation of suspect transactions does not include details of the information systems examined during each investigation.Centrelink has no plans to extend the use of WebCapture.WebCapture records have twice been submitted as part of the evidence of Centrelink related offences. In the first instance, the evidence was not contested as the offender entered a guilty plea. The remaining matter has yet to heard by the Court.As per Centrelink's standard practice, an internal assessment of WebCapture was conducted and signed off by Centrelink's Privacy and Information Access Team. It was determined that no formal Privacy Impact Assessment was required.WebCapture was identified by Centrelink as meeting the requirements for a logging capability to support the deployment of Online Services in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Electronics Transactions Act 1999.There have been no instances of unauthorised access to WebCapture records.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 9 hours and 41 minutes at an estimated cost of $505.</DOC>

MOUs do not contain information relating to slaughter practices. Australia works as a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE) with countries in the Middle East to support efforts to improve animal handling and facilities, from offloading at port until the point of slaughter, to ensure world's best practice.Australia is considering whether it would be possible to negotiate a GCC-wide MOU, or similar instrument, in parallel with prospective free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Were an MOU to form part of a GCC FTA  -  as either a chapter or annex  -  it would have treaty status and be legally binding.</DOC>

With the additional funding made available to Customs in the 2005 - 06 Budget to enhance the CCTV capability in Australian Airports the number of cameras in the Sydney baggage make - up area increased to 92.Customs does not operate cameras at Sydney Domestic Airport.CCTV camera control room operators can, if required for operational reasons, control electronically (a) the field of view and (b) the focus of pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras from their control room.Yes. However, the field of view or focus is rarely adjusted manually for PTZ or fixed cameras. If, for service reasons, such an adjustment is required, it is necessary to dismantle the camera housing to undertake that adjustment. (a) Manual adjustment of the view or focus of the Customs CCTV cameras would normally be undertaken by the service maintenance contractor. (b) The service contractor would be required to dismantle the camera housing to undertake any necessary adjustment. (c) and (d) Adjustments would be made as a result of a service request, in association with normal ongoing maintenance procedures, or to accommodate operational changes.No. Camera 1 was reported as having 'no focus' on 23 October 2004. Maintenance checks carried out on 17 October 2004 indicate that Camera 1 was functional at that time.Camera 1 was found to have 'no focus' on 23 October 2004.The fault was reported to the maintenance service provider on the same day, 23 October 2004.Customs CCTV control room operators followed normal operating procedures to report the fault identified in Camera 1, but this did not include a physical inspection.Customs Sydney International Airport maintenance contractor, Bemac Security Pty Ltd, undertook a physical inspection of Camera 1 in order to rectify the fault identified.A Customs officer detected that Camera 1 was out of focus.The Customs officer's response was in accordance with standard operating procedures which are not crime scene procedures. In the normal course of events, the fault with Camera 1 would not constitute a crime scene. (a) Customs Level 1. (b) The Customs officer followed normal operating procedures and reported the fault.The Customs officer who observed that Camera 1 had 'no focus' on 23 October 2004 instigated a written service report on the same day (23 October), in accordance with normal operating procedures. (b) A written service report is provided to the maintenance contractor. (c) The report was forwarded to the Customs Sydney International Airport maintenance contractor, Bemac Security Pty Ltd, in accordance with standard operating procedures. (d) 23 October 2004. (e) Bemac Security Pty Ltd undertook a physical inspection of Camera 1 to rectify the fault on 29 October 2004.The Customs officer followed normal operating procedures to report the fault.The Customs officer followed normal operating procedures and instigated a service report. There was no requirement for a further incident report.Refer to Question 11 above.Refer to Question 11 above.Refer to Question 9 above.Refer to Question 9 above.Refer to Question 9 above.Customs Level 1.The fault identified in Camera 1 on 23 October 2004 was rectified in accordance with the timeframes specified in the maintenance contract with Bemac Security Pty Ltd.Yes, Bemac Security Pty Ltd did provide a report to Customs.Customs does have a definition of 'operational effectiveness'.

A combination of fixed and pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras are placed to maximise the fields of view of Customs cameras in the baggage make-up area. This arrangement of cameras means there is built - in redundancy of view so that if any camera is temporarily out of service then there is still capacity to cover the entire area.Although these cameras have the capacity to replicate the field of view lines of Camera 1 and Camera 2, should that be required to cover Customs operational requirements, not all cameras continuously record. There is no Customs recorded footage available from the cameras in the baggage make-up area.</DOC>

Yes.There has been an acknowledged increasing demand for shark fin, but it is difficult to determine the extent to which shark finning occurs. International pressure to manage shark finning has certainly increased.Scientific evidence has been collected over many years and in many countries which demonstrates depletion of shark populations. In response the international community, through the auspices of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, has introduced an International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.Some countries/organisations have determined that the amount of fin on board should be no greater than a certain percentage of the carcass weight to ensure the ban on finning is effectively implemented and that carcasses are not discarded at sea. A typical ratio is that the wet weight of fin on board should be no more than 5 per cent of the carcass weight. The appropriate ratio will vary from species to species.I am advised that the European Parliament recently rejected a recommendation to increase the allowable fin to carcass ratio from 5% to 6.5% whole weight and instead voted overwhelmingly in favour of a decrease in the ratio to 2% of whole weight.The US have set the ratio to be 5 per cent of dressed weight (the weight after the shark has been beheaded and gutted) or about 2.5 percent of the whole weight.In Commonwealth managed fisheries, shark finning, as it refers to the on-board removal of a shark's fins and the discarding of the remainder of the shark at sea, is banned. In state managed fisheries, various fin to carcass weight ratios are used as a means of managing legal take.Australia continues to promote management of shark-finning and advocate Australia's management measures in international organisations, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation and through Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.</DOC>

As cars run by Defence predominantly use Unleaded Petrol (ULP), figures for ULP expenditure have been extracted. Unavoidably, these figures will include expenditure for fuel used in other equipment such as brush cutters and lawn mowers; however, expenditure for these purposes is not considered material.The total ULP expenditure for Defence was:2000-01 - $3.688 million2001-02 - $6.972 million2002-03 - $5.849 million2003-04 - $6.108 million2004-05 - $5.797 million2005-06 - $7.136 millionDefence Housing Australia (DHA):DHA does not operate 'Commonwealth cars' as all vehicles are leased from commercial leasing organisations (Custom Fleet or LeasePlan). Since November 2005, all new lease vehicles are sourced from LeasePlan under the Commonwealth Fleet Management Agreement.The fuel costs for DHA leased vehicles are:2000-01 - $ 421,1962001-02 - $ 463,7782002-03 - $ 548,3692003-04 - $ 712,9132004-05 - $ 1,321,7922005-06 - $ 1,472,324Some of the costs advised above include minor maintenance items not included within the vehicle lease terms, such as unscheduled tyre replacement or servicing of vehicles. These items are associated with the same cost codes used by DHA for fuel purchases. It would involve a considerable diversion of resources to identify the relatively minor portion of expenses within these cost codes which are not related to purchase of fuel.</DOC>

Formal evaluation was undertaken via telephone surveys designed specifically for the campaign. The surveys indicated that:the ACCC's campaign met its primary objectives in generating and increasing awareness and knowledge amongst all smokers, including those of 'light' and 'mild' cigarettes, that such cigarettes do not provide health benefits and are not less harmful than regular (full strength) cigarettes.there was a significant increase in the proportion of smokers who learnt that lighter cigarettes are just as bad for me; andthere was also a significant decrease in the mean number of cigarettes smoked per week by casual smokers of 'light' and 'mild' cigarettes.The Cancer Council of Victoria, on behalf of the Quit network organisations, also reported there was an immediate increase in calls to the national Quitline as soon as the campaign commenced, indicating that the secondary objective of the campaign, to encourage smokers to call the Quitline for assistance in quitting cigarettes, was also successful.</DOC>

The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has portfolio responsibility for the export of live animals from Australia, including associated agreements. This answer has, therefore, been developed in consultation with his Department.Bahrain: Supports the MOU concept in principle but has expressed concerns that the limited capacity of its quarantine facility means that Bahrain could accept an MOU only if it were the final port of call for a shipment. Negotiations are continuing with industry on potential operational changes to address these concerns.Oman: Ad referendum agreement has been reached with Omani officials on text of an MOU with Oman. The MOU is currently subject to internal Omani Government consideration and legal clearance of the text (the MOU is currently with the Omani Ministry of Law for clearance).Qatar: Ad referendum agreement has been reached with Qatari officials on the text of an MOU and discussions are underway on arrangements for signing.Egypt: The MOU with Egypt was signed on 3 October 2006.Israel: Has indicated it is not willing to consider the concept of an MOU on the live animal trade. The Government plans to make further representations on the MOU to Israel.Lebanon: The Government has made representations and is awaiting a formal response.See answers above (ii)-(vii).See answers under 1 (a).</DOC>

A combination of fixed and pan tilt zoom (PTZ) cameras are placed to maximise the fields of view of Customs cameras in the baggage make-up area. This arrangement of cameras means there is built - in redundancy of view so that if any camera is temporarily out of service, then there is still capacity to cover the entire area.Refer to Question 1 above.All areas within Camera 1's field of view were covered by other cameras.Refer to Question 3 above. There is no Customs recorded footage available from the cameras in the baggage make up area, nor is there any record available to confirm whether the cameras were recording at the times in question.Refer to Question 1 above. I am unable to answer this question on behalf of other entities at Sydney International Airport.The cameras have the capacity to cover the entire area should that be required to cover Customs operational requirements, but not all cameras continuously record.</DOC>

On 8 June 2006 the Minister also publicly announced a number of initiatives to provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra's processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in its compliance role. As a result of these initiatives, Telstra has improved its consultation procedures in relation to the removal and relocation of its payphones situated in public places. In addition, Telstra has identified all of its universal service obligation payphones in towns and cities with a population of less than 50,000, and undertaken to vary its standard marketing plan for payphones to clarify its obligations. Telstra has also consulted with low income groups regarding proposed payphone removals, and ACMA has improved its existing processes to provide a clear complaints process in relation to Telstra's adherence to its payphone commitments.Telstra has advised that one Telstra payphone was removed from the electoral division of Wills in the 2005-2006 financial year. The payphone was removed from Lorenson Avenue, Coburg North.Telstra has advised that three Telstra payphones are being considered for removal in the electoral division of Wills in the 2006-2007 financial year. These are located at Mascoma Street, Strathmore, Woodland Street, Strathmore, and outside the Fawkner Crematorium, Sydney Road.Telstra has advised that it assesses plans to remove payphones on an annual basis. Telstra has therefore advised that it does not have specific data on the number of payphones that will be considered for removal in the electoral division of Wills for the 2007-2008 financial year.</DOC>

The Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Robert Hill, said that broadly based sanctions within the United Nations context were more likely to be effective than unilateral sanctions. This is the government's position.The Australian Government is aware of and condemns comments made by Iran's President Ahmadinejad on 3 August 2006. Such comments are reprehensible and unacceptable, and Australia joins the international community in unreservedly denouncing these and other similar remarks made by elements of the Iranian regime. In this context, Australia remains firmly committed to the pursuit of diplomatic efforts to address the concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear programme and strongly urges Iran to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737.The Australian Government is putting in place financial sanctions against Iran as part of its compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737. The resolution includes financial sanctions on individuals and entities listed by the Security Council or Sanctions Committee for their involvement in Iran's nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems.</DOC>

The design of the Electromagnetic Health Complaints Register involved widespread consultation and required approximately 0.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) at the Executive Level 1. The ongoing maintenance requires an annual 0.02 FTE at the same level.The Government's response to Recommendation 2.7 was  -  'The Government is aware of the concerns held by some users of radiofrequency technologies about the possible health effects of such devices. The Government accepts the establishment of a centralised complaints mechanism. It is proposed that ARPANSA will implement and manage a complaints register. The register may identify emerging issues as well as possible activities. This information would be shared with the public and industry (via ARPANSA's website) as well as other Commonwealth agencies'. ARPANSA has established and maintained the Complaints Register and places an annual analysis on the ARPANSA website. ARPANSA views the complaints register as one component in a program to protect against and to inform the public about potential adverse health effects from exposure to electromagnetic radiation in the environment.No criteria have been established to judge the effectiveness of the Complaints Register.The register was launched via an ARPANSA media release on 4 July 2003. The media release was placed on the ARPANSA web site and a direct link to an information page and submission form has been on the ARPANSA home page since 26 September 2003.The media release was distributed to 168 major daily and major regional newspapers, posted on the Australian Associated Press web site and distributed to the Australian Medical Association, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australasian Science Journal. Later in 2003 it was further distributed to: The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges, Australasian Faculty of Occupational Medicine, Australian and New Zealand Society of Occupational Medicine and the Australian Divisions of General Practice.ARPANSA has contact with various community-based groups with an interest in health effects of EMR and a large number of copies of the media release and complaints submissions form have been distributed to interested persons in the community. Through enquiries to ARPANSA by telephone and e-mail, nearly another 900 submission forms have been sent to interested persons. Links to the ARPANSA web pages concerning the register have appeared or do appear on the web pages of other government agencies and interest groups.During 2006 the ARPANSA website was viewed on over 900,000 occasions. The Complaints Register was viewed on 2,000 occasions and the submission form was downloaded approximately once per day.The consensus of scientific opinion in Australia and internationally is that there are no established adverse health effects arising from exposure to electromagnetic energy at levels normally encountered in the environment. The most appropriate action is for ARPANSA to continue to monitor the published scientific literature and to advise government as appropriate.Having regard for the answer to Question (5) there is no justification to undertake a nation-wide health audit of people living and working near low and high impact mobile telephone base stations across Australia.</DOC>

Arrangements for access to these records vary according to the type of information involved. Access to staff records, for example, is limited to the relevant work areas with that responsibility. Audit logs are kept of access, printing and for e-mail dispatch. In the case of the information held in our passports database (PICS), individual access to, and use of, personal data is recorded down to the keystroke and is subject to regular audits by the Australian National Audit Office. All activity generated in PICS is monitored by the System Administrator with monthly reports scrutinised by senior management.In relation to consular records our current consular case management system provides us with good audit trail capabilities on individuals who access the system with the ability to limit access to relevant case officers and supervisors. These capabilities are being further strengthened in the current development of our new system. Consular Operations staff have a strong privacy culture and protecting the privacy of our consular clients is an important focus of the Department's consular and security training programs.

At present user logs are audited in both a reactive and proactive manner. If it is assumed a user is wrongfully accessing records or if it is found that a record has been modified then logs will be examined. In addition, randomly chosen clients records are audited to determine if their records have been incorrectly accessed. Randomly selected user accounts are also audited; in this situation the records they have accessed are investigated for improper use.There are procedures in place to ensure staff access privileges are removed if they are no longer required. For example, if a staff member moves into a position where their previous access privileges are not required, their access will be removed.</DOC>

The former Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP actually said in December 2000 that 'the sale conditions for Bankstown Airport will encourage its operator to upgrade the airport so it will operate as an overflow for Sydney Airport and, in time, become an attractive alternative for some airline services.' This view was qualified by the Acting Minister for Transport, Wilson Tuckey MP in April 2003, who said that 'changes to the aviation environment since 11 September 2001, the collapse of Ansett and the trend to using larger aircraft, particularly on regional routes, means there is no longer a need for Bankstown Airport to develop an overflow capacity to supplement Sydney Airport.'Please refer to Part B of the approved Bankstown Airport Master Plan on the Bankstown Airport Limited website: http://www.bankstownairport.com.au.Yes.Yes. The Sydney Airport Master Plan, which was approved by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP in March 2004, indicates a capacity to meet Sydney's forecast future traffic growth over the twenty-year planning period to 2023/24, without projecting a need for additional runway infrastructure beyond an upgrade of the airfield system (taxiways, aprons, etc) and supporting aviation technology.The most recent aircraft actual and forecast movements for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, which cover the period 2001/02  -  2023/24, are publicly available in the approved Sydney Airport Master Plan 2003/04 on the Sydney Airport Corporation Limited website: http://www.sydneyairport.com.au.The most recent aircraft actual and forecast movements for Bankstown Airport, which cover the period 1998/99  -  2024/25, are publicly available in the approved Bankstown Airport Master Plan 2004/05 on the Bankstown Airport Limited website: http://www.bankstownairport.com.au.</DOC>

, (b) and (d):Incident 1: On 31 December 2003, a male person was intercepted by Australian Protective Service (APS) Officers near International Departure Gate 33. The male person was not in possession of an airline ticket, passport or outgoing passenger card and appeared to be in an incoherent state. The person was detained by AFP members before being transported to hospital for psychiatric assessment. It was later determined that the person suffered from a mental health condition which required treatment, further assessment and observation. The person was detained under the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW).Incident 2: On 21 April 2004, NSW Department of Fisheries (NSW Fisheries) was patrolling Botany Bay, in the vicinity of the airport, when they observed a small boat with two male occupants and a third male in the water. NSW Fisheries officers suspecting illegal fishing approached the boat and obtained identification details from the occupants. When they attempted to speak to the male in the water, the intercepted boat departed the area. The male in the water attempted to evade NSW Fisheries by hiding in the rocks at the southern end of the runaway and was later observed running on the north/south runway. Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd (SACL) and the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) closed the main north/south runway for approximately forty minutes. During this time two domestic flights were diverted and the arrival of several international flights delayed. NSW Police Air Wing and Dog Squad were called to assist locating the trespasser. A police dog tracked the trespasser who was subsequently detained by the NSW Police Service (NSWPS) and APS officers. Custody of the male was then transferred to the AFP.Incident 3: On 7 July 2004, a male person was prevented from boarding a Qantas aircraft after he claimed he had 'lost all his papers' and needed to leave the terminal. The aircraft was stationed at International Terminal 1, being a restricted area. The person was escorted to the (then) Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) office. He then fled from the sterile area. The person was pursued and detained by AFP and DIMIA officers as he attempted to catch a taxi. The person was later assessed by a Mental Health Crisis Team which determined he was experiencing a psychotic episode. The male person was subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act 1990 and admitted to a psychiatric hospital.Incident 4: On 14 July 2005, a male person breached the perimeter fence line adjacent to Terminal 1 and entered the Security Restricted Area (SRA) of Sydney Airport by cutting the fence line with wire cutters. The person obtained unauthorised access to the apron area, a restricted area of the Airport, for a period of 14 minutes. During that time he was under observation by a number of Qantas employees who contacted the AFP for assistance. He was then arrested by AFP Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR). It was determined the person did not gain unauthorised access to aircraft, (b) and (c) All persons referred to are Australian Nationals. None of these persons were or are employed by a workplace located within the Sydney International Airport.No. The trespassers were not employed by an organisation associated with the Airport.The Australian Customs Service (ACS) advises it has no evidence that any of the trespassers accessed these areas. At the time of each incident, ACS cameras in the basement areas were only utilised to support specific ACS operationsNeither the AFP nor the ACS can confirm if all prohibited areas are covered by CCTV surveillance. SACL is responsible for security monitoring. However, since these incidents, the ACS has expanded its CCTV coverage.Neither the AFP nor the ACS has CCTV footage of any of the four incidents. SACL is responsible for CCTV security monitoring within the airport grounds.The AFP conducted inquiries in regards to all four incidents. Formal charges were laid against two of the trespassers and no further action was taken against the remaining two due to mental health considerations.The ACS assisted the AFP in its investigations into each incident.and (d) The AFP is unable to comment on the actions of other agencies or organisations.The AFP was unable to determine how long the persons involved in Incidents 1 and 3 remained within restricted areas as it was unclear how these persons gained entry in the first instance. With regard to Incident 2, the person remained in a restricted area for about 2 hours prior to detection. With regard to Incident 4, the person remained with the restricted area for about 14 minutes.(b) (c):Incident 1: The person was detected by the APS and its normal incident-reporting procedures were followed.Incident 2: The person was detected by NSW Fisheries and reported to SACL.Incident 3: The person was detected by Qantas personnel and reported to SACL.Incident 4: The person was initially detected by Chubb Security and reported to SACL prior to the person trespassing. However, the person was detected in the Security Restricted area of Sydney Airport by Qantas personnel and reported to SACL.(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)The additional detail you have sought in relation to this question would result in an unreasonable diversion of AFP resources.(11) (a) (b) (c)Incident 1: The AFP received advice from a consulting psychiatrist that the person was not responsible for his actions at the time of the offence, due to the onset of a psychotic episode. No further action will be taken.Incident 2: This person was charged by the AFP with 'trespass on Commonwealth property' and 'endanger safety of a person on a Commonwealth aerodrome'. On 3 August 2004, the person was found guilty on both counts and fined $750 for the first offence. He was convicted and released without sentence on condition he enter self-recognisance to be of good behaviour for 18 months, or face a fine of $500.Incident 3: This person was not charged by the AFP due to his mental health at the time of the offence.Incident 4: This person was charged by the AFP with one count of 'trespass (Commonwealth land)', one count of 'damage Commonwealth property' and one count of 'resist Commonwealth public official'. All three charges were dealt with by way of 5.20Bq (1) (d) (ii) of the Crimes Act 1914, concerning offenders with mental illness and/or intellectual disability. The person was then admitted to the St Vincent's Hospital for treatment.</DOC>

 On 21 September 2005, a statement was made by a passenger to a private security employee at the Emirates check-in counter. The statement was unclear and ambiguous with words spoken to the effect of either 'I do not have explosives in my bag' or 'I have a bag full of explosives'. The passenger was allowed to proceed through Customs and to board the aircraft. Later, the passenger was asked by Emirates staff to disembark and the AFP was notified. Despite the risk having been assessed as negligible, in the interests of public confidence and at the request of Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL), an AFP Bomb Appraisal Officer conducted a hand search of the luggage and found no hazardous material. The person was subsequently questioned by AFP and denied making any threat.
 On 15 November 2004, a female person entered the Sydney Airport International Terminal after ramming her vehicle into another vehicle outside the terminal. The female was observed to be wearing a black jacket inscribed with the words, 'Don't shot bom'. The female was approached by AFP Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR) officers and instructed to stop. The female stated, 'Get out of my way; I have a job to do'. AFP CTFR officers then obstructed her entry into the terminal. AFP CTFR cordoned, contained and evacuated the immediate area as a precautionary measure and NSW Police were requested to attend. The female removed a black case from under her jacket and placed it on her lap. The black case had words inscribed on it stating 'Don't Shot Bomb' with wires that appeared to lead from the case to her left thumb. NSW Police then attended and commenced negotiations with the female, known to be suffering from a mental illness. She was then searched. No explosives were located on her or inside the black case. The female was transported by NSW Police to hospital for assessment.This incident was confirmed as a hoax.(b) (c)
 The threat was received by a private security guard.
 The threat was observed by AFP CTFR personnel.(b) (c) (d) (e) (f) The additional detail you have sought in relation this question would result in an unreasonable diversion of AFP resources.
Incident 1 was not reported to NSW Police as the incident was resolved by the AFP. A full report of Incident 2, being AFP Protection Incident Report number 838/04 titled 'Bomb Threat/Hoax', was provided to NSW Police on 15 November 2004.Airline operators are responsible for assessing the veracity of the type threat referred to in Incident 1. As an added precaution, an AFP Bomb Appraisal Officer also conducted a hand search of the luggage and found no hazardous material. In the case of Incident 2, the AFP made the initial assessment and treated the threat as credible. The AFP then provided a CTFR capability by cordoning, containing and evacuating the immediate area until NSW Police attended to make further assessment.
Incident 1 was not considered real. Incident 2 was initially assessed as being real. Subsequent assessment deemed the threat to be a hoax.(b) (c) The person involved in Incident 1 was not charged by the AFP as there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The person involved in Incident 2 appeared before the Central Local Court on 19 November 2004 and, pursuant to section 33 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW), was admitted to the care of a mental health facility.</DOC>

 On 4 April 2005, the AFP was advised that a Regional Express (REX) flight scheduled to depart Sydney Airport for Wagga Wagga had been terminated as a result of a male passenger making threats regarding an improvised explosive device (IED). The passenger was charged by the AFP under s 9.01 of the Aviation Transport and Security Regulations 2005, being 'threats regarding aviation security'. The passenger was issued with a Court Attendance Notice and subsequently released by the AFP.Incident 2: On 29 January 2005, a passenger checked-in to board a Virgin Blue flight from Sydney Airport began pacing between rows at the departure gate. He was heard saying 'I'm going to hijack this plane'. The passenger was arrested and charged by the AFP under s 24(2) of the Crimes Aviation Act 1991, which was later amended to section 24(1). The passenger was issued with a Court Attendance Notice and then released.Incident 1: The AFP established the threat to be non- genuine following a conversation with the passenger.Incident 2: A search of this person's personal belongings was conducted by the AFP and no hazardous items were located. As such, the passenger's threats were assessed by the AFP to be non-genuine.</DOC>

The incident occurred on 20 September 2004.The device was composed of a sparkler head, a cardboard tube filled with match heads and a substance suspected of being magnesium. The device was 15-20cm long and approximately 3cm in diameter. The end of the cardboard tubes was sealed with black electrical tape.The device was constructed by a 13 year old juvenile.The device was first loaded on board a Virgin aircraft at Maroochydore Airport.The device was loaded onto a passenger flight.The person found responsible for the device is a member of the public.They have no affiliation with Sydney Airport.The person responsible for placing the device on the aircraft is a 13 year old juvenile.The design of the device was such that it was extremely unlikely to have activated while in the cargo hold and, thus, posed little threat to the safety of passengers or airline employees.The device was located in the aircrafts cargo hold on arrival into Sydney Airport., (b) and (c)The device was initially discovered by a Virgin Airlines representative who reported it to a private security company, contracted to monitor screening points by Sydney Airports Corporation Limited.This information is not held by the AFP.The AFP Counter Terrorism First Response (CTFR) responded to the location of a suspicious item at a screening point. It was established the suspect item was recovered by baggage handlers within the cargo hold of a Virgin flight and transported to the primary screening point for assessment. CTFR Bomb Appraisal Officers examined the item and determined it to be hazardous. Contact was then made with NSW Police Rescue to render the device safe. The device was relocated to an adjacent valet car park area prior to the arrival of NSW Police. This area was cleared and a cordon was established by the AFP. NSW Police Rescue re-examined the device and rendered it safe. A search of the aircraft cargo hold, where the item had been stored for transportation, was conducted by the AFP and NSW Police using explosive detection canines. No hazardous items were detected.(b) (c) The AFP is not responsible for baggage screening at airports and is unable to comment on the actions taken or decisions made by baggage screening personnel.(b) (c) (d) (e) and (f) The AFP is unable to comment on internal reporting requirements of Virgin Blue staff and does not have access Virgin Blue records and/or reports.(b) (c) (d) The AFP is unable to comment on enquiries that may or may not have been conducted in relation to this incident by other agencies. On 24 September 2004, a statement was obtained by the AFP from the juvenile who admitted to making the device and carrying it on board an aircraft in his checked bag luggage. Due to the circumstances and the age of the juvenile, no further action was taken.</DOC>

The Australian Government accepts and agrees with the conclusions of assessments conducted by the US DEA and international organisations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and World Bank that eradicating poppy cultivation in Afghanistan is a long term issue. The Executive Director of the UNDOC, Antonio Maria Costa, in announcing a joint UNODC/World Bank study on Afghanistan's drug industry on 28 November 2006, stated that 'History teaches us that it will be a generation to render Afghanistan opium-free'.The Australian Federal Police (AFP) was approached in early 2006 by British officials involved in developing the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA). Preliminary discussions have been held with the British but no Australian participation in training programs has taken place to date. In response to the British approach the AFP will deploy four officers to Afghanistan around March 2007. Two officers will provide assistance to CNPA officers working in Jalalabad and two officers will provide assistance to the Afghan National Police (ANP), as part of the Combined Security Transition Command in Kabul. Government has approved an initial contribution for a period of two years.The UNODC publication, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2006, states that poppy cultivation in Oruzgan Province in 2006 increased to 9,773 ha.1 In 2005 there was a much lower poppy cultivation of 2,024ha while in 2004 11,080ha of Oruzgan Province was used for poppy cultivation. For 2006 this represents 6% of total poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.The Australian Government will not comment on current or future operational plans for Oruzgan Province.1September 2006, UNODC, Afghanistan Opium Survey 2006, Executive Summary page 4-5</DOC>

1. Parties to this Agreement
The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding (Agreement) are the Commonwealth of Australia (the Commonwealth) and the New South Wales Government (the NSWG).
2. Introduction
The Commonwealth will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) programme of events for 2007 (APEC 2007). APEC is the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2007 programme will encompass a wide range of ministerial, officials' and business meetings and events across Australia that culminate in meetings of APEC economy leaders (AELM), to be held in Sydney, New South Wales on 8  -  9 September 2007. Several of the preceding meetings and events are held in the week leading up to the AELM and are collectively referred to as the APEC Leaders' Week.The purpose of this Agreement is to identify the organisational and administrative arrangements associated with holding the APEC Leaders' Week in Sydney including services and obligations to apply for the term of the Agreement. This Agreement only relates to coordination of events associated with the facilitation of the APEC-related events in the APEC Leaders' Week. A list of scheduled APEC meetings and events, that comprise the APEC Leaders' Week are at Attachment A.
3. Aims
facilitate bilateral and multilateral outcomes that are in Australia's national interest,be secure,have a distinctive Australian style and effectively showcase Australia and Australia's business community,be involving and acceptable to the wider community,minimise disruption to the general public, andenhance Australia's international reputation to be able to deliver complex, high security international events.
4. Guiding Statements
that the Commonwealth, and specifically the Prime Minister, is the sole host of the APEC year and the APEC Leaders' Week.that in order to deliver a successful APEC Leaders' Week, an effective and cooperative relationship between the governments is vital.in accordance with Constitutional conventions, as well as extant law enforcement and security frameworks such as the National Counter Terrorism Plan (NCTP), the NSW Police (NSWP) is responsible for operational security of APEC events held in NSW.Australia's international standing and profile will be enhanced by a successful APEC Leaders' Week.
5. Term of the Agreement
This Agreement covers the period from the date of signature to the conclusion of all activities associated with the APEC Leaders' Week.
6. Commonwealth Security Support to New South Wales
The Commonwealth recognises that the size and complexity of the APEC Leaders' Week will generate demands on security resources above and beyond that normally encountered for government events and that the NSWG has finite capability in these areas. Accordingly, the Commonwealth agrees to make available Commonwealth assets and other resources including but not limited to commercial security contractors, appropriate elements of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Australian Federal Police to secure the APEC Leaders' Week.Calls on Commonwealth assets and other resources to complement the APEC security overlay, identified during APEC Leaders' Week security planning, will be endorsed by the APEC Leaders' Week Executive Management Committee (AEMC) prior to any request for such assets being made to the Commonwealth. These processes do not replace or alter any Commonwealth  -  State relationship under the NCTP or any ADF deployment under the Plan.
7. APEC Related Cost Framework
Security Costs
The governments acknowledge that at the time of signing security planning was at a relatively early stage resulting in specific requirements and costs not being clearly defined.The Commonwealth, while noting that constitutional responsibility for the maintenance of law and order within the State of New South Wales including the protection of life and property rests with the NSWG, will cover those APEC specific security costs, provided such costs are agreed by the Commonwealth and the NSWG to be APEC-specific. This will include costs incurred in preparation for APEC Leaders' Week, operational costs at event time as well as post-event matters directly related to the event.Security for APEC 2007 and the Leaders' Week means provision of planning and the policing related response for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of life and property. Security will be conducted in coordination with APEC 2007 Taskforce resources. The conduct of activities will be executed with APEC 2007 Taskforce resources, NSWP or other response organisations. The general areas of security include but are not limited to traffic and transport, intelligence, emergency response, personal safety, public order, tactical response, dignitary protection and venue related protection.The APEC 2007 Police Command will work closely with the Commonwealth APEC 2007 Taskforce and the PSCC to identify the security arrangements for the APEC Leaders' Week under the current security environment.The development and management of a detailed security framework for the APEC Leaders' Week is the responsibility of the APEC Leaders' Week Security Operations Group (ASOG) as defined under the governance section of this Agreement. The ASOG will develop an APEC Security Operational Agreement (ASOA). The roles and responsibilities of the ASOG are outlined at Attachment E.
Non-Security Costs
The Commonwealth also recognises that there will be other APEC-specific costs, not directly related to the APEC security overlay. Subject to the governments agreeing on these other APEC-specific non-security costs, the Commonwealth agrees to meet these costs. Such costs could include, but are not limited to, medical and emergency services, public outreach programmes, unusual utilities required for APEC activities and costs related to adjusting public works schedules that ensure disruptive projects do not impinge on APEC activities.The governments agree that the responsibility for meeting the costs of provision of non-security related services by NSWG instrumentalities will be dealt with through an APEC Operational Agreement (AOA) to be developed and managed by the APEC Leaders' Week Operations Group (AOG). Arrangements for the provision of these services and cost recovery arrangements will be detailed in the AOA.
Financial Agreement Schedule
All payments by the Commonwealth will be in accordance with the agreed payment schedules developed as part of the ASOA and AOA. The operational groups (the ASOG and AOG) will identify financial milestones that will form the basis of these financial schedules to be submitted for endorsement by the AEMC. Release of funds for an activity may be deferred until agreed actions for that activity have been completed to the satisfaction of the AEMC.
8. Contract Negotiations and Compensation
Contract Negotiations
Arrangements between the APEC Taskforce and APEC 2007 venues such as the Sydney Opera House (SOH) and the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre (SCEC) will be subject to commercial negotiations between the Taskforce and the venues.It is noted that some NSW venues the Taskforce will hire may be heritage listed or significant NSW icons such as Government House and the SOH, therefore the Taskforce will seek advice and consult with appropriate NSW representatives regarding their use.
Compensation to Corporate Entities
The Commonwealth, while recognising that APEC Leaders' Week activities may cause a level of disruption to some business entities, aims to minimise the range and magnitude of this disruption.The Commonwealth assesses that any disruption to normal levels of activity of business entities located in or near APEC events may be offset by patronage from APEC accredited delegates and by contracts to the Commonwealth, as represented by the APEC 2007 Taskforce in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) for the provision of services to the APEC Leaders' Week.
Cancellation Compensation
In the event that the Commonwealth is forced to cancel the APEC Leaders' Week in Sydney, the Commonwealth accepts that it may in some circumstances be liable to provide compensation to the NSWG. Any such compensation claims should be raised using the dispute resolution framework outlined in this Agreement.
9. State and Territory Government Access to APEC Events
promotional opportunities at some venues including the SCEC and the SOH,elements of the Chief Executive Officers' Summit,elements of the APEC Business Advisory Council forum, andthe Official Leaders' Dinner.
10. Commonwealth and State Legislative Amendments
The governments realise that there may be some requirement for short term legislative amendments at both the state and Commonwealth level in order to ensure that APEC specific operations can occur. Any requirements for legislative changes will be identified by the operational groups (ASOG and AOG) and endorsed by the AEMC before being forwarded to the respective government for consideration.
11. Governance
The governments agree to establish a governance framework that seeks to ensure that structures and processes are in place to maximise performance and meet accountability requirements. The governance framework will cover strategic, operational and tactical level elements of planning for and delivery of the APEC Leaders' Week. The governments agree to establish organisational groups which form the key components of the APEC planning and decision-making process as described below and interact as illustrated in Attachment B.

Australian - based Antarctic tourism operators are required to obtain an authorisation for Antarctic activities under the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 (ATEP Act) and the activity must be carried out in accordance with this authorisation. Authorisations may only be issued after an environmental impact assessment has been carried out by the tourism operator on the proposed activities. In addition, a permit under the ATEP Act is required for certain activities, including entry to some protected areas.The Department of the Environment and Water Resources regularly consults with Australian - based Antarctic tourism operators and seeks to ensure that all those planning Antarctic activities are aware of and comply with the requirements of the ATEP Act. The Department investigates any reports of activities that may have been conducted in contravention of the ATEP Act.As far as it is known, all current Australian - based Antarctic tour operators obtain appropriate authorisations and permits for their Antarctic activities and conduct their activities in compliance with these instruments.The environmental requirements for Antarctic tourism activities are derived from the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection. Australia monitors the development of Antarctic tourism and will continue to work with other Antarctic Treaty member countries to ensure that the environmental requirements for Antarctic tourism are adequate.</DOC>

The Australian Government supports international cooperation against transnational crime and corruption, including through encouraging Asia-Pacific countries to become parties to the UNCAC. Australia provided $300,000 for the joint Australia-UN Office of Drugs and Crime-Thailand Workshop (Bangkok, January 2006) to promote UNCAC ratification. Nine Asia-Pacific countries participated in this Workshop: Australia, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Since the Workshop, China and Indonesia have ratified the UNCAC. Of the nine countries mentioned, only Fiji and Mongolia have yet to sign the UNCAC.Australia is a member of the Asia Development Bank - OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for the Asia-Pacific and provides financial support to the Initiative. There are currently 27 members of the Initiative: Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Cook Islands, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, ROK, Macao, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vanuatu and Vietnam. Australia has also promoted UNCAC through the APEC Anti-corruption and Transparency Experts Task Force and the Conferences of Parties for United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and United Nations Convention against Corruption.</DOC>

The November meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) did not consider, nor did the Australian representative take any position on, any proposal to remove the names of individual donors from the OECD published survey of donor performance. The meeting did however, discuss how information on individual donor performance is to be presented in future with this issue being referred to the December Senior Level Meeting (SLM) for consideration.The 7 December OECD Global Forum (GF) on Development did not consider any proposal to remove individual donor country names from the OECD published survey on donor performance. The 6 December OECD SLM did however, consider three options for presenting data on individual donor performance for inclusion in the 2006 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration. While none of the options considered proposed removing individual donor identification the Australian position was that option C (donor results by indicator) was the most appropriate in terms of monitoring Paris Declaration commitments.Yes.</DOC>

For each year since 2001, no person in immigration custody has died during either removal or deportation from Australia.The answer refers to both removals and deportations because the deportation power is no longer widely used. Most enforced departures from Australia occur under section 198 of the Migration Act which requires that unlawful non-citizens be removed as soon as practicable. A deportation order may be issued against a non-citizen under s200 on security grounds or because they have been convicted of serious criminal offences.</DOC>

Yes.The Government does not support the motion's call for the UN to sponsor an international convention on suicide terrorism and seeks to disallow the motion moved for reasons outlined as follows.First, the Australian Government does not see the benefit in initiating an International Convention on Suicide Terrorism, since there are already 13 existing international conventions on terrorism that cover all types of terrorist acts and behaviours. The Government has a long-standing policy of seeking a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism though negotiations with United Nations member states. It supports a comprehensive instrument on terrorism, rather than seeking separate conventions on specific forms like suicide bombings, additional to those that already exist.Second, current offences defined in the Criminal Code already capture all types of terrorist activity, making it unnecessary to create a separate offence of suicide terrorism either in domestic or international law. There are also practical constraints, such as difficulties the prosecution would face in identifying the perpetrators remaining after a suicide terrorist attack. The definition of a terrorist act in the Criminal Code makes it an offence to engage in, train for, prepare, plan, finance or otherwise support terrorist activities. In its June 2006 report, the Security Legislation Review Committee approved the Criminal Code's definition of a terrorist act.Third, the Government's policy is to focus on strong intelligence and security measures, as well as other strategies to prevent terrorism, including suicide attacks. Prevention strategies include working closely with mainstream Muslim communities in Australia and overseas to reject notions that such actions are either heroic or supported by religious doctrines. I (Mr Downer) emphasised the need to address terrorist ideology and propaganda in my address to the seminar convened by the Indonesian Government in February 2006, 'International Cooperation Against Terrorism: Focusing on Suicide Bombing as a Symptom of Terrorism.'
Fourth, the Government considers that suicide terrorism may already be considered a crime against humanity, both at the international level where the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction and under Australia's domestic law. Crimes against humanity are defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Government legislated in 2002 to make crimes against humanity an offence under the Commonwealth Criminal Code.Australia has been contributing to progress on the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) through constructive and active engagement in the Ad Hoc Committee's negotiations on the text through our Mission to the United Nations in New York. The Government has strongly supported the adoption of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the most comprehensive CT statement ever adopted by the General Assembly.We have sought to move CCIT negotiations forward in New York through coordinated and combined efforts with other countries to build consensus. These countries include the CANZ sub-grouping (Canada, Australia and New Zealand), as well as other like-minded countries on this issue. In statements with CANZ, Australia has urged States to redouble their efforts to conclude the CCIT and demonstrate unambiguous commitment to criminalise all terrorist acts, and cooperate in the prosecution of those responsible for such acts.We have also engaged in advocacy on a bilateral basis with a range of other countries, urging them to support the conclusion of the CCIT negotiations.In the 2006-07 budget, the Australian Government committed $92.3 million in regional CT assistance over the next four years, including to capacity-building in law and justice sectors to help countries comply with, and ratify international CT conventions.</DOC>

I am aware of the report.Yes. The information in (b) below reflects advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and AusAID.The Government is concerned by the allegations of human rights abuses contained in the report, many of which involve police intimidation and assault on communities in logging areas. Australia has been seeking to encourage and assist the PNG Government to reform the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), in order to improve the law and order situation in the country and address a range of problems within the RPNGC, including indiscipline, violence and corruption.Assistance to the RPNGC was a key focus of the Enhanced Cooperation Program established by the two governments in 2004, until the PNG Supreme Court ruled in May 2005 that aspects of the program were unconstitutional. The Australian Government has since offered to provide a number of Australian police as advisers to the RPNGC to assist its reform.The ACF report also refers to the abuse of women in logging areas. The Government is concerned about violence against women in Papua New Guinea, which extends well beyond the forestry sector. The Australian Government, through programs conducted by AusAID, has provided support for the justice system, including village courts, to deal with family and sexual violence, and funded community initiatives to raise awareness and support victims of sexual violence. We have also supported local organisations, such as the Family and Sexual Violence Action Committee, which played an important role in encouraging legislative changes in Papua New Guinea to protect women from sexual violence.The ACF report raises allegations of poor governance and unsustainable practices in PNG's forestry sector. The Australian Government takes these allegations seriously and has called for the Papua New Guinea Government to ensure that relevant legislation and procedures are enforced, including those pertaining to environmental and landowner protection. Australia is strongly committed to sustainable forest management. We have sought to improve the capacity of the Papua New Guinea Government to tackle these problems by funding four advisers in Papua New Guinea's National Forest Authority to strengthen the agency's corporate governance and financial accountability functions. The Australian Government is also supporting the development of a sustainable forest industry in Papua New Guinea by providing funding for forestry projects sponsored by the International Tropical Timber Organization. Discussions are continuing between PNG and Australia on possible further support to the National Forest Authority.</DOC>

The detailed data has not been collected by my department. However, information that is provided publicly by petrol retailers indicate that the number of service stations selling biofuels has been increasing rapidly in recent years.The number of service stations selling unleaded petrol blended with 5 or 10 per cent ethanol (E5 and E10 respectively) in June 2005 was approximately 70. By mid - September 2006 this had increased to around 395; and by the end of January this year the number of service stations selling E5 and E10 had increased to about 525.There is limited information available regarding the number of service stations providing biodiesel and the total number of service stations selling biodiesel is not available. However, Caltex announced in October 2006 that they are in process of rolling out their New Generation Diesel that contains 2 per cent biodiesel to 185 service stations in NSW.With the introduction of the $17.2 million Ethanol Distribution Program the number of service stations selling ethanol blended fuels should increase over the course of the year.The number of service stations selling liquefied petrol gas (LPG) is approximately 3,200.The volume of biofuels sold through individual service stations is not available for the time period requested.The volume of LPG sold from retail outlets since 2000 to 30 November 2006 is:

While the Australian Government will continue to support the United Nations Millennium Project goal of 0.7 per cent of GNI as an aspiration, it does not support a time bound target to reach this goal. The Government is committed to increasing Australia's official development assistance (ODA) to around $4 billion per annum by 2010.</DOC>

Yes, the Department of Health and Ageing is leading a Council of Australian Governments trial in the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Yakunyatjatjara Lands. The Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy and associated regulations were developed on the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Yakunyatjatjara Lands following a decision by the Anangu Pitjanjatjara Executive. The Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy has the endorsement of both the Commonwealth and the South Australian governments. It is guided by a comprehensive plan that addresses the issue of food security, food access (including affordability) and food availability (including range and quality). Activities are carried out by the Mai Wiru Stores steering committee under the auspice of the Nganampa Health Council.Yes. The provision of affordable healthy food is covered under a Memorandum of Understanding with all community councils.It provides for:Mai Wiru policy and regulations were developed in 2000-2001. Implementation of the policy has occurred since 2002. Preferred supplier agreements were signed in April 2006 which allow for rebates based on volume and a flat freight rate across the lands., and (6). No. There are several factors that influence the price of goods in the stores.Historically there have been no store budgets. For the 2006 - 07 financial years budgets have been prepared for each store with the intention of determining the true cost structures and the running costs of the individual stores. This will assist in determining where price reductions can occur without impacting adversely on the viability of the store.Some stores have been servicing a debt that usually involves a price rise.</DOC>

Mr Peter Foster was most recently issued with an Australian passport on 31 July 2003. His passport was cancelled on 5 February 2007 and he was granted a limited validity travel document to facilitate his return to Australia. That document was impounded on arrival in Australia.An Australian citizen is entitled to be issued with an Australian passport subject to the requirements of the Australian Passports Act 2005. The Act provides for a competent authority to request that a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant issued in Australia for an indictable offence or who is prevented from travelling internationally by force of a court order, parole or bail condition or direction under a law of the Commonwealth, should be refused issue of an Australian passport.According to passport records, Mr Foster was not subject to any legal restraint that would have prevented issue of a passport under the passport legislation in force at that time (Passports Act 1938).The Australian Passports Act 2005 provides the Minister with the power to cancel and/or refuse to issue a passport to a person at the request of a 'competent authority' which suspects on reasonable grounds that a) the person is the subject of an arrest warrant issued in a foreign country in respect of a serious foreign offence, or b) the person is prevented from travelling internationally in connection with a serious foreign offence, or c) the person would be likely to engage in conduct that might prejudice security or endanger the health or physical safety of other persons in Australia or overseas.</DOC>

Australia has provided extensive counter-terrorism (CT) assistance and advice to partners in Asia and the Pacific, with an emphasis on those facing the greatest terrorist threat and those least equipped to address it. Australia has established a network of bilateral CT cooperation arrangements that underpin and facilitate practical, operational-level cooperation in countering terrorism with regional partners. CT Cooperation Memoranda of Understanding have been concluded with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, East Timor, PNG and Fiji. Most assistance and advice is provided under bilateral programs. Some is provided to regional or sub-regional groups of countries, such as ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum.Assistance and advice has been provided to our partners in a wide range of areas, including law enforcement; border control; transport security (including protecting aviation against Man-Portable Air Defence Systems); CT legal frameworks; intelligence; terrorist financing; defence; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear terrorism; and strengthening of national CT coordination arrangements. The assistance takes many forms, including, where appropriate in each case, training, technical assistance, exchange of information, expert advice, provision of equipment, seminars/conferences and the conduct of CT response exercises. For further information on Australia's offshore CT engagement see the recent Government publication Protecting Australia Against Terrorism (www. pmc.gov.au/publications/protecting_australia_2006/index.htm).Australia and Indonesia are leading Southeast Asian CT efforts through a regional CT ministerial meeting process. An important mechanism for providing practical assistance is the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation  -  also an Australia-Indonesia initiative  -  which is building the expertise and professionalism of regional law enforcement agencies, with around 85 courses conducted so far for more than 1900 regional participants. The Philippines is an increasingly important CT partner, with cooperation focused on law enforcement, port security, border management and defence issues.Funding arrangements for CT assistance to the region are as set out in DFAT's Portfolio Budget Statements and those of other relevant agencies.</DOC>

Ministers and high-ranking officials from many NATO-ISAF mission nations attended the Munich Conference. I will continue to encourage NATO members to take such action.

Yes.In December 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair in a press conference during his visit to Ankara, underlined the strategic importance of Turkey to the EU, particularly in relation to the situation in the Middle East. He said Turkey's EU membership was not just important to Turkey, but to the future of Europe. Other countries supporting consistently Turkey's EU ambitions include Sweden, Italy and Spain.While not rejecting such a prospect out of hand, France, along with Austria, has pledged to hold a referendum on Turkey's EU accession. German Chancellor Merkel has also talked about a possible privileged partnership for Turkey rather than full membership.</DOC>

Yes I am aware of the report. RAMSI continues to do very good work in maintaining security in Solomon Islands and in helping to equip Solomon Islands overcome the many difficulties the country faces. The political environment is challenging, but the Australian Government is working hard to keep RAMSI in place and effective.Australia remains committed to Solomon Islands through both RAMSI and bilaterally. We continue to look for ways to engage with the Solomon Islands Government (SIG) in order to deal effectively with issues as they arise, and have urged the SIG to provide an opportunity for our High Commissioner to present his Letter of Introduction, to enable him to carry out his duties.The High Commission in Honiara took the decision to buy space to ensure the letter was printed in full. I understand this is the first time that space has been bought for such a purpose in Solomon Islands newspapers.See Attachment A for copy of my letter to the people of Solomon Islands.The letter was published in the Solomon Star, Island Sun, and the National Express newspapers.Total cost was SBD12,003 (approximately AUD 2265.00) for publication in the three newspapers.RAMSI contributing countries were briefed on the letter on the day of publication.It is difficult to gauge public reaction. However, the editorial in the Solomon Star on 9 February 2007 highlighted the need for Solomon Islands and in particular Prime Minister Sogavare, to mend the relationship with Australia.
Attachment A
 1. Whether RAMSI and its partnership with you is to continue and 2. Whether certain units of the Solomon Islands Police Force (SIPF) should be re-armed.Moves by the government to re-arm the SIPF are of very great concern. RAMSI has acknowledged that the SIPF will need to use some arms in the future. But despite what has been achieved so far in building the capacity of the SIPF, it is clear that it is too early yet for such a sensitive step.It appears most Solomon Islanders agree. I understand a recent newspaper poll found that 95 per cent of the many asked were opposed to re-arming. The RAMSI Special Coordinator believes, and we support his judgement, that it would be against RAMSI's mandate to support re-arming in the face of such strong concerns from the people of Solomon Islands.The security of the Solomon Islands Prime Minister is, of course, a very serious matter. RAMSI provided armed close personal protection to Prime Minister Sogavare until he  -  not RAMSI  -  asked for this protection to be removed in late 2006. RAMSI remains ready and willing to assist in meeting the Prime Minister's security needs.Australia has also been watching with some concern as government institutions in Solomon Islands, designed to ensure the government and people are accountable for their actions, have been undermined. The government dismissed the Attorney General, a Solomon Islander, and replaced him with a man wanted in Australia on child-sex charges. Late last year, the Solicitor General, a RAMSI deployee, was forced to leave after being personally threatened. Without giving any reason, the government then banned the Police Commissioner, Shane Castles, from the country.Despite all of this, Australia has attempted to move ahead on the bilateral relationship. We have welcomed to Australia a new Solomon Islands High Commissioner, His Excellency Victor Ngele. We have also appointed a new High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Peter Hooton, who is keen to advance our shared interests. Unfortunately, the Solomon Islands Government has now cancelled two appointments for Mr Hooton to present his letter of introduction, thereby preventing him from carrying out his legitimate duties as Australia's representative to Solomon Islands.Australia has been accused of not respecting the sovereignty of Solomon Islands. In fact the whole reason for RAMSI's existence has been to support and strengthen that sovereignty. Before RAMSI, Solomon Islands' sovereignty had been seized, at the point of a gun, by bands of thugs and criminals. Since then, RAMSI has been working very hard to ensure that the people of Solomon Islands can live their lives in peace and security. We have helped Solomon Islands to build institutions capable of delivering essential services, such as health and education, to the people. These are the basic building blocks of sovereignty.Sovereignty, of course, entails responsibility. Leaders are responsible for ensuring they work for the benefit of their people and for listening to and respecting their people's wishes - this is particularly relevant to the re-arming debate. It is also important that governments play a constructive role in ensuring social and ethnic harmony.Australia wants to continue to help Solomon Islands face the challenges of your nation's future. But we are finding this increasingly difficult due to the obstacles being placed in our path. The coming weeks and months will be a critical time. The decisions that your country is currently considering  -  on RAMSI and the question of re-introducing guns to the police  -  will lay the foundations for the future. I urge Solomon Islanders to consider these issues very carefully, and to go out of your way to encourage your leaders to listen to you, their people, and make wise decisions for the future of your country.God Bless Solomon Islands</DOC>

I have signed no instrument under subsection 9(2) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and I am advised by officers of my Department that, after conducting a search of the Gazette and Federal Register of Legislative Instruments, that one instrument has been made pursuant to subsection 9(2) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act.This instrument was made by former Attorney-General Lionel Bowen on 20 July 1989 and was gazetted in the Special Gazette on 24 July 1989 (Special Gazette S253 24 July 1989). The instrument provides that it is in the interests of the defence of Australia to permit the Government of Papua New Guinea to recruit persons in Australia to serve in or with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force for the purpose of facilitating the use of 4 Iroquois helicopters supplied by the Australian Government. The instrument also provides that the declaration is made subject to the condition that the Government of Papua New Guinea shall not recruit members of the Australian Permanent Naval Forces, the Australian Regular Army, the Regular Army Supplement or the Australian Permanent Air Force.Refer to (1) above.</DOC>

and (3) It is not part of my portfolio responsibility to monitor the methodology adopted by The Lancet, or the collection of health data.I am not in a position to comment upon the standing of individual researchers within their own research community.The following researchers have been named, in varying roles, on proposals approved for funding under the National Competitive Grants Programme administered by the Australian Research Council (ARC): Professor James A Angus, Professor Peter Brooks, Professor Alan Lopez, Professor AJ McMichael, Associate Professor Peter Sainsbury, Associate Professor Mike Toole, and Professor Anthony Zwi.See answer to (4).It is not part of my portfolio responsibility to monitor the methodology adopted by The Lancet, or the collection of health data.The ARC, which falls under the education, science and training portfolio, identified in the ARC Strategic Plan 2006-08 one of seven objectives which is to 'contribute to high-quality research training and foster career opportunities for Australia's best and brightest researchers.' This is reflected in one of ten key performance indicators identified in the plan, namely, 'development, attraction and retention of high-quality researchers across disciplines, able to pursue careers within universities, industry, government and other sectors of the economy.'Another of the ARC's objectives identified in the ARC Strategic Plan 2006-08 is to 'encourage and extend cooperative approaches to research and improve the use of research outcomes by strengthening links within Australia's innovation system and with innovation systems internationally.' This is reflected in the key performance indicator, 'a high incidence of collaboration between ARC-funded researchers and those within other sectors of the national and international innovation system, including innovative companies.'The Department of Education, Science and Training also recognises the importance of strong national and international linkages in achieving a high quality research system. The Department's International Science Linkages programme, for example, supports Australian scientists to collaborate with international partners in order to contribute to Australia's economic, social and environmental wellbeing.The Lancet's study has no bearing on the ARC or the Department's strategic priorities.</DOC>

On 20 April 2006, an inbound passenger declared an inert grenade to the Australian Customs Service (ACS) on arrival at Sydney Airport.The inert grenade was originally purchased in Florida, USA.The inert grenade was loaded onto an aircraft from Toronto, Canada.The inert grenade was transported on an international commercial flight that originated from Toronto, Canada, travelling via Los Angeles, to Sydney.The passenger that travelled with the inert grenade is an Australian citizen, who has resided in Canada for the past five years. The passenger was accompanied by his father.The passengers are Australian citizens, travelling on Australian passports.The inert grenade was purchased as a souvenir.The item was purchased from a military disposal store in the USA in 2005.About 7:30am on 20 April 2006 an incoming passenger card was presented to the ACS declaring 'Goods that may be prohibited  -  firearms/weapons'. The ACS located a grenade in the passenger's luggage and contacted the Airport Operations Coordination Centre. The AFP was then called to provide assistance. The grenade was not discovered prior to the arrival of the aircraft into Sydney. The grenade was located within the passengers 'checked bag luggage'.The discovery of the grenade was made by an ACS officer.The Australian Defence Force (ADF) Senior Ammunition Technical Officer conducted an appraisal of the grenade and determined the grenade was inert.The appraisal of the grenade was conducted within the Security Restricted Area (SRA) of Sydney Airport after the aircraft had landed and after the baggage was unloaded.to (g) The additional detail you have sought in relation to this question would result in an unreasonable diversion of AFP resources.On inspection of the passenger's bags by ACS it was established that the bag containing the inert grenade was searched by the Transport Security Administration (TSA) in Los Angles, USA.The box containing the inert grenade remained unwrapped and appeared untouched. Whether or not the grenade was detected is unclear.Neither the AFP nor the ACS is in a position to answer this question.The Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) has raised this event with the United States Transport Security Authority as a screening failure.Prior to departing Canada, the passenger made enquiries with South Australia Police regarding the necessary lawful process of importing the inert grenade into Australia, such as obtaining a 'B709B' form. This information has been confirmed with SA Police. As such, the AFP does not intend to pursue criminal proceedings against the passenger.</DOC>

The trespass occurred on 25 July 2006.The trespasser accessed the Security Restricted Area (SRA) of Sydney Airport.A Qantas catering vehicle was departing the SRA via Gate 7 when two vehicles approached from a public road and entered the airside area of the airport, via the vehicle exit gate.There has been no further report to the AFP of trespass by way of this vehicle exit gate., (b) and (c) This person is an Australian citizen. There is no information to suggest he was or is an airport employee and did not hold an Aviation Security Identification Card (ASIC).It has been confirmed that neither of the two vehicles, nor the four civilians travelling within, had authority to enter the airside area or other restricted areas within the airport.and (5) The Airport operator, Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL), is responsible for the CCTV camera installation and maintenance around the Domestic precinct of Sydney Airport.The AFP Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR) responded to the incident and was notified by the single occupant of the lead vehicle that he was being chased by the three occupants of the second vehicle and feared for his safety. The occupants of the second vehicle stated they were following the first vehicle to obtain identification as a result of a road rage incident. The AFP investigated this matter fully and has recommended prosecution of all individuals involved.The two vehicles were quickly intercepted by Qantas staff on the apron of the Qantas Jet Base. The AFP CTFR members were notified and attended the scene within five minutes.A Qantas security guard detected the initial trespass and immediately notified the SACL airside security patrol who then contacted the AFP.The additional detail you have sought in relation to this question would result in an unreasonable diversion of AFP resources.(a), (b) and (c) All three occupants of the second vehicle were summonsed to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 19 September 2006. All three persons entered a plea of guilty. The driver was convicted under regulations 3.17 (4) of the Aviation Transport and Security Regulations (ATSR) and fined $1000.00. The remaining two occupants of the second vehicle were convicted under regulations 3.17 (2) of the ATSR and fined $1000.00 each. These persons were also ordered to pay court costs. On 3 October 2006, the driver of the lead vehicle entered a plea of not guilty. He failed to appear for subsequent mention hearings and the matter was adjourned until 12 December 2006. On this date he again failed to appear in court and was convicted ex-parte, fined $1500 for driving a vehicle into an airside area without permission of a regulatory officer, contrary to s3.17(4) of the ATSR, and ordered to pay court costs.</DOC>

This has included funding commitments under bilateral agreements on live animal trade (Memoranda of Understanding, MOUs) signed with trading partners in the Middle East. These MOUs ensure animal welfare concerns associated with delays in unloading live animals are mitigated. The projects funded by the International Agricultural Cooperation  -  Live Animal Trade Programme were reported in the DAFF Annual report 2005-06, pages 351 - 352.The Government has engaged an international consultant to undertake a stocktake of feedlot and animal handling facilities in the Middle East region to support Australia's efforts to assess and manage post-arrival animal welfare risks in Middle East countries that import Australian livestock.

Yes, I have read the discussion paper by the Australian Greenhouse Office titled Sulphur Hexafluoride and the Electricity Supply Industry.The Government is aware that sulphur hexafluoride has a high global warming potential and that emissions of sulphur hexafluoride currently contribute around 0.1% to global anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.Australia's emissions of sulphur hexafluoride are calculated by applying an annual leakage rate to an estimated installed capacity. As the size and extent of the electricity supply network remains stable year on year, these assumptions are held constant for the entire time-series. In the years 2001-05 the annual emissions of sulphur hexafluoride were 521,020 CO-equivalents tonnes per year.In FY 2000/01 the Government offered members of the Greenhouse Challenge Programme dollar for dollar funding up to $50,000 for the use of Laser Imaging Cameras (LIC) - possibly through the engagement of an external consultant to undertake a sulphur hexafluoride audit with a LIC to identify leaks.No Challenge members in the electricity transmission industry took up the offer. However, I understand that at least three Australian companies have invested in LIC technology that cost in the order of $250,000. These companies also provide a cost effective leak detection service to other utilities, and many utilities have taken advantage of these services.In addition, the Department of the Environment and Water Resources is currently working with industry to develop best practice guidelines for sulphur hexafluoride management. Australia's principal electricity supply association, the Energy Networks Association, has agreed to take a leading role in this project. The guidelines will address all aspects of sulphur hexafluoride management over the life cycle of the equipment, including emissions monitoring and end of life disposal considerations. This document will ensure that companies approach sulphur hexafluoride management in a consistent manner and will provide a foundation for an ongoing commitment to the achievement of best practice.</DOC>

Any price premium for GM free canola is best identified through a comparison of import prices received for Australian (GM free) canola and Canadian (GM) canola in a key importing country such as Japan. Analysis by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics employing this approach suggests that there has been no consistent premium paid for Australian canola above Canadian canola once transport charges have been taken into consideration.                The comparison of domestic prices in Australia and Canada cannot be relied on as an indicator of price premiums for GM free canola because of a range of other factors influencing the domestic price. These include the availability of domestic oilseeds relative to demand, which in turn is influenced by seasonal conditions.ABARE analysis of price premiums for non - GM canola does not support the contention that the introduction of GM canola will reduce the profitability of Australia's growers. ABARE has concluded that it does not appear that there is a price premium in domestic and world markets for certified non - GM canola that is sufficient to offset the additional costs of segregation.I am aware that Monsanto has conducted trials of its Roundup Ready® GM canola and Bayer CropScience has conducted trials of its Invigor® GM canola in Australia. I understand that the results of these trials indicate that yield and oil content results of the GM varieties exceed non - GM varieties, especially the TT canola. Enquiries on the details of these trials should be addressed to the companies concerned.Shareholding by companies vary from time to time. Enquiries on GrainCorp's shareholdings should be addressed to this publicly listed company.I am aware that Nufarm Ltd issued a Press Release on 6 September 2006 announcing that it had acquired a licence to develop and commercialise Roundup Ready® canola in Australia.The Gene Technology Regulator approved, in 2003, the commercial release of several GM canola events although these are not currently being grown commercially in Australia.Testing methodology and segregation are matters for industry (including GrainCorp Ltd where its operations require) to determine. National labelling laws ensure consumers can make informed choices about their consumption of food ingredients, including GM ingredients.All Australian jurisdictions agreed that existing law was capable of dealing with the contractual arrangements of growing crops, including GM crops. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with funds from the National Biotechnology Strategy has commissioned studies to inform the debate on the use of biotechnology in Australian agriculture. One of these reports addresses liability issues - A farmer's choice? Legal liability of farmers growing crops written by the Australian Centre for Intellectual Property in Agriculture. This and other reports commissioned by DAFF are available on the DAFF agricultural biotechnology website www.daff.gov.au/agbiotechThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR), which is not within my portfolio, was responsible for the GM issues associated with the Cargill consignment. I understand the import licence issued under the Gene Technology Act 2000 for this shipment specified that it be processed so that the seed is no longer viable.</DOC>

Australian Defence College (ADC) Weston Creek was leased under a sale and lease back arrangement of the whole site. The annual rental is not based on a rental per building, but a rental for the whole property. The current annual rent is $2.435 million (excluding GST).In 1993-94, training and office accommodation was completed at ADC for an out-turned cost of $6 million. In 2000-01, Defence managed the contracts for refurbishment and construction of major works at ADC for an outturn cost of $26.3 million (GST exclusive). Current price indexing has been derived using the implicit price-deflator for gross non-farm product, such that in January 2007, $6 million is indexed to $8.2 million, and $26.3 million is indexed to $33.4 million.</DOC>

No. Since August 2006, all Australian Defence Force (ADF) members deploying overseas on operations have received training on incident scene initial action and preservation. This training focuses on what actions any ADF member can take at an incident scene, where the operational circumstances allow, that will secure the scene and preserve any potential evidence at the scene, prior to the arrival of police or inquiry personnel.As a result of the recommendations of the Board of Inquiry into the death of Private Jacob Kovco, the Chief of the Defence Force has directed the Service Chiefs to examine the introduction of similar training at their individual Service induction and/or initial employment courses.The Services are to complete Training Needs Analysis on this requirement by the end of June 2007 and revised training packages are to be implemented at the appropriate training establishments no later than February 2008.</DOC>

The nature of the work that the Australian Government is undertaking to promote healthy eating to Indigenous communities including in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, involves as key components addressing the issues of affordability of and access to, healthy foods and community nutrition education.Details of various programs including funding and timeframes are as follows:The Mai Wiru Regional Stores Project which is funded through the Department of Health and Ageing's Regional Health Services Program. The Mai Wiru (Healthy Food) project aims to develop community stores on the APY Lands that are community owned and that provide access to good quality healthy food for communities. The implementation stage is funded by the Department of Health and Ageing until March 2008. The Australian Government has committed $1,569,590 between 2000 and 2008 to support the Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy.The Child Nutrition Program is funded by the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs as part of the Australian Government's Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. Funding of $1.5 million over 4 years to 30 June 2008 has been provided to the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council Aboriginal Corporation to provide improved child nutrition to Indigenous communities in remote areas of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. This program provides individual case management and support for families where children are identified as at risk, particularly through failure to grow; and nutrition and early childhood education work.The Outback Stores project is funded by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and managed by Indigenous Business Australia. As part of the 2006-07 Commonwealth Budget, Indigenous Business Australia (under the DEWR portfolio) announced an initiative called Outback Stores. This initiative provides $48 million (including $40 million in capital) over 4 years from 1 July 2006. As well as improving the viability and efficiency of remote community stores and increasing employment, the initiative will support stores to provide a better range of goods and services, including healthy foods, at affordable prices.The Remote Indigenous Stores and Takeaway project (RIST), a State/Commonwealth initiative over 3 years from 1 July 2006. This project, Healthy Business, Healthy Food, Healthy Community, is a key component of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nutrition Strategy and Action Plan 2000-2010. It is jointly funded by Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Northern Territory, Western Australia and the Australian Government. The Australian Government has contributed $150,000 to this initiative.These programs operate to address the issues of improved nutrition through affordable and accessible healthy food for Indigenous communities, including in the APY Lands. The programs focus on nutrition education, healthy food provision and preparation. This involves as a key strategy, working through community stores that provide essential services and deliver health and social benefits through adoption of healthy food practices and improvement in the affordability and availability of nutritious foods in remote Indigenous communities. In addition to these initiatives, Indigenous health services take an active role in promoting healthy eating to improve overall health, and prevent and manage chronic disease.</DOC>

The attached treaty analysis prepared by my department indicates that as at 8 March 2007 there are fifty three treaties that Australia has signed which have not entered into force for Australia. The analysis indicates the year and title of each of the thirty seven bilateral treaties in this category signed by Australia. It also indicates the year and title of the sixteen multilateral treaties Australia has signed but which have not so far entered into force.In respect of the treaties identified in Part (1), information on the particular reason in each case for the treaty not entering into force is either unavailable or, if it exists, the time and staff resources required to collect it cannot be justified as it would require unreasonable diversion of resources, in large part because responsibility for bringing the treaties into force lies with departments other than DFAT, including AGD (for extradition and mutual assistance in legal matters treaties), Treasury (for taxation agreements), DOTARS (for air services and IMO agreements) and FACSIA (for social security agreements).In respect of treaties identified in Part (1) for which DFAT has policy carriage  -  the large majority of which have only been signed within the last two years - the primary reasons for their non-entry as yet into force includes: that implementation of Australia's domestic treaty processes and the passage of legislation to implement the treaty is incomplete or delayed; that Australia or the other party to the treaty has withdrawn, denounced, terminated or cancelled the treaty; that the other party to the treaty has not completed its domestic processes for bringing the treaty into force; that there has been further evolution in Australian policy since its signature of the treaty; or, in the case of a multilateral treaty, because the treaty is not in force generally and therefore not in force for Australia.

Australia's trade in food and agricultural products is underpinned by a rigorous food safety and quarantine regime based on scientific food standards designed to protect Australian consumers.All imported food is subject to the same food safety requirements as locally produced food. The main mechanism for managing imported food standards is the Imported Food Program (IFP), which is run jointly by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.FSANZ is responsible for developing food standards for inclusion in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code). AQIS is responsible for the inspection, testing and approval of all imported foods to determine compliance with the Code.The Hon Peter McGauran MP, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has portfolio responsibility for some of the operational aspects of the Code through AQIS. The Hon Christopher Pyne MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health and Ageing has portfolio responsibility for FSANZ matters.</DOC>

No. The honourable member's attention is directed to the Minister's answer to Question 5284, which explains the role of the ACCC in assessing competition issues relating to media mergers and acquisitions.As outlined in the Government's 2004 Election Policy document, 21st Century Broadcasting, the Government's opinion is that current arrangements with the three existing commercial television licences in major markets appear to be working well in delivering quality free-to-air television to Australians. The Government also believes that the issuing of commercial television licences has historically been a matter for the government of the day. Therefore, as part of the recent package of media reforms, power to issue a fourth commercial television licence has been vested in the government of the day.Section 96 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 enables ACMA to issue subscription television broadcasting licences. There is no regulatory inhibition to new subscription television operators entering the Australian market.</DOC>

Mr Mackerras has been wrong in the past and is likely to be so in the future. The recommendations supported by the Government have been implemented in the interests of all Australians who want a fair and honest electoral system.No. Not applicable.I reject the comments. Every eligible Australian retains their right to vote. Indeed it remains their legal and civic responsibility to do so.Yes. But the problem lies not in the rigour of the assessment process but in the limited statutory timeframe for removing fraudulent voters from the rolls. The investigation and removal process is such that even if suspicious activity were detected, it is highly unlikely that a fraudulent enrolment could be excised from the roll of eligible voters in time before the election.In relation to the substance of the allegation that there has been minimal evidence of fraud, I would remind Mr Danby of rorts perpetrated by Mr Mike Kaiser, the disgraced Labor roll-rorter who was forced to resign from the Queensland Parliament, or Ms Karen Erhmann, a Queensland State ALP candidate who went to gaol for electoral fraud. I would remind him of Mr Christian Zahra's own false enrolment when he was not an Australian citizen. I would remind him of the roll rorts committed by a former Labor staffer of Mr Colin Hollis. And I would remind him of cases such as Curacao Fischer Cat, the pet cat that was enrolled in the NSW seat of Macquarie, and Giddy Goanna, a reptile that was enrolled in the seat of Groom. These are all actual, proven cases of serious electoral fraud.Both the Labor Party and Professors Hughes and Costar continually choose to ignore these proven cases of fraud, or they choose to treat them as insignificant. The Government views the position taken by the ALP, and the academics upon whose views they rely so heavily, as nothing short of complacent. Roll rorting, no matter where or how it is perpetrated, will always undermine the integrity of our electoral system. These proven cases of fraud show vulnerability in our system, and rather than turning a blind eye, which is the preferred response of the ALP, Professor Hughes and Professor Costar, the Government is addressing these vulnerabilities through these reforms.No. (b) Yes. There will be no disenfranchisement as long as people follow the law.</DOC>

The Australian Government Antarctic Division accounts do not distinguish in detail the break up of costs specifically for Macquarie Island. The direct operating cost to the Australian Government Antarctic Division of the Macquarie Island station is in the order of $2.7 million per annum in 2006/07 dollars. These costs include supporting the activities of the Bureau of Meteorology.The direct operating cost to the Bureau of Meteorology of the Macquarie Island station is in the order of $700 000 per annum in 2006/07 dollars.Research undertaken on Macquarie Island by scientists from the Australian Government Antarctic Division and collaboratively with scientists from Australian and overseas universities has concentrated on biology and geosciences.Biological research into the breeding biology and life history of southern elephant seals, Antarctic and sub-Antarctic fur seals and leopard seals have contributed valuable knowledge on the status of populations of these species.Research into the flora of the island has revealed the first recorded incidence of a pathogenic plant virus on a sub-Antarctic island, indicating that these remote and distant locations are vulnerable to the same pressures which affect more temperate latitudes. On-going studies on climatic changes on the island are revealing subtle changes to the flowering period of several species of plants.Geologists have examined the structure of the ocean crust, because Macquarie Island is one of the only locations in the world where ocean floor can be studied with relative ease, as Macquarie Island is made up of part of the ocean floor which has been pushed to the surface of the ocean by geological processes.Research into the treatment of soil contaminated with hydrocarbons has revealed how such pollution can be cleaned up in cold climates. Collaborative studies with Canadian researchers indicates that this research has widespread relevance to contamination in other parts of the world.Bureau of Meteorology research activities include routine synoptic weather observations, both automatic and manual.The profile and total atmospheric column of ozone are measured as are various atmospheric constituents such as radon and cloud condensation nuclei. Trace gases are also monitored, particularly those implicated in the major environmental issues of global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Carbon-14 monitoring is also used to track the sources and sinks of CO2.These data add to world weather observations used for weather forecasting and modelling, and to the world climate data record.</DOC>

Yes. However, the figures you quoted are for the seven days between the issue of the writs and the close of the rolls  -  not five days from the announcement of the election to the close of the rolls.The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has advised that there have been no prosecutions for enrolment fraud for the 2004-05 financial year.The Government is committed to ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and considers that the earlier close of rolls period will remove a vulnerability in the electoral system and will provide the AEC with extra time to identify and discount fraudulent enrolments.The electoral rolls will not close on the day the election is announced. The rolls will close on the day the writs are issued for new enrolments and for people who are re - enrolling. The rolls will close on the third working day after the writs have been issued for the following people:those who are already enrolled but who need to change their enrolment details;residents who will be granted Australian citizenship in the period between the day on which the writs are issued and polling day; andyoung people aged 17 years who will turn 18 years of age between the day on which the writs are issued and polling day.The Government does not accept that 380,000 people would not be able to vote as a consequence of the earlier close of rolls. The Government's reasons for changing the close of rolls period were canvassed during the debate of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Act 2006 in the Parliament in 2006. I refer the honourable member to my answer to the House of Representatives Question on Notice 2605 asked on 9 November 2005 and to my comments during debate on 11 May 2006 of proposed amendments to the close of rolls period (Hansard, 11 May 2006, pages 11 to 12 refer).</DOC>

The Tourism Australia Uniquely Australian Invitation campaign with the tag line 'So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?' was launched in Sydney on Thursday 23 February 2006.The number of visits to the website vary from month to month and from day to day and also vary depending on the season, like most travel websites. It is therefore possible to derive different figures of usage depending on the time periods chosen for comparative purposes and difficult to provide an 'average' figure. Therefore, the number of visits over a twelve month period is provided. For the twelve month period for 1/2/2005 to 31/1/2006 there were approximately 5.9 million visits to the Tourism Australia consumer site, Australia.com.In the twelve month period 1/2/2006 until 31/1/2007 there were 6.9 million visits to Australia.com. In addition, there were also 1.5 million visits to the dedicated campaign website, www.sowherethebloodyhellareyou.com in this period.

Agencies generally invoice a sum total, rather than an itemised account, which is then entered into the financial system under relevant general ledger codes. This prevents the Department from being able to distinguish between salary and administration costs paid to recruitment agencies. At this time a breakdown of all individual invoices would entail the allocation of substantial Departmental resources as well as time.</DOC>

This building is due for completion by 30 June 2007.The Department is also engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance and Administration regarding the construction of new premises for the Department in Barton. It is expected that these premises would be leased by the Department and would meet all of the Department's Canberra office accommodation requirements. The project is at an early conceptual stage and the premises would not be completed until 2011 at the earliest.</DOC>

Yes. My Department commissioned modelling in respect to the risk posed by the cumulative effect of wind energy installations on a number of nationally threatened and migratory bird species, including the Swift Parrot, Orange-bellied Parrot, Tasmanian Wedge-tailed Eagle, White-bellied Sea Eagle and other migratory birds. The results of that modelling are presented in a report titled Wind farm collision risk for birds: Cumulative risks for threatened and migratory species. The modelling was undertaken by Biosis Research Pty Ltd and finalised in February 2006. This report is currently available as a hard copy on request from the Department or can be found at:http://www.deh.gov.au/epbc/publications/index.htmlYes. All projects that are determined to be controlled actions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) undergo an assessment and approval process as set out in the Act.Three wind farms have been approved under the Act  -  Portland in Victoria, and Woolnorth and Musselroe in Tasmania. The potential impacts of these installations on flora and fauna, including on threatened birds, was assessed on the best available information at the time.Mortality risk modelling for Orange-bellied Parrots was undertaken by Biosis Research Pty Ltd in 2001/2002 as part of the assessment of the proposed Portland Wind Energy Installation. Using the ecologically reasonable scenario recommended by Biosis, the modelling predicted that between 0.0117 to 0.137 birds per year could be killed. To date, there have been no reports of post-construction mortalities of listed species at the site.Yes. The proposal to construct the Bald Hills Wind Energy Installation was assessed by the Victorian Government under a bilateral agreement with the Australian Government which is provided for under the EPBC Act. An Environment Effects Statement (EES) was prepared and assessed in accordance with the Victorian Government's Environment Effects Act 1978.During the EES process the Victorian Government's Department of Sustainability and Environment made the following comment: 'The Bald Hills wind farm proposal will increase the level of threat to the Orange-bellied Parrot_ A conservative approach is therefore required which acknowledges that this proposed development will increase the cumulative risk to the species posed by the wind farm industry.'The Panel was established to assess the project under the Environment Effects Act 1978 was satisfied that the project would not materially harm the Orange-bellied Parrot.Also see answer to Question (1).The distribution of Orange-bellied Parrots in Australia, including Victoria, is contained within the draft Orange-bellied Parrot Recovery Plan. The Orange-bellied Parrot Recovery Team supplied detailed demographic data for the entire known Australian population of Orange-bellied Parrots to Biosis Research Pty Ltd so they could undertake the modelling for the report cited in Question (1).On 21 December 2006 the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator the Hon Ian Campbell, approved the Bald Hills wind farm, with conditions. The conditions were designed to take into account any impact on the Orange-bellied Parrot while allowing for ecologically sustainable development.A draft Orange-bellied Parrot Recovery Plan was presented to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee in November 2006 for its consideration.The supporting information for the draft Recovery plan lists the following potential threats (in no particular order) to the Orange-bellied Parrot:a. Biology and ecology relevant to threatening processes;b. Degradation and loss of habitat;c. Invasive weeds;d. Introduced predators and competitors;e. Wind farms;f. Psittacine Circoviral Disease;g. Illuminated boats and structures; andh. Trapping (historical).The former Minister approved the Bald Hills wind farm on 21 December 2006.</DOC>

Based on advice from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), I can inform the honourable member that ARPANSA has set a public health standard for exposure to electromagnetic energy (EME). ACMA has adopted the limits of this standard in its regulation of public exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and mobile phone towers. Advice from ARPANSA is that the weight of national and international scientific opinion is that there is no substantiated evidence that EME emissions associated with living or working near a mobile phone base-station pose a health risk.ARPANSA monitors the World Health Organization (WHO) reviews of EME studies and WHO's current advice is that none of the recent reviews have concluded that exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and their base-stations cause any adverse health effects.ARPANSA is currently initiating a mobile phone base-station audit program. It is expected that up to 12 sites will be audited each year. Sites will be selected across all the states. Audits will include the measurement of EME levels from mobile phone base-stations at sites where there is particular public concern.Individuals in Australia who believe they have suffered ill-effects as a result of exposure to EME can lodge a written complaint with ARPANSA to be put on the Electromagnetic Complaints Register. ARPANSA will protect the privacy of complaints.The Government provides $1 million each year to the Health and Ageing portfolio, from a levy on radiocommunication licences, for research into public health effects of EME emissions from radiocommunication devices, including mobile phones, and for a public education program.ACMA and ARPANSA have made available a Mobile Phone Towers and EME Information Pack to further address community concerns about EME. The pack contains fact sheets on EME, deployment of mobile phone towers, mobile phone handsets and associated health issues, and information for rural communities on telecommunications facilities.</DOC>

Development of the new Child Care Quality Assurance (CCQA) system is not complete and my department is consulting with the sector on changes to the quality assurance indicators. However, it is intended that the current three different sets of indicators for long day care, family day care and outside school hours care will be replaced with a primary set of indicators that can be applied to all service types.The NCAC is transitioning from a system of using peer validators to one of employing validators as members of NCAC staff. As at 1 April 2007, the NCAC had employed 36 staff validators. The process of recruitment is continuing and the NCAC will progressively phase out the use of peer validators once the pool of staff validators has reached a sustainable level. While NCAC continues to recruit staff validators, there are approximately 279 peer validators that continue to conduct unannounced Validation Visits on behalf of NCAC.The 36 staff validators employed by the NCAC were contracted as staff validators after 18 May 2006.For the period 1 July 2006 to 31 March 2007 there have been 1 397 validation visits for long day care centres, 1 067 for outside school hours care services and 88 for family day care services.Quality Assurance Spot Checks commenced in November 2006 with all accredited child care services being notified that they should expect a QA Spot Check at any time. The NCAC is currently training validators on Spot Check procedures and is in the process of amending the NCAC database to enable full implementation of the Spot Check process and will be accelerating its program of Spot Checks in 2007. Around 100-200 Spot Checks will be undertaken per month.One of the objectives of the new CCQA system is to minimise any regulatory burden on the child care sector that does not contribute to efforts to provide safe, quality care. Not all states and territories have licensing regulations for all types of child care services, but where regulations are in place they may overlap with the CCQA standards. The Australian Government is currently reviewing, in consultation with state and territory governments, whether any of these overlaps constitutes duplication and this will be taken into account in the development of the new CCQA system.</DOC>

The department received a draft report from Professor Saggers in June 2006.The contract with Edith Cowan University was terminated because the contents failed to meet the terms and conditions of the contract. As such, the report was never finalised. It would not be appropriate to release any aspect of incomplete work.Child care services receiving Australian Government funding are required to adhere to the Priority of Access Guidelines when there is a shortage of places to be allocated. There are three categories and within each Indigenous children are given priority. Further details about payments and Indigenous focused programs and services can be found on the FaCSIA website at www.facsia.gov.au.A number of programs run by FaCSIA support a range of Indigenous focused services. Some of these programs include Multifunctional Aboriginal Children's Services (MAC), programs under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, Indigenous JET crèches and Intensive Support Playgroups. Further details about these programs are on the FaCSIA website at www.facsia.gov.au.The 2004 Australian Government Census of Child Care Services shows that there were 11,971 Indigenous children were attending Australian Government supported child care services in 2004.

In response to growing community concern, the Government directed the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to develop service provider rules requiring industry to inform consumers about the financial risks associated with premium rate services and the actions consumers can take to lessen these risks. These service provider rules require the provision of information to consumers of '190' numbers or international premium services, and premium rate mobile services supplied on '19' number ranges and on proprietary networks.The mobile carriage service providers have also developed the self-regulatory Mobile Premium Services Industry Scheme to provide safeguards for mobile premium services users of numbers with a '19' prefix . The Scheme came into force on 29 October 2006 and requires content providers to provide consumers with information about the costs, terms and conditions of using mobile premium services, including how to unsubscribe from subscription services. Under the Scheme consumers are able to protect themselves by requesting that their provider block access to numbers beginning with 19xx; or choosing a mobile plan that does not include access to 19 numbers.The Scheme also provides a formal complaints resolution process, through the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO). The TIO investigates and resolves complaints that consumers have been unable to resolve with their service providers.Messages which contain a commercial offer, advertisement or promotion are covered by the Spam Act 2003 (the Act). The Act applies to commercial electronic messages sent by email, SMS, multimedia messaging and instant messaging. Under the Act, messages which make a commercial offer may only be sent with the consent of the recipient. These messages must also include accurate information to identify the sender and a facility to allow the recipient to opt-out of future commercial electronic messages. ACMA actively enforces the Act in respect of SMS.</DOC>

Senators and Members had an opportunity to contribute to the consultation process for the new Collective Agreement. On 3 November 2005, my predecessor, Senator the Hon Eric Abetz, in Circular 2005/33, advised all Senators and Members that the Members of Parliament Staff (Commonwealth) Certified Agreement 2003-2006 would reach its nominal expiry date on 20 August 2006 and that a Staff Representative Group would again be elected by staff to negotiate a new agreement on behalf of their colleagues. Senator Abetz also advised that the consultation process would seek the views and opinions of staff, prioritise issues raised and communicate views and opinions in discussions with the Department of Finance and Administration.The assertion that a 'large number of Members and Senators are concerned about the potential impact of the proposed agreement upon staff and on the running of their offices' is inconsistent with the very small number of representations received from Senators and Members. Any views put forward were taken into account in the final proposals put to the vote of all staff.I cannot withdraw this offer. A majority of staff covered by the agreement voted for the agreement and received their pay rise on payday 28 December 2006.</DOC>

International checked baggage screening processes and requirements are included as part of the annual auditing undertaken by the Office of Transport Security.The Department of Transport and Regional Services worked closely with those CTFR airports with regular international flights to ensure that airports met the 100 per cent in-line x-raying of international checked baggage required for open-charter and regular public transport operations from 1 January 2006. The formal auditing that has confirmed the ongoing compliance with these requirements were last undertaken as follows:        Adelaide: 5-8 June 2006        Darwin: 18-22 September 2006        Perth: 13-17 June 2006        Sydney: 22-28 September 2006        Melbourne: 3-13 July 2006        Brisbane: 8-9 November 2006        Cairns: 2 August 2006        Coolangatta: 27 October 2006        Hobart processes only closed charter international flights and are not required to have in-line x-raying of baggage at this time.        Alice Springs and Canberra have infrequent international flights and as per Regulation 4.17 'The Methods, Techniques and Equipment to be used for Screening' they are not required to operate in-line x-raying of baggage. 100 per cent of international baggage is however screened and cleared.All CTFR airports, that are required to, meet the 100 per cent level.</DOC>

Since 1 July 2004 there have been two incidents of trespass recorded at the RG Casey Building.

After hours burglary in the Currawong Child Care Centre.The burglary was reported to ACT police, the offender could not be identified and therefore no action could be taken against them.Extra security cameras were installed and patrol procedures strengthened.

Emergency door release activated from centre level 1 to south level 1 access, raised an alarm at the security desk.The offender was apprehended and reported to ACT police.Improved testing of the access control and emergency door release alarm systems has been implemented.There have been no recorded incidents of trespass at State Offices. To provide the detailed information sought for overseas posts would entail a significant diversion of resources and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified.</DOC>

The department has decentralised the purchasing of all stationery items including paper to line areas. Paper purchases are not separately identified from other stationery in the department's financial information system. To collect this information would require a significant diversion of resources to review all stationery invoices, which I am not prepared to authorise.While the department does not have a formal policy on duplex printing, printers have been set to default to duplex printing since mid 2005.</DOC>

The department has achieved certification by an external accredited auditor to the Australian (and International) Standard for Environmental Management Systems ISO 14001. Accordingly, printers provided throughout the R.G Casey building, portfolio Ministers' offices as well as regional and overseas offices are sourced and configured for duplex printing where possible.</DOC>

*The majority of the department's occupancy is in leased offices, and water supply is not separately metered for individual tenancies.
 
 Building owners recover water costs as part of general building outgoing charges. 
 
From Financial Year 2000/2001 DEST has taken a number of steps to reduce electricity consumption, including zoned lighting controls and introducing cleaning during daylight hours. 
 In June 2001, DEST joined a consortium of Commonwealth agencies in Canberra to purchase bulk electricity, which includes generation from renewable energy sources
In 2003/2004, DEST introduced multifunctional office machines, which provide greater energy efficiency than older printers, copiers and fax machines. 
 Energy efficiency is also actively considered in procurement decisions for electrical equipment, such as personal computers, and the department recently entered into a new personal computer supply contract that is expected to result in a 30% reduction in energy consumption.
DEST also actively engages with building owners to promote water and other conservation measures. 
 The department currently leases four buildings that have implemented waterless urinals.
 
 In August 2006 the department wrote to all its building owners and managers to encourage them to implement water conservation measures including waterless urinals and tap flow dispersers.
The department also has a high content recycled paper policy in place and has established environmental management systems and policies under its 'EnviroDEST' logo encouraging all staff to 'Rethink Reduce Reuse Repair Recycle', including electricity and water usage at home and at the office.</DOC>

The increase in use of the on-line domestic travel booking system, to nine per cent in 2007 and 15 per cent in 2008 was identified as a productivity initiative during the consultation process for the Members of Parliament (Staff) Collective Agreement 2006-2009. Discussions with members of the Staff Representative Group highlighted the on-line domestic travel booking system as an area where utilisation could be increased without impacting upon the operations, flexibility or entitlements of Senators and Members.The projected increases remained small to take into account the requirement of many Senators and Members to make frequent changes to reservations.The innovative use of technology was identified as a key objective of the Parliamentary Travel Services request for tender. Tenderers were required to provide a Strategic Services Plan (SSP) outlining their approach to the phased development and the introduction of initiatives to improve the cost effectiveness and quality of service delivery and to improve the overall value for money. In addition, Finance provided a pricing model for tenderers to complete that would enable the identification and comparison of charges for on-line bookings, consultant assisted bookings and bundled bookings. This pricing information and the SSP formed part of the tender evaluation and assisted in establishing the overall best value for money offer.I can confirm that the travel requirements of Members and Senators will not be the sole determinant of whether staff receive the pay increases in 2007 and 2008 under the new Collective Agreement as the targets relate to overall use of the system, rather than the bookings made by Senators or Members only.</DOC>

Yes.AMSA exercises its powers under international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions to conduct port State control inspections of foreign ships visiting Australian ports. As the Japanese whaling operations are generally conducted on the high seas in the Southern Ocean, international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions do not provide powers to AMSA to control compliance by foreign ships operating on the high seas. This is a matter for the ship's flag State. AMSA is supporting cooperative action at the International Maritime Organization to promote more robust safety and pollution prevention guidelines for ship operations in ice-covered waters and to consider a new work item concerning rules of engagement for protest vessels. AMSA issued Marine Notice 4/2006 on 18 January 2006 providing general advice to the shipping industry about ship safety and marine pollution prevention in Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic waters.

Mr Hicks has been visited by Australian officials on 20 occasions since his detention in 2001 - 19 visits to Guantanamo Bay and once on the USS Peleliu immediately after he was detained.The purpose of the visits has changed over time, from an initial focus on security and law enforcement by relevant agencies to a focus purely on Mr Hicks' welfare. On each occasion Mr Hicks' welfare has been assessed.None, however in common with standard practice DFAT consular officers have sought to visit Mr Hicks on a regular basis.Since February 2004, 14 visits have been undertaken by the Consul-General, Australian Embassy Washington. There were six earlier visits undertaken by officials from security and law enforcement agencies and DFAT officials participated in two of the earlier visits.No.and (g) No. Consular officials have, on occasion, been accompanied by relevant officials from the US Department of Defense. However, since the start of 2005, consular officials have met with Mr Hicks alone. To our knowledge, consular visits to Mr Hicks have not been supervised, monitored or recorded by US authorities.While some conditions consistent with a visit to a maximum security facility are imposed by US authorities, these conditions did not prevent us from undertaking our consular role.No.</DOC>

Yes. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has examined a passenger complaint about alleged loutish behaviour and excessive alcohol consumption on Virgin Blue Flight DJ434 on 10 March 2005.I am advised that the allegation was investigated by Virgin Blue in April 2005 according to its internal procedures and the results reported to CASA. CASA advised that it also investigated the allegation and was satisfied that there was no safety issue involved and that the matter was handled appropriately by Virgin Blue.There was no delay in investigating the matter.CASA provides regular reports to the Minister on significant aviation safety related incidents and developments. Passenger complaints about alcohol consumption are usually managed by CASA and the relevant airline.See (4) above.CASA advises that an airline is required to hold a liquor license to enable it to serve alcohol. These are State licenses. The licensing regulations require the airline licensee to have a Responsible Service of Alcohol policy. The Australian Government does not intend to review the Responsible Service of Alcohol guidelines used by the airlines.</DOC>

Sections of the Princes Highway between Sydney and Wollongong and between Melbourne and Sale are each on the defined AusLink National Network and are each examined in a corridor specific study. The Princes Highway between Wollongong and Sale is not part of the defined AusLink National Network; its contribution to traffic movements is considered in the Sydney-Melbourne corridor strategy.,  (3), (4) The assessment of the extent to which the Princes Highway should be part of the AusLink National Network was made as part of the Government's consideration of the extent of the Network in 2004. Parts of the road not declared to be on the Network remain the responsibility of the NSW and Victorian Governments.and  (6) AusLink includes four major programme elements. Only projects on the AusLink National Network can be funded as National Projects. The Australian Government has funded four projects on the Princes Highway under the AusLink Strategic Regional Programme: Princes Highway Safety Works ($15m); Pambula River Bridge ($5m); Batemans Bay Bypass ($10m); and Conjola Mountain Deviation ($10m).</DOC>

Yes, this price regulation was authorised via Direction 15 and Direction 16 which were made pursuant to the then Price Surveillance Act 1983.Yes.Yes.Yes. The Treasurer, the Honourable Peter Costello MP, and the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP, did make that announcement.Yes. The then Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Transport and Regional Services, the Honourable John Anderson MP, did make that announcement.Yes.Yes, by a small margin. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has used aeronautical revenue (adjusted) per passenger as the primary measure of aeronautical prices. Therefore, the answer here is based on the aeronautical revenue (adjusted) per passenger. In addition, as Sydney Airport was privatised on 25 June 2002, the appropriate period for comparison is from July 2002 to June 2006.According to the ACCC's airports price monitoring and financial report 2005-06 (the ACCC's 2005-06 report), over the period July 2002 to June 2006, aeronautical revenue per passenger excluding security (arising from Government-mandated security requirements) has increased by 13 per cent (see page 133 of the ACCC's 2005-06 report). Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 12.1 per cent (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Longer Term Series: CPI All Groups, Weighted Average of Eight Capital Cities). This sees aeronautical revenue increasing only 0.9 per cent higher than the CPI.No. As indicated in Question (5), regional airline operations into and out of Sydney are guaranteed reasonable access to Sydney Airport under the slot management system and with a prohibition on any increases in aeronautical charges that exceed the Consumer Price Index.No. Slots are allocated, not purchased. Sydney's slot management scheme is separated from airport pricing regulation at Sydney Airport.No. See the answer for Question (9).</DOC>

Should Bankstown Airport wish to receive international operations either as charter or regular passenger services it would need to be designated as an international airport under the Air Navigation Act 1920 and establish the necessary border agency and security arrangements. The current Bankstown Airport Master Plan limits the capacity of the airport to code 3C aircraft such as the BAe146, Fokker F100, Airbus A318/319 and aircraft of a similar size.</DOC>

Food prices, as with other products and as in the case of other remote communities, vary across the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in accordance with seasonal availability, power supply costs and competitive pricing practices.The Australian Government does not set prices and is constitutionally prohibited from price fixing.The government has established 'Outback Stores', a company that aims to reduce food costs and provide better quality food to remote communities. It will take a private sector approach to supporting Indigenous community stores that choose to participate.</DOC>

It has always been the Government's position that Mr Hicks faced serious allegations and that he should face trial in relation to those allegations.
 
 On 30 March 2007 Mr Hicks was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment (6 years and 3 months of which was suspended) after he pleaded guilty to the charge of providing material support for terrorism.
 
 Mr Hicks has applied for a transfer to Australia to serve out his custodial sentence, in accordance with Australian legislation and the provisions of the prisoner transfer arrangement that Australia has in place with the United States.
 
 This application is being processed expeditiously.

Yes. The Secretary-General of the OECD issued a media release on 18 January 2007 reporting on the consideration of this matter by the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions at its January 2007 meeting. On 14 March 2007, the OECD issued a second media release reflecting the outcome of the consideration of the matter at the Working Group's March 2007 meeting. The media release of 14 March 2007 states that the Working Group '... maintains its serious concerns as to whether the decision was consistent with the OECD Anti - Bribery Convention' and records the decision of the Working Group to conduct a supplementary review of the United Kingdom focused on progress in enacting a new foreign bribery law and in broadening the liability of legal persons for foreign bribery.The supplementary review will also examine whether systemic problems explain the lack of foreign bribery cases brought to prosecution as well as other matters raised in the context of the discontinuance of the BAE Al Yamamah investigation. The supplementary review will include an on-site visit to be conducted within one year. Both media releases are available at &lt;http://www.oecd.org&gt;.As a signatory to the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Australia fully supports the work of the Working Group and its decisions.</DOC>

On each occasion Mr Hicks' welfare was assessed.See attached table.Mr Hicks' welfare was assessed on the occasion of each visit.DFAT consular officers follow standard reporting requirements for all prison visits, which include commenting on the physical condition and morale of the detainee and any complaints of mistreatment.Issues raised by Mr Hicks, his legal team or family related to his physical and mental health were taken up with Guantanamo Bay authorities.The conditions under which Mr Hicks is being held were assessed on the occasion of each visit at which an official from my department was present.DFAT consular officers seek to ensure, as far as possible, during all prison visits that the basic needs of Australian prisoners are met and that the conditions of their detention are consistent with humanitarian standards of prisoner welfare. To this end they follow standard reporting requirements for all prison visits, which include commenting on issues such as the physical conditions of detention and the adequacy of available medical treatment.Issues raised by Mr Hicks, his legal team or family related to his conditions of detention were taken up with Guantanamo Bay authorities.Yessee (e) (i) above.see (e) (ii) above.No.DateAgency114-16 May 2002Law Enforcement/ Security agencies/ DFAT214-15 August 2002Security agencies321 November 2002Security agencies429 May 2003Security agencies54-5 November 2003Security agencies/ DFAT63-4 February 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)79 March 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)812 May 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)929 June 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)104-5 August 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)113 November 2004DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1217 January 2005DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1317-18 May 2005DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1415 September 2005DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1516 March 2006DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)168 June 2006DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1727 September 2006DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1830-31 January 2007DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)1926 March 2007DFAT (Consul-General- Washington)</DOC>

An eight-week non-payment period applies to job seekers who fail to comply with their participation requirements three or more times in a 12 month period. Job seekers who: refuse a job offer; are dismissed from employment due to misconduct; leave a job voluntarily or fail to commence; complete, participate in or comply with the conditions of a full time work for the dole program, could also be subject to an eight-week non-payment period.(Centrelink does not collect eight-week non-payment period data by federal electorates. However, Centrelink can identify data by Centrelink Customer Service Centres that fall within a federal electorate. A Customer Service Centre may service job seekers from multiple federal electorates. Allowing for this, as at 16 February 2007, 331 eight-week non-payment periods have been applied to job seekers serviced by Centrelink Customer Service Centres that are located within the federal electorate of Throsby.)

The Minister is aware of the article.Under the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991, it is the responsibility of the SBS Board to ensure that SBS acts in accordance with its Charter responsibilities.The Government notes that the SBS Board has directed management 'to ensure the new regime is constructed so as to preserve the SBS viewing experience and be consistent with SBS's Act and Charter'. The Board is also required to develop and publicise guidelines in relation to advertising and to include them in SBS's Corporate Plan, explaining how this will contribute to the achievement of SBS's objectives.The Government has maintained the five minute cap on commercial advertising introduced by the previous Labor Government. As such, the Government does not anticipate any reduction in multilingual and multicultural SBS content. Internal SBS programming decisions are the responsibility of the SBS Board and Executive.</DOC>

The Australian Government tabled in Parliament on 6 February 2007 the Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) Treaty with East Timor, in a timeframe and process agreed with the East Timor Government.  The Government formally exchanged notes with East Timor to bring CMATS and the International Unitisation Agreement for Greater Sunrise into force on 23 February 2007.  I invoked the national interest exemption in order to bring CMATS into force before the usual period that treaties lie before Parliament expired.  I wrote to Dr Andrew Southcott MP, Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, on 22 February 2007 to explain my reasons for invoking the national interest exemption for CMATS.  My letter of 22 February 2007 was tabled in Parliament on 20 March 2007.</DOC>

Centrelink staff do not 'reject' medical certificates lodged by Newstart Allowance recipients. Centrelink may accept the treating doctor's assessment that the person is temporarily incapacitated for all work, but may decide not to grant a temporary incapacity exemption because the person has been assessed as having capacity to participate in another suitable activity (such as the Personal Support Programme or Job Network).Centrelink staff who assess medical certificates lodged by Newstart Allowance recipients are required to have appropriate expertise in:relevant parts of the Social Security Law;relevant policy guidelines, including the Guide to Social Security Law;determining what medical evidence (and other specialist evidence) is required by the Social Security Law and relevant policy in order to make a decision about an incapacity exemption;interpreting available medical evidence and specialist assessments such as Job Capacity Assessments; andbrokering solutions that assist people towards participation.No legal liability should arise where Centrelink has acted reasonably and in accordance with the Social Security Law.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 5 hours and 31 minutes at an estimated cost of $297.</DOC>

In relation to soccer, the anti-siphoning list includes the English FA Cup Final and the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals tournament, including any matches in that tournament involving the Socceroos.SBS has already acquired exclusive free-to-air (FTA) television rights to the 2007 and 2008 English FA Cup Finals and the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, along with a number of FIFA competitions, including the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The latter follows SBS' successful coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.In April 2006, the Football Federation Australia (FFA) announced a seven year, $150 million deal with Fox Sports involving subscription television coverage of all Socceroos home matches, the A-league domestic club competition, the Asian Confederation's Champions League, the 2007 and 2011 Asian Cup tournaments, Asian Cup Qualifiers and selected World Cup qualification matches in 2008 and 2009.None of the events covered by the FFA/Fox Sports deal are on the anti-siphoning list, and in the past FTA coverage of Socceroos games has been inconsistent. The FFA has indicated that securing the long term security and stability of the game in Australia had been one of its primary objectives in entering into the deal with Fox Sports and that the funds obtained from the sale of the rights will be used to make substantial investments in national teams, in the national domestic competition and in the grassroots development of the game.</DOC>

Mr Samuel's comments on 16 January 2007 regarding domestic petrol prices primarily related to the relationship between the price of petrol in Australia and the international benchmark petrol price for Singapore 95 unleaded, not the international price of crude oil as asserted in the question. Notwithstanding that, Mr Samuel observed that at that time, the movement in domestic petrol prices was not quite in correlation with movements in the international benchmark petrol price for Singapore 95 unleaded petrol. On 24 January 2007, the ACCC announced that domestic prices had moved back in line with the international benchmark, and noted that if a marked disparity occurred again, allowing for the time lag, it would comment publicly.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows.As explained in the preamble to each document, while the tabled information comprises summary information, the supporting information, which is too bulky to be tabled, is available on written request to the Office of the Special Minister of State.The Department of Finance and Administration's circular No 2007/04 of 17 January 2007, to all Senators and Members, advised that the requirement to submit Travel Declarations when Travelling Allowance is not claimed was introduced prior to the implementation of tabling of all Parliamentarians' travel costs and the certification of monthly management reports. Both these measures provide for greater transparency and accountability of travel entitlements than was achieved by the submission of Travel Declarations when Travelling Allowance was not claimed.</DOC>

There is no evidence that the outbreak of E. coli infections in South Australia, during the months of January and February 2007, was related to imported foods.Extensive investigations by the South Australian Department of Health have not identified any association between the E. coli infections and a specific imported or domestically produced food. Furthermore, OzFoodNet, Australia's national system for foodborne illness surveillance and investigation, has not shown any increase in the number of illnesses associated with imported produce.All locally produced and imported food must satisfy the requirements of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, regarding a range of chemical and microbiological contaminants. Any food found to contain illegal levels of these contaminants is not permitted for sale.Since 1997, testing of imported fruit and vegetables by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has shown a high level of compliance with the requirements of the Food Standards Code.</DOC>

Yes.Yes.The Guidelines for the posthumous issue of medals have been revised to enable the issue of medals without the documents referred in the honourable member's question. If the applicant is the holder of previous awards and records demonstrate this, the medal is awarded posthumously to the ex-Australian Defence Force member and issued to the applicant. If the applicant is the holder of previous awards and the records do not demonstrate this, the applicant can provide a statutory declaration witnessed by a Justice of the Peace or another relevant signatory stating they have sighted the medal or medal group. If the applicant cannot satisfy these requirements, or provide a certified true copy of the Last Will and Testament of the medal recipient or a letter from a solicitor legally establishing the applicant as the medal recipient's sole beneficiary, the minimum requirement is either proof from the relevant State Birth Death and Marriages office that they are the sole surviving family descendant; or statutory declarations from other family members stating that the applicant is authorised to receive the entitlement.</DOC>

At its September 2005 meeting, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to conduct, via the National Counter-Terrorism Committee (NCTC), a review of the information and intelligence sharing processes between Commonwealth and State and Territory agencies to facilitate better information flow to counter crime and terrorism in the aviation sector. The Review of Information and Intelligence Sharing in the Aviation Sector was finalised in June 2006 in time for consideration by COAG at its July 2006 meeting.COAG agreed that the NCTC would consider the review and its recommendations, including how they may apply to information and intelligence sharing in other security contexts. The NCTC supported the broad conclusions of the review and is currently monitoring progress on jurisdictions' consideration of, and (where applicable) implementation of, the recommendations. The NCTC has also established a working group to develop a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of those recommendations which relate to the collection and sharing of intelligence between Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement agencies. My Department is also looking specifically at those recommendations in the Commonwealth context.The NCTC will be provided with a progress report on implementation of the recommendations in mid 2007. This will include updates from all jurisdictions and will outline any specific measures that have been put in place as a consequence of the review. Until this time, I am unable to provide the Honourable Member with any further information on the implementation of the recommendations.</DOC>

Although research is being conducted into the genetic modification of broadacre crops to improve their adaptation to drought, I am not aware of any genetically modified (GM) crops with specific drought tolerance properties being grown commercially anywhere in the world. However, conservation of soil water may be an indirect benefit when using herbicide tolerant GM crops in reduced or zero tillage cultivation systems.In Australia and around the world, the public and private sectors are working at developing drought resistant crops which could be available to Australian farmers in the future. These include varieties of wheat, cotton, corn (maize), rice, soybeans and canola.No.Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) sets food standards for food available for sale in Australia and New Zealand (including imported food). AQIS inspects and samples foods at the border according to risk, based on advice from FSANZ. To date FSANZ has not identified any GM food that require action by AQIS. State and territory authorities inspect and sample domestic and imported food at point of retail sale to ensure they comply with the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.</DOC>

The Australian Government does not condone torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited under international law. This prohibition is found in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Australia is a party.The application of the term 'torture' to a specific case will always depend on the particular circumstances of the case in question, including the impact on the individual of the conduct alleged to constitute torture. Whether any of the interrogation techniques referred to in parts (i)-(iii) of Question (a) will constitute torture depends on whether they fall within the definition of torture in international law, which is provided in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), to which Australia is a party. Generally, torture is understood to mean an act by a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering, for particular purposes, such as for obtaining information or for punishment. The definition makes clear that several elements must exist for an action to constitute torture.Torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.The US Administration confirmed in February 2005 that none of these techniques were used in relation to Mr Hicks or Mr Habib.</DOC>

This total consists of 14,625km of earthen irrigation supply channels, 1,191km of lined channel and 5,186km of natural water courses as water carriers (ANCID Benchmarking Summary Report 2004-05).I refer the honourable member to the following table from the ANCID Benchmarking Data Report 2004-05 which details the delivery efficiency gains for each irrigation area ('Table 28, ANCID Benchmarking Data Report 2004 - 05'). Around 11,000 gigalitres per year is diverted from the Basin for irrigation purposes ('CSIRO 2006 - The Shared Water Resources of the Murray-Darling Basin Part I').The price of irrigation water varies in each district and is dependent on a range of factors such as location, availability of water and the nature of the entitlement including general and high security entitlements. There is currently no calculation of total value for the water that is lost through evaporation and seepage in the Murray Darling Basin.The intricate hydrological processes of the Murray Darling Basin and nature of the water entitlement systems mean there is no direct relationship between open channel seepage / evaporation losses and water flowing through the Murray mouth.

The Bushmaster Infantry Mobility Vehicle provides a high level of protection and mobility to deployed Australian Forces. The rapid acquisition of 44 protected weapon stations was approved by the Government in July 2006. The first of these protected weapon stations was fitted on 2 February 2007, with the last expected to be fitted on 20 April 2007. The approved budget cost is $21.45 million.</DOC>

I am aware of reports regarding the imprisonment of Catholic clergy in China.No. We have raised a number of individual cases of concern, including those of other Catholic clergy, in our Australia-China Human Rights Dialogues, including the last round of Dialogue held in July 2006.The Government is aware of reports regarding confiscation of property. The Government has not made representations on the issue of property. We have raised the broader issue of freedom of religious practice in our Human Rights Dialogues and through our Embassy in Beijing (most recently in February 2007). We continue to urge China to ensure freedom of religious practice and to uphold its proclaimed policy of religious tolerance.</DOC>

I am aware of reports regarding North Koreans in China.Yes, I am aware of reports of these events taking place in January 2007. We have not specifically raised these reports with Chinese authorities. Australia has raised our longstanding concerns regarding North Koreans in China with the Chinese Government, including at the two most recent Australia-China Human Rights Dialogues, held in 2005 and 2006.Australia is concerned that China is not upholding its obligations under the Convention in relation to North Korean border crossers, and has raised these concerns with China during our Human Rights Dialogue. We have also raised our concerns with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).I am aware of reports of the 'Shenyang Six', who were detained in China on 21 December 2006.I have no information regarding whether they are still in detention in China or have been returned to North Korea.No, the 2007 Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue has not yet taken place.Yes. We have urged China through our Human Rights Dialogues to allow the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) access to DPRK border crossers in north-eastern China to determine whether or not they are refugees within the meaning of the Convention. In November 2006, we also raised the humanitarian situation of North Koreans in China with the office of the UNHCR in Beijing.</DOC>

A copy of the draft Standards document was circulated to members of the National Advisory Group on 25 January 2007. Some of the Advisory Group members circulated this document to service providers as they were asked to provide feedback that broadly represented their sector. The document was posted on my department's and the National Childcare Accreditation Council's (NCAC) websites to assist with that process.Following that initial period of consultation with the National Advisory Group, the draft Standards were released for public comment on 16 February 2007. A Preamble and a draft Quality Assurance Framework were also released for comment on 23 February 2006.An article about the development of an integrated child care quality assurance system will feature in the NCACs March newsletter 'Putting Children First', which is sent to every service provider registered with NCAC or registered on their mailing list.The closing date for comments on these draft papers is 10 April 2007.To date approximately 40 responses have been received as a result of the initial release of the standards.</DOC>

In 2005, the submarine force achieved a total of 490 days at sea with an average of 113 days per available submarine.In 2006, the submarine force achieved a total of 459 days at sea with an average 106 days per available submarine.In 2007, the submarine force is forecast to achieve a total of 397 days at sea with an average of 88 days per available submarine.The availability of submarines historically has been governed by two factors; those being the maintenance schedule and Navy-instituted constraints which aim to reduce the impact of prolonged submarine sea service on Navy personnelSubmariners are being recruited into the RAN through:
Direct Recruitment  -  Members of the public can now be recruited directly into Submarine service, without first gaining qualifications in surface ships.
Lateral Recruitment  -  Navy is focussing on internally marketing to attract existing recruits who are best placed to transition quickly into submarine service.
More Recruitment Resources  -  A new Submarine Careers Team has been created.
Training submarine  -  Navy will use HMAS COLLINS while it is berthed alongside HMAS STIRLING, for training additional submariners.</DOC>

The eleven individual questions comprising Question 4856 in turn consist of subordinate questions that seek responses regarding four incidents. In effect, over one hundred questions are asked. As such, a substantial diversion of law enforcement resources was required to answer them. The only information not provided in my original response are details of those who discovered the people involved in the incidents, details of oral and written reports made, actions taken by the recipients of such reports, and when that action was taken. Given the comprehensive responses already provided, there is no appreciable value in further diverting law enforcement resources to obtain the outstanding information.</DOC>

I am unable to answer your question to the extent requested as not all of the agencies involved in responding to the incidents fall within my portfolio. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on behalf of those agencies. I can, however, provide general details of the reporting of an incident in which an agency within my portfolio detected a trespasser. This information relates to the matter you refer to as Incident One, which occurred on 31 December 2003.Australian Protective Service (APS) officers responded and provided relevant details of the incident to the Australian Federal Police (AFP), Australian Customs Service and Sydney Airport Corporation Limited. This information was consistent with the description of the incident provided in response to Question 4856. Given the passage of time since the incident occurred it would be quite onerous to provide more detailed information and would require substantial and further diversion of AFP resources from core airport policing functions.</DOC>

The government is deeply concerned by Iran's recent failure to meet previous United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and International Atomic Energy Agency obligations. This includes Iran's non-compliance with the terms of UNSC Resolution 1696, as well as those of UNSC Resolution 1737 which was unanimously adopted on 23 December 2006. The Australian Government also continues to urge Iran to resume dialogue with European Union members, the United States and the United Nations (UN) on proposals to ensure Iran's suspension of its sensitive nuclear activities. Disappointingly, Iran has not yet responded to these proposals.The government will continue to work with its international partners to encourage Iran to meet its obligations and take the necessary steps to restore international confidence in its nuclear programme. The government remains committed to diplomatic efforts to resolve issues relating to Iran's nuclear programme and believes that UN processes should be given every opportunity. It is not appropriate to comment further on hypothetical future events.</DOC>

Yes.The proposal that I put to State and Territory Education Ministers at our Council meeting on 13-14 April 2007 did not threaten the withholding of Australian Government funding if they did not agree to the recommendations it set out.In line with recent research findings, I have proposed to establish pilot schemes to develop, trial and evaluate performance-based pay approaches. I have proposed that these approaches draw on a range of criteria and evidentiary sources to assess teacher performance. One outcome of the pilot would be determining the indicators that may be used, including in relation to student achievement.See 3.</DOC>

Yes.Yes.The Manual for Military Commissions requires trial counsel to provide to the defence a range of information, including any statements or documents that trial counsel intends to use as evidence in the prosecution case-in-chief or that are material to the preparation of the defence.Only where the sources, methods or activities by which evidence has been acquired are classified for reasons of national security and where the evidence is considered reliable by the military commission judge may these matters be protected from disclosure. In these circumstances, the trial judge may order an unclassified summary of the sources, methods, or activities by which the United States acquired the evidence to be provided to the commission and the defence.Such evidence would also be subject to the overriding discretion of the military commission judge to exclude any evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</DOC>

The only discretionary funds or grants which overseas Australian missions have access to is the Direct Aid Program (DAP). This is a discretionary grants program administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), funded by AusAID and managed by DFAT at AusAID's request. It is an integral component of Australia's overseas development program, and an integral part of Australia's wider foreign policy concerns and interests. It is a flexible, deliberately small grants program operating through 51 Australian overseas missions, funding projects in over 75 countries. DAP was designed to enable posts to respond quickly and effectively to requests for assistance by providing small grants for small scale development activities that are ancillary to the overseas development assistance program administered by AusAID. The goal of DAP is to address humanitarian hardship. In so doing it seeks to enhance and pursue international relations and public diplomacy objectives, and thereby to promote a distinctive and positive image of Australia in the world. However, the key objective is alleviation of hardship; any and all projects must meet that test to start with. A clear humanitarian or development outcome must be identified for a specific disadvantaged group of people in order for a project to be approved.In 2006-07, DFAT is administering $AUD 4 million in DAP funds, allocated to 51 posts for projects to be implemented in 75 countries of both resident and non-resident accreditation. DFAT, with input from AusAID, allocates funds to posts based on Australia's foreign and trade policy priorities and the development needs of recipient countries. Posts then allocate the funds to local, community-based organisations for humanitarian and development projects. In any given year, an individual post may fund as few as two or three or as many as twenty or thirty programs, depending on the size of its allocation and the type of projects it funds. Attachment A provides a year-on-year breakdown of (a) the overseas missions with access to the Direct Aid Program since the 2000-01 financial year; (b) the sum made available to each overseas mission in the initial allocation of funds by DFAT to posts; and (c) the final amount spent by each overseas mission, taking into account the reallocation of unspent funds by DFAT in February/March each year and additional ad-hoc funding received from AusAID for administration by the DAP.With respect to part (d) of the honourable member's question, to provide the detailed information sought would entail a significant diversion of resources and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified.Attachment ADepartment of Foreign Affairs and TradeDirect Aid Program (DAP) - historical allocations and expenditure, FY 2000-01 to FY 2006-07All amounts are AUD

Yes.Australia is aware that a US spokesman, Sean McCormack, said on March 6 this year that the UN Human Rights Council has had a 'nearly singular focus on issues related to Israel', to the exclusion of focusing on country situations in Cuba, Burma and North Korea. Australia has expressed its view to the UN General Assembly and to the Council itself, that the Council, in accordance with its mandate, must be able to address human rights violations, work towards their prevention and respond promptly to human rights emergencies.We specifically raised this view with the UN Human Rights Council on 23 March, when we participated in the related debate on country rapporteurs. We emphasised that the Council must be apprised of situations as they emerge, and that country-specific mandates were important for bringing to the Council's attention the human rights situations in countries such as Burma and North Korea.We have also raised our concerns with the UN about the human rights situation in Cuba, most recently at the UN General Assembly in November 2006.During Council sessions, we have also routinely raised issues of concern, including human rights abuses in Sudan, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and Fiji, with a view to assisting the Council focus on situations across the world.</DOC>

In answer to a question at the Energy, Environment and Air Quality Forum in Los Angeles on 13 January 2007, I stated 'We are thinking about it and we have been talking with the Indian Government about whether it would be possible to put together some arrangement with India whereby we could export uranium and be sure that that uranium could only be used for civil purposes  -  power generation. Not be used in any way, shape or form for military purposes.' I then went on to say: 'This whole India issue, it's a very difficult question because you can have the status quo  -  or becoming the status quo ante now  -  where India is not an NPT party, it has nuclear programs, it has nuclear weapons and you can take the view therefore we will have nothing to do with them. Or you can take the view that the Bush Administration has taken that well at least you can embrace some of India's nuclear industry and you can have inspections by the IAEA  -  the International Atomic Energy Agency  -  of some of those nuclear facilities. And some inspections and some transparency is better than none, isn't it? So that is the debate. I wouldn't say it's a fierce debate in Australia. I would say in Australia it's something that we're feeling our way on rather cautiously, I think that might be the best answer to your question'.Yes. India is not a party to the NPT.Current Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) guidelines preclude most forms of nuclear supply to India. The United States has foreshadowed that it will formally ask the NSG to agree to make an exception to its guidelines for India, so as to allow nuclear supply to India. For an exception to the NSG guidelines to be made for India, NSG members would need to be assured that any uranium supplied to India would be subject to safeguards so that it could not be used in India's military nuclear program but exclusively for India's civil nuclear power program. With regard to threats to the NPT, it is the Government's view that the greatest challenges to the NPT come from within: the unresolved cases of non-compliance by North Korea and Iran. India, on the other hand, is a responsible international state with a good record on preventing onwards proliferation of its nuclear materials and technology.</DOC>

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) does not accept the assertion that it has failed to properly monitor the Westpoint Mezzanine Companies. ASIC began monitoring Westpoint's fundraising activities in 2002, and commenced regulatory action in 2003. ASIC then instigated formal court proceedings in early 2004 regarding its fundraising activities. In connection with this court case ASIC also wrote to each investor in the two fundraising schemes providing the subject matter of the case informing them of ASIC's court action and outlining the nature of its concerns about the Westpoint mezzanine financings. ASIC also at various times placed warnings on its website alerting investors to the risks of putting money into high-yield debt instruments, with the first such release occurring in May 2003. In 2005 ASIC made applications for the winding up of certain Westpoint entities to the courts after receiving evidence that they were insolvent. The courts agreed to these applications, which has resulted in the end of all fundraising activities by the group.ASIC subsequently commenced investigations into the conduct of a number of parties involved in operating and promoting the Westpoint mezzanine finance schemes. Action has been started against a number of the main Westpoint directors, including group founder Mr Norman Carey. ASIC has obtained a court order freezing the personal assets of these individuals and barring them from leaving the country while its investigations continue. Those orders have since been extended.ASIC has also announced that it is investigating the conduct of financial advisers involved in promoting the Westpoint schemes and that appropriate action will be taken if breaches of the law are found to have occurred. ASIC acted to prevent one of the main promoters of the Westpoint schemes, Mr Neil Burnard, from leaving the country. Mr Burnard's assets have been frozen pending further investigations by ASIC.ASIC continues to investigate all aspects of the collapse of the Westpoint group of companies. Heavy penalties, both civil and criminal, apply to persons who may be in breach of their obligations under the Corporations Act 2001. Anyone found to be in breach of the law will be referred by ASIC to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution.The Australian Government made appropriate provisions in its 2006 Budget to ensure that ASIC has the necessary funding to pursue cases such as Westpoint. In particular, ASIC has received additional funding of $30 million per annum for the investigation and litigation of exceptional matters of significant public interest. Total additional funding of $234.6 million over the next four years has been made available to ASIC through the Budget.ASIC's actions since its insolvency applications to the courts have been principally intended to ensure that all assets and funds that are rightfully owned by Westpoint creditors are preserved for distribution to them. This is the reason for ASIC's applications to appoint liquidators to some of the mezzanine finance companies and also to the Westpoint parent company, all of which were agreed to by the courts.ASIC is now as a matter of urgency also considering the position of Westpoint directors, company officers, advisers and auditors to determine what further action could be taken. In April 2006 ASIC obtained court orders freezing the assets of the main Westpoint directors, including group founder Norman Carey, and banning them from leaving the country. Those orders remain in force. These orders were made based on evidence submitted by ASIC indicating fraudulent attempts to move company assets beyond the reach of creditors. ASIC's actions may have the potential to lead to the further recovery of funds for distribution to creditors. It is, however, too early at this stage to speculate on possible outcomes due to the ongoing nature of ASIC's investigations.ASIC is helping investors in claiming compensation from financial advisers who gave them defective advice. ASIC has put together detailed advice for Westpoint investors on how to claim compensation from such advisers. This advice is available through ASIC's website or upon telephone request. ASIC has announced that it will closely monitor the response of these advisers to ensure that client complaints and claims for compensation are dealt with quickly and fairly.</DOC>

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is giving particular attention to the conduct of financial advisers who promoted the Westpoint investments to retail clients. The conduct of these persons is strictly regulated under the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act). ASIC will take appropriate action against any advisers found guilty of breaching their obligations under the Act.The Government strongly encourages the provision of quality financial advice to consumers and has a strong record of backing this up with effective regulation. The key consideration is that there should be a correlation between the value of the advice given and the amount paid to the adviser, regardless of whether the payment occurs upfront or later through commission structures. Simplistic measures such as prohibiting commissions could lead to entire groups of consumers losing access to financial advice. In order to ensure that all Australian consumers have access to financial advice the best approach is therefore to encourage financial advisers to avoid conflicts of interest but, where unavoidable, to manage and disclose them to consumers. ASIC is working with industry to develop best practice guidance to advisers in this regard. There are indications that industry is moving away from pure sales commissions towards a model based on payment for performance of specified services.The existing law already requires the disclosure of all commission payments in a transaction. This requirement was introduced by the Government as part of the Financial Services Reform legislation passed in 2001. As stated above, the Government does not believe that introducing a cap on commissions or prohibiting them altogether is an appropriate measure for the reasons noted in the answer to question (2).</DOC>

ASIC has advised that prior to its May 2004 media release announcing action on mezzanine finance, 12 reports were received from the public concerning various entities in the Westpoint group, including a telephone call from Ms Brailey. However ASIC has no record of receiving a formal written complaint or other evidence from Ms Brailey to support her verbal complaint.No. ASIC has advised it received 7 complaints between August and December 2003 raising various concerns about mezzanine financing as a 'type' of fundraising and the issue of whether it is (or should be) a regulated product subject to Corporations Act licensing and disclosure requirements. None of the complaints during that period raised concerns about investment redemption, solvency or seminar activity.and (4) The ACCC has advised that, prior to June 2004, it received 19 consumer complaints and inquiries regarding Westpoint's activities. As the complaints and inquiries were not within ACCC's jurisdiction, the parties were advised to direct their correspondence or inquiries to ASIC.ASIC has advised that, prior to June 2004, it received:one complaint in 1999 and one in 2000 raising concerns on whether the particular promissory note involved was a regulated product requiring formal disclosure under the Corporations Law;two complaints in 2002 regarding the same issue, and whether the Westpoint product required an ASIC license for its promotion and sale; andseven complaints in 2003 (as noted in Q2 above) and one in early 2004 raising the following issues: whether the promissory note is a regulated product; the problem of non-completion of fit-out for Westpoint project apartments and movement of monies between property developments in order to complete projects; the failed sale of a Westpoint apartment by a complainant; whether a license was required to promote or sell the Westpoint product; failure of one Westpoint entity to hold an AGM and lodge a financial report; and concerns in relation to the offer of refinance by a Westpoint entity.These complaints culminated in the Westpoint mezzanine finance action announced by ASIC in May 2004.In late 2003 and early 2004, ASIC entered into talks with Westpoint aimed at bringing the group's fundraising within the protections of the Corporations Act. ASIC was not aware of the apparently large scale involvement of licensed financial planners advising on Westpoint products. Following the failure of these talks, ASIC started legal proceedings in May 2004 to argue that the funds should have been raised in accordance with the Corporations Act disclosure regime.In mid-2004, ASIC required many of the companies involved in the Westpoint Group to file independently audited financial statements. These statements reported that the companies were solvent and were signed off by the independent auditors as true and correct, without qualification. In 2004 and early 2005, some investors raised concerns about delayed redemption of investments and income distributions. However, in the course of ASIC making enquiries into these complaints, these investors were paid by the relevant Westpoint entity.Subsequent to the publicity surrounding ASIC's actions in late 2005, ASIC began to receive large numbers of complaints which suggested that advisers may have been providing investors with inappropriate or inadequate advice about Westpoint. ASIC is currently investigating the activities of these advisers, including how Westpoint was included on their approved product lists, and what commissions they earned.(5)   Under section 50 of the ASIC Act, ASIC can cause civil proceedings to be commenced and carried on in the name of persons in certain circumstances. In order to exercise this power, ASIC must have already undertaken an investigation or examination (under the ASIC Act) of the breaches. In that regard, ASIC's Westpoint related investigations have not yet been finalised.ASIC is also alert to other ways in which assistance may be provided to investors, including by pursuing regulatory proceedings that may result in a court making findings of fact that may assist any subsequent private actions (such as through section 12GG of the ASIC Act).</DOC>

These initiatives have resulted in Telstra providing information about a consumer's right to have reasonable access to a payphone and enhancing its payphone removal consultation processes. Telstra has also consulted with low income groups regarding proposed payphone removals, and ACMA has improved its existing processes to provide a clear complaints process in relation to Telstra's adherence to its payphone commitments.Telstra has advised that it will provide a response to this question directly to the Member for Kingsford Smith.Telstra must consider the criteria specified in its Standard Marketing Plan (SMP), which is approved by ACMA, in making payphone installation, relocation and removal decisions. Section 3.8 of the SMP specifies the criteria for the provision of Telstra payphones, with clauses 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 specifically dealing with removals and relocations respectively.

and (2) My Department advises that for the financial years since Jul 2000 there have been no recorded instances of departmental employees accessing files or records without proper authorisation.The Department has a number of policies and procedures in place to safeguard veterans' personal information and mitigate against the risk of unauthorised use. These policies and procedures formally advise staff that they must not access records out of personal interest or curiosity nor allow unauthorised persons to access the files as this may constitute a breach of the Privacy Act or the Crimes Act 1914.Departmental staff are advised that they must only access records which have privacy or security classifications if they have the authority to view them, and, where applicable, an appropriate level of security clearance.Access to the Department's client hard copy records is controlled through the its Records Management Systems with movements of records between staff members recorded. Each staff member is responsible for the secure storage of client records in their custody and for ensuring access by other departmental staff is supervised and appropriate. All transfers of the records are required to be recorded through the Records Mangement System.My Department also has several major computer systems which contain client and private information. The Department controls access to information by controlling access to each system and through IT Security Plans for each system. System access must be authorised by relevant business managers.The Australian War Memorial holds electronic and hard copy personal files relating to Memorial employees. Access to both electronic and hard copy files is restricted to members of the People Management Section. Employees are able to access their own information upon request.The Memorial does not hold customer files but does retain customer records including name, address, purchases and payment details both electronically and in hard copy. Access to this information is restricted and audited annually by the ANAO.System access by staff is monitored through activity logs which can detect events such as unauthorised login attempts, excessive login attempts, firewall activity and mainframe computer access. This analysis can also monitor user access to selected sensitive IT systems and files. Logging facilities associated with specific systems are able to provide visibility on what information is accessed.My Department is currently reviewing its information security arrangements to ensure that policy and procedures are understood and that facilities for monitoring for inappropriate access are adequate and are being used effectively.Within the Australian War Memorial the human resource and financial management system (SAP) has a detailed audit trail which keeps records of access to personal information and customer records. Access to the electronic records is audited fortnightly by the Memorial and annually by the ANAO.</DOC>

I am unable to advise of the number of community-based transitional care services operating in the federal electorate of Lowe as the Transitional Care Program (TCP) is administered by the Department of Health and Ageing. The TCP, which is jointly funded by States and Territories and the Australian Government, assists people, including veterans, to improve their independence after a hospital stay, and to return home rather than enter residential aged care.The Beyond Home transitional care project is not a TCP service as it provides advice to elderly people on how to assess and access effective (residential) aged care services. The Inner West Neighbour Aid Inc was provided with seeding funding for two years through my Department's Veteran and Community Grants. The organisation's application for funding included a strategy to ensure the ongoing viability of the program, including seeking recurrent funding from other agencies.No. The Veteran and Community Grants is a small discretionary grants program and with only $2.9 million available in the 2006-07 financial year, it does not have the capacity to provide ongoing funding for projects. The purpose of these grants is to provide seeding funds for the development of projects that will become sustainable and financially viable.My Department's Veterans and Community Grants program does not provide recurrent funding. It encourages self sustaining projects and advises on alternative sources of funding. My Department has advised that it has worked with Inner West Neighbour Aid Inc in an attempt to identify alternate sources of funding for this project.</DOC>

Following are the total costs for Canberra based landline and mobile services (rental and call costs). To identify call costs alone would require a significant diversion of resources.To provide the detailed information sought from each post and state and territory office would entail a significant diversion of resources and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified.Landline telephone callsLandline call charges generated through the R G Casey PABX in Canberra, excluding any reimbursement for personal calls and services managed on behalf of Other Government Organisations were:2004-05 - $3.896 m2005-06 - $3.394 mDuring this period, the roll-out of the Voicenet system, which allows DFAT to make calls to posts overseas using our internal communications network, together with the major clean up of redundant lines and introduction of dedicated voice links between agencies, significantly reduced domestic and international telephone call costs.Mobile telephone callsCanberra based mobile phones, excluding any reimbursement for personal use were:2004-05 - $1.572 m2005-06  -  $1.801 mTrials during 2005-06 of Smart Phone and Blackberry technologies, to support mobile officers, contributed to the increase in 2005-06 mobile costs.</DOC>

DAFF also intends investigating opportunities for metering of water that it directly consumes although this is expected to be a long term initiative given that in many instances it will not be possible to separately meter DAFF consumption due to piping configurations and/or space limitations.DAFF central office is moving to new premises in October 2007. Electricity and water saving initiatives in the new buildings include:T5 lighting that switches off after hours and in specific areas when not in use;Automated blinds to control heat gain and reduce air-conditioning costs;External gardens that will reduce air-conditioning costs;Rainwater collection for reuse (an expected 30% saving in water consumption);Stormwater retention and reuse for irrigation, wash down and cooling towers;No flush/waterless urinals and toilets flushed with rainwater;Infrared sensors for hand taps (operates only when hands are under spout); and4A rated toilets (4.5L/3L full/half flush).</DOC>

The Australian Bureau of Statistics' monthly Labour Force publication indicates that employment increased by 276 600 (or 2.7 per cent) between March 2006 (when WorkChoices commenced) and March 2007 (latest available data). The increase in employment over this period comprised 265 400 full-time jobs and 11 200 part-time positions.        Data is not available on the number of casual jobs created since the introduction of WorkChoices.        The Australia Bureau of Statistics defines full-time workers as persons who usually work        35 hours or more per week (in all jobs) or those who, despite usually working less than 35 hours a week, actually worked 35 hours or more during the survey reference week.        Part-time workers are defined as persons who usually work less than 35 hours per week (in all jobs) and either did so during the survey reference week, or were not at work in the reference week.        The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a casual employee as one who does not receive paid leave entitlements. It has more recently included in the definition those who are in receipt of one form of paid leave entitlements but are self - identifying as casuals.
1 This does not include owner managers of incorporated businesses (who are classified separately) or those who have no leave entitlements but are self-identifying as not being casually employed.
All of the 276 600 jobs created since March 2006 have either been full-time or part-time jobs. As indicated in (a) above, data is not available on the number of casual jobs created since the introduction of WorkChoices.These data are not available. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

[1]   SMBP  -  Seats or services per week to/from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth
   1.  Under the Country column, 'Passenger' allows for the carriage of cargo and mail on passenger aircraft. 'Freight' means freight (cargo) only aircraft.  Under some agreements, passenger capacity entitlements may be used for dedicated freight aircraft services.  In most cases freight capacity cannot be converted into passenger capacity.2.   Where the capacity entitlement is for a number of services per week, the services can be operated with aircraft of any type and seating capacity, unless otherwise stated.3.   Where an aircraft type is named in the capacity column it is normally accompanied by words such as 'or equivalent' and an aircraft substitution formula is included to allow for the use of aircraft of greater or lesser capacity at a lower of higher weekly frequency.

As part of its February 2006 National Reform Agenda, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) signed the Competition and Infrastructure Reform Agreement to provide for a simpler and consistent national approach to the economic regulation of nationally significant infrastructure - including for ports, railways and other export-related infrastructure.The Competition and Infrastructure Reform Agreement supports efficient use of and investment in significant national infrastructure, by promoting commercial negotiations between service providers and access seekers, increasing regulatory certainty and consistency and reducing compliance costs for infrastructure operators and users. It contains commitments to streamline regulatory processes in Part IIIA, and other access regimes, by incorporating binding time limits and a limited form of merits review for regulatory decisions.The Government is currently progressing implementation of initiatives in the Competition and Infrastructure Reform Agreement with the states and territories. At its 13 April 2007 meeting, COAG reaffirmed its commitments in this area and agreed on a range of implementation milestones and timeframes for the Agreement.The framework for access to nationally significant infrastructure provided through Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act (the National Access Regime) is designed to support efficient use of and investment in significant infrastructure. To this effect, Part IIIA contains clear safeguards to ensure that regulated access to significant infrastructure would result in economically efficient outcomes. For example, among other criteria, nationally significant infrastructure cannot be declared under Part IIIA unless:it is uneconomical to develop another facility;the facilities do not comprise part of a production process;access would promote a material increase in competition in another market; andaccess would not be contrary to the public interest.In addition, on 1 October 2006, legislation took effect implementing the Australian Government's response to a Productivity Commission inquiry on the National Access Regime, including measures to promote more efficient investment in and operation of essential infrastructure, such as:insertion of an objects clause that emphasises the promotion of economically efficient operation of, use of and investment in infrastructure, and to which decision makers under Part IIIA are required explicitly to have regard when making decisions; andinclusion of pricing principles for access terms and conditions to which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) must have regard when conducting arbitrations for declared services and assessing access undertaking and access code applications.The amendments also facilitate more timely and, in turn, less costly regulatory procedures, including the introduction of target time limits for regulatory decisions, and enhance the transparency and accountability of the Regime through strengthened consultation and reporting requirements for the National Competition Council and the ACCC.</DOC>

Following a competitive process, a base rental per annum, payable in advance, was negotiated between the Commonwealth and Foxerco Pty Ltd for the lease of Avalon Airport. This rent is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and is now also subject to GST.There is scope for additional payments resulting from revenue growth at the airport. An amount is payable by the lessee each financial year for the gross revenue it receives in excess of the agreed base revenue, with the latter indexed annually to the CPI. The amount payable by the lessee is ten per cent of the difference between the base as adjusted and gross revenue.The following payments have been made each financial year since the initial lease of the airport;PeriodTotal1996/97$59,041.101997/98$162,231.001998/99$234,943.871999/2000$151,454.842000/01$155,450.422001/02$160,519.922002/03$165,616.882003/04$170,071.192004/05$173,878.962005/06$178,096.332006/07 (to 30/4/07)$151,783.85</DOC>

The Royal Australian Mint (Mint) determines which commemorative coins it submits to the Minister for approval according to its Policy on Coin Design and Issue which is available on its website.The mintage for new coin releases is determined by: assessing the attractiveness of the coin to the market; the type of coin; historical mintages and the perceived demand for the coin.A currency determination is prepared for all coins approved for issue by the Minister. Currency determinations are legislative instruments and are therefore publicly available on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. Various publications such as Mint Issue, press releases and advertising are also used to inform the public of new releases.Numismatic or collector coins issued by the Mint are available to purchase directly from the Mint through direct sales, online sales or shop sales. Australia Post and registered coin dealers also stock a selection of the Mint's products.Australia Post and registered coin dealers are able to purchase collector coins at specified wholesale prices and receive dealer notices of new collector coin issues slightly ahead of public release to assist them in marketing the Mint's products.Not applicable  -  the 2005 Anzac coin was issued by the Perth Mint not the Mint.

The Treasury administers one programme, the HIH Claims Support Scheme, that community organisations, businesses and individuals in the federal electorate of Throsby can apply for funding from. In order to qualify for support from the scheme individuals and not-for-profit organisations must have held an HIH policy at the time of the collapse of the company and have suffered an insurable loss or have been receiving salary continuance or other payments from HIH at that time. Eligibility for assistance is also means tested for some types of claim. Small businesses in Australia may also qualify for claims assistance in some circumstances. The scheme closed to new applicants in February 2004. However late claims may be made in limited circumstances.The claims made against the scheme by organisations and individuals in the federal electorate of Throsby, in 2005 and 2006, cannot readily be determined.</DOC>

Eligibility for the CSHC is based on a person's adjusted taxable income, which is not affected by a tax rebate.From 1 July 2007 superannuation benefits paid from a taxed source to a person aged 60 or over will no longer be considered to be part of a person's taxable income. Therefore after this time, some people who are currently unable to qualify for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC), who have income from a taxed superannuation source, will be able to satisfy the income test for the CSHC. That is, contrary to the inference in the question, the measures are more beneficial to self funded retirees.</DOC>

The graph shows the cumulative funding that the Government planned to provide for the Major Capital Equipment Program over the relevant 10 year planning period. For 2004-14, this refers to the 10 years between 2004/05 and 2013/14, while for 2006-16 this refers to the 10 years between 2006-07 and 2015-16. No assumptions were made as the graph reflects the actual planning provisions.The 2006-16 Total Major Capital Equipment Series is higher than the 2004-14 series due to the continuing increase in planning provisions the Government has provided Defence since the 2000 White Paper. For much of the timescale where the two series overlap, the figures are generally similar. However, there are two key differences. The first is that towards the end of the overlap period (2011/12 to 2013/14), the 2006-16 series benefits from the Government's 2006/07 Budget decision to extend the three per cent growth that was originally only agreed until 2010/11. The second difference is that the 2004-14 series contains the two earliest and hence smallest figures, while the 2006-16 series contains the two latest and hence largest figures.The major reason for the difference between the two Projected Capability Plan Series is the continuation of the three per cent growth to 2015/16. This increased the DCP planning provisions by around $2 billion over the period 2011/12 to 2015/16.There was no particular attempt made to smooth the graph. It was produced using a series of straight lines joining annual funding figures. The scale, however, makes irregularities difficult to see.</DOC>

The Federal Court of Australia ordered that Goreta Aboriginal Corporation1 be placed into liquidation on 2 March 2006. Mr Alan Scott, Sims Partners was appointed as the liquidator.In 2004-05, OATSIH provided a total of $126,479 (GST exclusive) in recurrent funding and $372,334 (GST exclusive) in capital works funding to the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation. The 2004-05 recurrent funding was provided in four quarterly payments on 21 September 2004, 5 October 2004, 30 March 2005 and 5 April 2005. The capital works funding was paid at the completion of project milestones on 13 January 2004, 15 February 2005, 29 April 2005 and 15 June 2005. OATSIH did not provide any recurrent or capital works funding directly to Goreta Aboriginal Corporation in 2005-06.Yes.No.The Goreta Aboriginal Corporation was required to account for the expenditure of both the 2004-05 recurrent and capital works funding to OATSIH by providing an Audited Financial Statement by a Qualified Auditor in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards by 30 September following the end of the financial year.No. (ii) Yes.On 18 February 2005, OATSIH received the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation's 2003-04 Audit Report, which contained an Audit Qualification.On 5 April 2005, OATSIH officers met with the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation Board regarding the Audit Qualification and received assurances that measures were in place to respond to this Qualification.On 6 June 2005, OATSIH received advice that the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations (ORAC) was conducting a review of the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation under s60 of the Aboriginal Associations and Councils Act (Cth) 1976 (the Act).On 5 July 2005, at the request of the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation Board, OATSIH commenced negotiations with Wakefield Health seeking their agreement to continue the delivery of the health services previously provided by the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation, including the transfer of OATSIH recurrent health funding.On 20 July 2005, ORAC advised OATSIH that on 13 July 2005 it had issued a s71 notice requiring the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation to give reason why an Administrator should not be appointed due to breaches of the Act. OATSIH was advised that the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation was not insolvent.On 22 July 2005, the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation held a meeting with its funders to advise of steps that the organisation was taking to address issues identified in the ORAC report. The Goreta Aboriginal Corporation Board confirmed that they agreed to the transfer of recurrent health funds to Wakefield Health to enable health service delivery to the local community to continue.On 5 August 2005, OATSIH was advised that funds released to the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation for final payments for capital works undertaken at the Goreta clinic were not in the organisation's account. Work on the capital works project was immediately suspended.On 11 August 2005, OATSIH was advised that the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation would suspend its operations on 16 August 2005 until ORAC appointed an Administrator.On 19 September 2005, OATSIH and other funders met with Korda Mentha, which commenced as Administrator of the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation at the beginning of September 2005. The health service continued to be operated by the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation under the management of the Administrator pending finalisation of OATSIH negotiations with Wakefield Health.In November 2005, OATSIH completed its negotiations with Wakefield Health and the 2005 - 06 OATSIH recurrent funds were paid to Wakefield Health for the delivery of health services to the local Aboriginal community. The Goreta Aboriginal Corporation Administrator was to invoice Wakefield Health for those health services provided by Goreta from July 2005 to the date of formal transfer of responsibility for the services to Wakefield Health.On 2 March 2006, the Goreta Aboriginal Corporation went into liquidation. The Department has not yet received the Liquidator's Report. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

The Australian Government welcomed the deferral of consideration of the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Draft Declaration), as it is committed to working towards a declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples that can be adopted by States in the United Nations General Assembly by consensus. The Australian Government welcomes further consultations to improve a text that we cannot support in its current form.The text of Australia's joint statements on the Draft Declaration, detailing key Government concerns with the text, is available on the website of Australia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York. See:http://www.australiaun.org/The Australian Government was actively involved in the UN Working Group on the Draft Declaration for over 10 years and repeatedly advocated compromise language with the aim of addressing the concerns it had with the text, and achieving consensus among all States. As stated in our response to part 2 of this Question on Notice, Australia has made a number of statements to the international community that are on the record and publicly available, sharing the concerns it had with the text.The international community is still discussing the process for further consultations on the Draft Declaration. The Australian Government has approached the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, to advocate a further consultation process that is open, transparent and has the potential to deliver substantial improvements to the text of the Draft Declaration. The Australian Government is awaiting confirmation by the President of the General Assembly of the proposed consultation process, before deciding on the most appropriate next steps for resolution of Australia's concerns with the text.</DOC>

Job Capacity Assessments determine a job seeker's work capacity and the most appropriate Australian Government Employment Service to assist him or her return to work. This includes referring job seekers to the Disability Employment Network, Job Network, Vocational Rehabilitation Services, the Personal Support Programme or the Job Placement, Employment and Training Programme. Not every person with disability requires the specialist assistance available under the Disability Employment Network.The current Disability Employment Network contracts continue through to 30 June 2009. No Government decision has been taken on future purchasing arrangements beyond this future date.Current Disability Employment Network providers accepted a contract offer from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The contractual arrangements with Disability Employment Network providers do not guarantee a specified number or flow of job seekers. Nationally, referrals to the uncapped stream of the Disability Employment Network are broadly in line with the expectations outlined in associated tender documentation.Current Disability Employment Network providers accepted a contract offer from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The Department is always willing to discuss any concerns individual providers may have.As per (1), Job Capacity Assessments refer job seekers to the most appropriate Australian Government Employment Service to assist them return to work. If there is no Capped Disability Employment Network place available, a job seeker with an obligation to look for work is referred to Job Network. The availability of a Disability Employment Network place does not affect a job seeker's income support payment.The Australian Government provides a range of services to assist job seekers with disability. These programmes are tailored to the different needs of job seekers and include Job Network, Disability Employment Network and Vocational Rehabilitation Services.These services are highly successful in assisting people with disability to find employment. For example, Job Network records over 50 000 job placements for job seekers with disability each year. Between 1 July 2006 and 20 April 2007, over 6 200 Disability Employment Network participants and 5 900 Vocational Rehabilitation Service participants have achieved a 26-week outcome.New Uncapped streams of the Disability Employment Network and Vocational Rehabilitation Service were also introduced on 1 July 2006 to assist all job seekers with a partial work capacity affected by the changes to the Disability Support Pension under Welfare to Work. Between 1 July 2006 and 20 April 2007, over 17 500 job seekers have accessed these new services.</DOC>

and (2) The Department of the Environment and Water Resources prepares emissions inventories and statistics for Australia, but does not compile them for other countries. While requests for statistics about OECD countries should be made to the OECD, the Department understands that the OECD provides emissions data since 1990 for individual countries, not as a share of world emissions.Informal feedback from Australian researchers who travelled to Antarctica over the past few years indicates that long travel time by ship is the most inhibiting factor to increased participation of scientists in Australia's Antarctic programme.        Currently, about 70 scientists travel to the Antarctic continent annually. This number is expected to rise to about 100 (about 40%) by 2010/2011 after the introduction of intercontinental air transport.Australia's Antarctic programme publishes about 140 papers annually in the peer-reviewed literature. An increase in the number of scientists taken south will result in an increase in scientific output. As the average time lag between undertaking field work and the appearance of finished research papers is between 2 and 4 years, and the air service will have a limited start in 2007/2008, it is expected that an increase in the numbers of scientific publications will appear in the literature not later than 2010/2011.The introduction of the Antarctic air service will improve the operational efficiency and flexibility of Australia's Antarctic programme in the following ways:The air service will eliminate the reliance on shipping as the sole means of access to the continent. This will be evident on commencement of the service in 2007/2008.Improved access to the continent. Access to each Australian station is typically twice each season by ship. The air service will provide more opportunities for scientists to travel to Antarctica to do their research.Travel by air will significantly reduce travel times.There will be improved ability to respond to emergencies.The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) is currently undertaking the following projects of economic significance.        The AAD is examining the structure and function of the marine ecosystem, leading to an estimation of the level of sustainable harvest of commercial fish from the Southern Ocean (under the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources):The objective of this project is to set safe harvest levels for finfish and Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean.The potential economic value of this project is significant: the Patagonian toothfish fishery alone is currently worth about $25 million annually to Australian fishing companies. Without sustainable harvest levels, overfishing will cause the industry to collapse.        The AAD is collecting ice data for high-latitude shipping:The objective of this project is to provide information on ice type, concentration, extent, and drift.The potential economic value of this project is significant, as besetment in sea ice is extremely costly.        The AAD contributes to the monitoring of the environment of space to provide an understanding of the effects on electricity transmission and satellite performance of cosmic ray outbursts and solar eruptions:The objective of this project is to understand the role of cosmic radiation and solar eruptions on space weather conditions which might impair the functioning of power grids on Earth and satellites in space.The potential economic value of this project is high: warning of the impairment of functioning of power grids and satellites provides opportunities to mitigate (or avoid) costly outages.The AAD is currently supporting the following projects of economic significance:Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather data collection for weather forecasting and climate science:The objective of this project is to obtain weather information, which feeds into the data banks of the BoM and of the International Meteorological Organisation to facilitate improved weather forecasting and to inform climate science.The potential economic value of this support is very high. Improved forecasting and better informed climate science have significant potential to improve agricultural outcomes and to reduce the economic effects of adverse weather events and understanding the global climate system has benefits for all sectors of the economy.        Ionosphere Prediction Service (Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources) daily monitoring of the ionosphere above Antarctica:The objective of this project is to monitor the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere to identify weakening in the ionosphere (during times of solar flare activity or during outbursts of cosmic gamma rays) that impair or eliminate communication by High Frequency (HF) radio waves.The potential economic value of this support is high: warning of impairment of HF communication provides opportunities to mitigate (or avoid) costly outages.        Geoscience Australia (Industry Tourism and Resources) monitoring of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty:The objective of this project is to monitor underground nuclear tests using a seismometer in a deep vault.</DOC>

Yes.and (3) It is a common practice for members and senators of all parties to conduct fund-raising events, the detailed arrangements of which vary.and (5) My office has received a submission from Club Marconi regarding the redevelopment of its sporting facilities. The submission was forwarded to my department for consideration.Government decisions are made on the merits of the issues raised.My government is a strong supporter of sport in Australia. Whilst primary responsibility for sporting infrastructure resides with state and territory governments, many organisations also seek the assistance of the Australian Government.It is not possible for the Australian Government to support all requests that come before it and consequently my office wrote to the President of Club Marconi on 22 December 2006 encouraging him to explore support for the redevelopment of its sporting facilities with the New South Wales Government.</DOC>

It would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for each department to disaggregate from that information the value of consultancy contracts valued at less than $10,000.Details of each consultancy contract valued at more than $10,000 are published either in each department's annual report or on its website.</DOC>

In 1997, the Australian Government introduced its Measures for Improving the Energy Efficiency in Government Operations policy.This policy formed part of the Government's greenhouse gas abatement strategy and included energy efficiency measures for government operated buildings. The policy also required departments to report their organisations' energy performance to their respective ministers and to my Department for collation.Information provided by departments has shown that from 2003-04 to 2004 - 05:energy consumption fell by 0.89%; andgreenhouse gas emissions fell by 0.23%.Over the six year period from 1999-00 to 2004-05:energy consumption fell by 5.2%; andgreenhouse gas emissions fell by 2.3%.The 1997 policy has since been replaced by the Energy Efficiency in Government Operations policy, which was announced in September 2006.Key features of the new policy include:revised energy intensity portfolio targets, to be met by the 2011-2012 financial year, of 7500 megajoules/person/annum for office tenant light and power (down from 10000 megajoules) and 400 megajoules/m²/annum for office central services (down from 500 megajoules);new buildings and major refurbishments are required to achieve a 4.5 star rating under the Australian Building Greenhouse Rating (ABGR) scheme;a Green Lease Schedule (GLS) has been developed to ensure that agencies manage their ongoing office building energy consumption at the 4.5 star level;the requirement for agencies to continue reporting their energy consumption annually to my Department;an energy management strategy for the Department of Defence; andthe development of targets for public buildings, laboratories and computer centres and a strategy for existing buildings.The energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from departmental buildings are published in the Energy Use in the Australian Government's Operations report. This report is tabled in Parliament each year by my Department.</DOC>

Yes.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) exercises its powers under international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions to conduct port State control inspections of foreign ships visiting Australian ports. As the Japanese whaling operations are generally conducted on the high seas in the Southern Ocean, international ship safety and pollution prevention conventions do not provide powers to AMSA to control compliance by foreign ships operating on the high seas. This is a matter for the ship's flag State. AMSA is supporting cooperative action at the International Maritime Organization to promote more robust safety and pollution prevention guidelines for ship operations in ice-covered waters and to consider a new work item concerning rules of engagement for protest vessels. AMSA issued Marine Notice 4/2006 on 18 January 2006 providing general advice to the shipping industry about ship safety and marine pollution prevention in Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic waters. Marine Notice 4/2006 is available on AMSA's Internet site at: www.amsa.gov.au.</DOC>

The combustion of one tonne of unwashed black coal from New South Wales or Queensland typically produces about 2.15 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e). This calculation assumes that a tonne of coal contains 23.9 gigajoules (GJ) of embodied energy and an average of 89.8 kilogrammes of CO2-e per GJ when combusted.The Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, states that carbon capture and storage (geosequestration) is an option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the potential to reduce overall mitigation costs and increase the flexibility in achieving emission reductions.Geosequestration uses technology to capture and concentrate carbon dioxide produced in industrial and energy-related sources, transport it to a suitable storage location, and then store it away from the atmosphere in geological formations such as deep saline aquifers, depleted oil or gas fields, and unmineable coal seams.Geosequestration technologies are expected to be commercially available by 2020 to 2030, and to offer the potential for substantial emissions reductions from Australia's stationary emissions sources from 2030 onwards.The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies has advised the Department of the Environment and Water Resources that Australia has a technical potential to store about 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. Accurate estimates that take account of economic and site-specific issues that may influence the actual level of carbon storage, are not available for Australia.</DOC>

The Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) raised this event with the United States' Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and has been advised by the TSA that upon notification of the event, the airport in question was notified. The TSA advises that there is a process in place to evaluate the circumstances of any alleged screening failure. The TSA is of the view that in this case, it is not evident that any such screening failure occurred. The item in question was an inert hand grenade which did not contain any explosives and therefore would not be expected to be detected by an explosive detection system. It was packed in checked baggage and in the TSA's view was not considered a prohibited item and was not dangerous to the flight. The TSA further advises that the purpose of screening checked baggage in the United States is to detect objects that are a danger to the aircraft, and an inert grenade is not considered dangerous.</DOC>

In respect of project Air 5376 Phase 3  -  Hornet Upgrade.The total approved for Phase 3 is AUD$982.823 million (January 2007 Price Basis).Up to 49 aircraft are scheduled to receive a centre barrel replacement. The estimated cost per aircraft under the mature production program is AUD$10 million (January 2007 Price Basis).One. The prototype aircraft has had its new centre barrel installed at the L-3 MAS facility in Mirabel, Canada and the aircraft is currently undergoing initial rebuild. The aircraft will be transported back to RAAF Base Williamtown in late June 2007 where it will undergo final re-build, with flight testing planned for late 2007.The final aircraft will be delivered in late 2014. This date is based on the assumption that all 49 aircraft are inducted for centre barrel replacement.The prototype activity (one aircraft) is currently being conducted at the L-3 MAS facility in Mirabel, Canada. The production of the remaining aircraft will be primarily located in Williamtown, Australia, although some specialised activities may be conducted overseas.Aircraft inducted for Low Rate Initial Production, commencing October 2007, are expected to initially take 354 working days to complete. The time is expected to reduce to 276 working days (early 2010) as knowledge and skill levels improve.Project planning sees the mature centre barrel replacement program having three production lines, with up to 11 aircraft under modification at any point in time.The Hornet Upgrade Phase 3 Project Office has 17 staff, some of whom are shared with other projects. Australian industry involvement is predicted to increase up to 180 when Phase 3.2B is in mature full rate production.Unexpected poor physical condition of the aircraft represents schedule risk for the project. Poor physical condition is mainly due to corrosion. This damage is usually first found on aircraft after initial disassembly.Phase 3 is not a capability upgrade project, it is a structural refurbishment program. As a refurbishment program, the traditional in-service date definitions are not applicable. For Phase 3.1, the original and achieved in-service date was January 2004. To date 30 aircraft have been delivered of the 69 aircraft planned to undergo Phase 3.1 refurbishment.For Phase 3.2B of this project, the in-service date corresponds with the delivery of the first aircraft following centre barrel replacement.Original Scheduled In-Service Date - November 2007.Current Scheduled In-Service Date - November 2007.Up to nine years additional service life, depending on incorporation window.Phase 3.2B is the final major refurbishment required to remedy fatigue issues on Hornet airframes. Some follow-on wing refurbishment may be required. This requirement is still being analysed and scoped.Broadly speaking, the Structural Life of Type for the F/A-18 Hornet is based on the fatigue accrued during flight, particularly air combat manoeuvring that subjects the aircraft to stress. The fatigue accrued is measured at the point where the wings are attached to the main structural component of the aircraft, called the Centre Barrel. The measurement of accrued fatigue is used to calculate the percentage of structural life of type remaining. Prior to Hornet Upgrade Phase 3, aircraft were limited to a maximum of 62 per cent fatigue life due to fatigue damage. Aircraft that complete the entire Phase 3 program, including centre barrel replacement, will have 100 per cent fatigue life restored.</DOC>

There is evidence that weaponry and training support from Iran is being provided to at least some Shiite militia in Iraq.and (3) In a press release issued following his meeting with Prime Minister Howard on 17 March, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki emphasised that stability in Iraq can only be achieved through a commitment to the 'political process and national reconciliation, in finding common ground between all groups of the Iraqi people, while using force against anyone who does not follow the law.' In his 21 March speech to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Prime Minister Howard said that 'Iraq's neighbours must recognise that greater stability in Iraq is fundamental to their national security. Iran in particular must end the transfer of arms to radical Shiite groups attacking coalition forces and Iraqi Sunni civilians.'</DOC>

The Australian Government does not comment on leaked material.The situation in Iraq is complex and levels of violence remain of serious concern. It is encouraging that the Iraqi Government has played a significant role in the planning for and has committed to the new security plan. The Iraqi authorities, with the full support of the Coalition, are increasingly taking the lead and working to defeat those involved in the violence.The Pentagon Report to Congress of March 2007 notes that 'Prime Minister Maliki has demonstrated a commitment to retraining and reforming police units that are shown to be servicing sectarian or parochial interests,' and 'Prime Minister Maliki has also promised that the GOI [Government of Iraq] will engage all illegally armed groups, regardless of sectarian affiliation.'</DOC>

The National Code of Practice for CCTV Systems for the Mass Passenger Transport Sector for Counter-Terrorism was approved by the Council of Australian Governments on 14 July 2006. The Code is available online at:&lt;www.coag.gov.au/meetings/140706/#related&gt;.The Code is designed to be applied on a voluntary basis using a risk based approach. The Code allows each jurisdiction (state and territory) to determine and apply its own requirements for counter-terrorism purposes, taking into account its own overall priorities for the application of resources to wider counter-terrorism initiatives. The balance will depend on the threat, risk and vulnerability associated within the particular operating environment and other existing counter-terrorism arrangements, plans and capabilities.</DOC>

Yes.Yes. In respect to the query about circumstances in which I would investigate allegations of contact between ministerial staff and CSIRO officers over public comments, I do not consider it appropriate to respond to questions of a speculative nature.As previously advised, it is up to CSIRO as a statutory authority to determine and implement its own policies in relation to matters such as public comment. I note that CSIRO has in place a public comment policy that was released in July 2006 following an extensive consultation process.

The purpose of the Flagpole Funding Initiative (FFI) is to assist schools in fulfilling the Australian Government's requirement for schools to have a functioning flagpole and fly the Australian flag. This has been a condition of Australian Government schools funding since 1 January 2005.The Government provides up to $1,500, through the Flagpole Funding Initiative (FFI), to assist with the purchase and installation of one flagpole per school where currently there is no functioning flagpole. Programme guidelines limit eligibility for funding under this initiative to schools that do not have a functioning flagpole capable of flying the Australian flag and to one flagpole only.Yardarm-style flagpoles which allow up to three flags to be flown simultaneously may be purchased using FFI funding up to the maximum of $1,500. Many schools have taken up this option which enables them to fly the Aboriginal or another Indigenous flag in addition to the Australian flag.</DOC>

The Premier of South Australia, the Hon Mike Rann MP, wrote to me on 5 March 2007, in his capacity as Chair of the Council for the Australian Federation about master planning issues at major airports. In my response I indicated that the Commonwealth considers the most effective planning regime for airport developments involves one planning jurisdiction, and that the Commonwealth is committed to consultation to ensure a meaningful exchange between airport operators and all relevant stakeholders.I am advised that the Southern Cross Consortium acquired the lease of Sydney airport in June 2003. The Airports Act 1996 establishes the planning regime that applies to federally leased airports. This allows some non-aeronautical development to take place but this is balanced against the aeronautical developments required for the continuing operation of the site as an airport.I am advised that as indicated in the Sydney Airport's Master Plan, the greater portion of airport land is quarantined for aeronautical use.</DOC>

As at 31 December 2006, South Australia had a total of 286 allocated Extended Aged Care at Home (EACH) packages, of which 281 are currently operational. The remaining five EACH packages allocated in the 2006 Aged Care Approvals Round are scheduled to become operational on 4 June 2007.As at 30 June 2006 (most current data available at the electorate level), there were a total of four EACH services located in the electorate of Hindmarsh operating 40 EACH packages.In accordance with Part 6.2  -  Protection of information of the Aged Care Act 1997, I am unable to provide details of care recipients in receipt of EACH packages.Under Section 21-4 of the Aged Care Act 1997, a person is eligible to receive flexible care if:the person has physical, social and psychological needs that require the provision of care;those needs can be met appropriately through flexible care services; andthe person meets the criteria (if any) specified in the Approval of Care Recipients Principles as the criteria that a person must meet in order to be eligible to be approved as a recipient of flexible care.Under Section 5.7 of the Approval of Care Recipients Principles 1997, a person is eligible to receive flexible care in the form of extended aged care at home only if the person:is assessed under section 22-4 of the Act as requiring a high level of residential care;prefers to receive extended aged care at home; andis able to live at home with the support of extended aged care at home.</DOC>

Yes.I am aware that the lawsuit alleges that Yahoo was complicit in the arrests of various Chinese internet activists.Yes.The Australian government made representations to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing on 7 June 2006, expressing our concern that the prison sentence given to Wang Xiaoning was disproportionate, and about reports that he had suffered mistreatment in prison. Mr Wang's case was also raised during the last round of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was held in Canberra on 25 July 2006.The Australian government has not raised the issue with Yahoo or other internet search engines operating in Australia. The Australian government does not regulate the behaviour of foreign, private corporations operating in third countries.</DOC>

Defence Capability Assessment Branch (the Branch) was established in March 2004. The Branch scrutinises and provides advice on all Defence equipment projects with a value greater than $8 million. The vast majority of these, by number and value, are Defence Capability Plan projects. The Defence Annual Reports list the projects approved with the exception of a small number that are highly classified and not publicly disclosed. The list for financial year 2005-06 is at page 178 of the Defence Annual Report 2005-06.Given that the Branch has only been in existence for three years, and Defence capital projects typically run for a very extended period, there has been no benchmarking undertaken to date to assess the effectiveness of the Branch on the estimated and final costs and timelines of approved projects. In any case, the Branch is only one element of the post-Kinnaird system and it may be difficult to fully assess the effectiveness of the Branch in isolation.As the Branch scrutinises all projects with a value greater than the Defence Minister's delegation, it is not clear how a meaningful comparative evaluation of projects reviewed and not reviewed could be undertaken. Once the Kinnaird reforms have been in place for a sufficient period, it will be possible to evaluate the full suite of reforms relative to earlier experience.</DOC>

The imports component of the ICS was implemented in October 2005.From October 2005 onwards sea cargo has been reported to Customs via the ICS. Cargo is reported at 'bill of lading' level in the ICS.There may be many hundreds of bills of lading for a single vessel.In the nineteen month period (October 2005 to April 2007), 77.8% of all bills of lading were reported 'On-Time' and 11.6% of were reported after vessel arrival.ICS data for October 2005 only applies to vessel arrivals after cutover to the ICS on 12 October 2005.The 11.6% 'After Vessel Arrival' figure does not indicate that 11.6% of all vessels have not reported their entire cargo until after arriving at their first port Australia. Rather, it indicates the proportion (377,091) of all bills of lading (3,262,377) reported to Customs after vessel arrival.Table 2 sets out the requested cargo reporting timeliness statistics using bills of lading data sourced from the ICS.TABLE 2

Financial Assistance Schemes
My Department administers schemes for the provision of financial assistance for legal costs and related expenses. These schemes exist to provide assistance in cases where legal aid is not generally available from legal aid commissions and where the circumstances give rise to a special Commonwealth interest. People and organisations in the electoral division of Richmond can apply for assistance directly from the Australian Government under these schemes. It has been a long-standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, not to provide information in relation to individual applications in order to protect the confidential information of applicants and to comply with obligations imposed by the Privacy Act 1988.

Core DepartmentThere have been no occasions where staff of the core department have accessed files or records without proper authorisation.See the response to Question 1.No.No.The Department periodically audits electronic access to files and records.Child Support AgencyThe CSA Fraud Prevention Team (FPT) commenced investigations from December 2005. Prior investigations were undertaken by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on behalf of the CSA. Access to pre-December 2005 ATO records is unavailable.        Since inception of the CSA FPT in December 2005, 1 substantiated instance of unauthorised access has been identified and 6 matters identified since July 2006 that are still under investigation.In the substantiated instance, the employee was dismissed.It should be noted that this type of information is not recorded on the case management systems of the Australian Tax Office or CSA. To obtain this information, the original files would have to be retrieved from storage which would take a considerable amount of time and cost.No.No.All accesses are recorded on audit user history logs. These date back to 1993 and are held by the ATO which maintains those logs on behalf of the CSA.        Proactive data matching is undertaken to identify unauthorised access. This is a new software tool which detects suspected unauthorised access to customer records. It proactively searches CSA's customer case management system and identifies behaviours that may signal non-work related access. Staff are unable to detect the tool's presence.        In addition, CSA undertakes proactive monitoring of accesses to high profile customers.CRS AustraliaCRS Australia has had the following number of employees accessing files or records without proper authorisation since 1 July 2000:        1 July 2000  -  30 June 2001: 0        1 July 2001  -  30 June 2002: 0        1 July 2002  -  30 June 2003: 0        1 July 2003  -  30 June 2004: 0        1 July 2004  -  30 June 2005: 4        1 July 2005  -  30 June 2006: 0An investigation was undertaken by an independent investigator who found all four employees were found to have breached the APS Core of Conduct in that they did not act with care and diligence and also did not treat the complainant with respect and courtesy. All received counselling from a senior manager and were issued with a direction to write formal letters of apology to the complainant. While it is understood there was no malicious intent by the four employees, they were further cautioned regarding their obligations to comply with the Code of Conduct as set out in the Public Service Act 1999, and the values and behaviours expected of them as members of the Australian Public Service. The range of repercussions for breaches of the Code of Conduct was detailed and they were cautioned about their future behaviour.All four instances of unauthorised access were for the same former client's            file. A formal letter of apology was forwarded to the former client.No.No.The following auditing procedures exist to monitor employee access to files and records:        Audits are conducted when indicated as part of an investigation, or in response to specific requests. Automated monitoring of logs of access to electronic records has been implemented and an audit of this access is scheduled for 2007.</DOC>

Disability Support Pension recipients may be selected for a review to ensure that they receive their correct entitlement. The Disability Support Pension recipient in question was selected for such an entitlement review. As part of the review the person was referred for a Job Capacity Assessment. As a result of the review, the Disability Support Pension was cancelled and the individual was sent a letter notifying the individual of the cancellation. It is Centrelink policy to notify people in writing of a decision to cancel their payment.        In this case, the Disability Support Pension recipient requested Centrelink to reconsider the decision. In doing so, it became evident that the Job Capacity Assessor was not initially informed that the Disability Support Pension recipient was working in supported employment. The Centrelink delegate reviewed the decision and Disability Support Pension was restored.The individual was not denied an advocate. The Job Capacity Assessment organisation that conducted the assessment has advised that the individual arrived with their partner and the partner declined to participate in the assessment interview.Please see answer to Question 2.The Job Capacity Assessment Provider has advised that the individual told the assessor that they were working full time and did not indicate this was with a Business Service. The assessor had no information available to them that would have indicated this position was not in an open employment situation. The assessor has confirmed that she did not advise the client to get a 'proper job'.A person who works in supported employment and who is not capable of work at or above the relevant minimum wage because of their impairment, is not deemed ineligible for the Disability Support Pension.Disability Support Pension recipients may be reviewed from time to time, to ensure that they receive their correct entitlement. These reviews have been in place for many years. People in supported employment are not excluded from such reviews. The type of review for which the customer in question had been selected, was unrelated to the Welfare to Work changes. However, Disability Support Pensioners who are assessed as not being able to undertake work at or above relevant award wages will not have their pension cancelled on the basis of work capacity.</DOC>

There are currently 230 funded Major Capital Equipment projects managed within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO).Public information on the status of Approved Major Capital Equipment Projects may be found at section two of the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements 2007-08.There is only one project that presently requires additional funds associated with project delay. There are five under review and the estimates for additional expenditure for these projects are commercially sensitive. Releasing the exact details could prejudice ongoing project negotiations and / or reviews.The forecast length of delay varies from a minimum of two weeks out to a number of years for some legacy projects. The delays will not necessarily delay the initial delivery into service of the project or the final delivery into service.The reasons for the delays are many, with the majority being contractor delay (both domestic and foreign). Other causes include DMO and other Government agency delays, delays with facilities, platforms being available due to operational tempo, and delays with contract formation or variation.Chief Executive Officer DMO is available to provide a personal briefing on individual projects under management in the Defence Materiel Organisation.</DOC>

In respect of project Land 106-M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier upgrade:The current contract for the upgrade of the M113 was signed on 15 July 2002.and (c) The budget for the upgrade has not changed in real terms and is $603 million in January 2007 prices.The first upgraded M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier production vehicle was contracted for delivery in April 2006.No fully operational upgraded M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers have been delivered. Delivery of the first systems is scheduled for November 2007; however, Defence assesses that this may slip to mid 2008 due to unresolved problems with the brake system.The technical specification for the upgraded M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers was agreed by Defence and the contractor as an attachment to the contract signed on 15 July 2002. The contracted armour specification for the upgraded M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles was last revised on 30 August 2005.The upgraded M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier has a ballistic protection system that can defeat a vast array of conventional weapon types. However, no armoured vehicle in operation anywhere around the world today can withstand the full array of weaponry that could be encountered in modern operations.</DOC>

A small part time brass band was formed at Richmond in 1932 to meet the requirements of the base. The current Air Command Band was formed in 1988.I am aware that both the Air Command Band and the RAAF Central Band support charitable causes whenever their primary military duties allow.The Air Command Band has not been disbanded, it has been amalgamated with the RAAF Central Band and every member of the Air Command Band has been offered the opportunity to continue in service with the new amalgamated RAAF Band. The existing RAAF Bands were amalgamated in order to more effectively use Permanent Air Force positions to meet operational requirements, by enabling reservists to serve as RAAF musicians. By making better use of reservists the new, amalgamated band will be better able to provide military musical support across Australia as well as continuing to support military and civilian organisations in both Melbourne and Sydney.The decision to amalgamate the Air Command Band with RAAF Central Band has already been taken and the new, amalgamated RAAF Band will be operational with effect January 2008.</DOC>

Every ship deployed to the Persian Gulf is fully prepared to operate in the anticipated threat environment. This preparation involves fitting additional equipment and weapons to enhance the ship's self-protection capability and undertaking dedicated training activities. The preparation culminates in a rigorous assessment of crew proficiency and the ship's material condition. During the training and assessment process, the ship is required to demonstrate an ability to defend itself against the range of possible threats. All aspects of the ship's readiness for the mission are assessed by the Fleet Commander before it can deploy to the Persian Gulf.        Ships also operate under robust rules of engagement that include the right of self defence. The ships deployed to the Persian Gulf are the RAN's most capable platforms in terms of self-defence capabilities and they are well equipped to deal with any likely eventuality should armed conflict develop between Iran and the United States.The ability to competently conduct Anti-Ship Missile Defence is one of the required proficiencies each ship must successfully demonstrate before deploying to the Persian Gulf.Ships and crews deployed to the Persian Gulf are trained and tested against small boat attacks. This capability must be sufficiently demonstrated prior to deployment.The ADF is completely integrated into Coalition Force operations and planning in the Persian Gulf. There are Liaison Officers embedded in a number of US and Coalition Headquarters, including the Naval Command, and they provide situational awareness on activities and allied planning in the Middle East.        Ships deployed to the Persian Gulf are integrated into Coalition Force operations, communications, intelligence and other information exchange systems. This integration, combined with embedded Liaison Officers, ensures Australian units have access to sufficient intelligence warnings of both Coalition Force and threat activities.</DOC>

Yes. All of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, including the 1990 Australia-Russia agreement, require that Australia's consent must be obtained before Australian obligated nuclear material can be transferred to a third country. Under longstanding Australian policy, consent is given only for transfers to countries with which Australia has a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement. Australia does not have such an agreement with Iran.No. The Russian Government has supported international action against Iran's sensitive nuclear activities, including United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696 which made mandatory the suspension of all Iran's uranium enrichment and heavy water activities, and Resolutions 1737 and 1747 which imposed sanctions on Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing and heavy water-related activities, and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. The Russian Government also supported the package of incentives, including guaranteed access to civil nuclear power, offered to Iran by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China) and Germany in June 2006.The Government notes that the Russian Government's assistance to Iran's nuclear program, namely building and supplying fuel to Iran's light water reactor at Bushehr, is not in contravention of United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Iran's nuclear program. Under Operative Paragraph 3 (b) of United Nations Security Resolution 1737, provision to Iran of equipment for light water reactors and low-enriched uranium when it is incorporated in assembled nuclear fuel elements for light water reactors is not prohibited. The agreement between Russia and Iran for Russia to provide nuclear fuel to the Bushehr reactor also requires that all spent nuclear fuel be returned to Russia. The Government also notes that the Russian Government has not supplied nuclear fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power reactor.The Government has not sought any specific assurances from Russia that it is able to comply with its nuclear safeguards commitments to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These commitments are treaty-level commitments between Russia and the IAEA and the IAEA has not made any unfavourable comment on Russia's compliance with its safeguards commitments. Moreover, Russia has received substantial assistance, from the IAEA and several governments, in upgrading its capabilities in the nuclear safeguards and security areas. The Government has no reason to believe Russia's safeguards system will not be able to deal with the anticipated significant expansion of its nuclear power industry.</DOC>

The following hormonal growth promotants, or HGPs, are registered in Australia for use on cattle:- oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone, trenbolone acetate and zeranol.It is not possible to give figures for the exact number of cattle treated with HGP implants, however, in 2005/2006 almost 6 million doses of HGPs were supplied into the Australian market with somewhere between 3 and 6 million animals treated.There are restrictions placed on the use of HGPs. The legal supply and use can only take place if the HGPs are registered by the Agricultural Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).All registered veterinary chemical products, including HGPs, have an APVMA-approved label which provides instructions and limitations on the use of the product. The approved label of each registered HGP product has restraints of the general nature:- DO NOT use this product on any other species of animal- USE ONLY in steers (or cows, as relevant to the product)- DO NOT use this product on HGP-free accredited cattle- This product may only be supplied in accordance with the Agvet Code Regulations.The States and Territories place further restrictions on the use of HGPs in cattle:- treated animals must be identified by an ear punch;- the dose must be implanted in the ear; and- records must be kept of the treatment of individual animals.Regulations 47-54 of the Agvet Code Regulations provide that HGPs may only be supplied by importers and retailers who have a notification number allocated by the APVMA. Persons who purchase HGPs must fill in a form at the time of supply which records the quantity of HGPs supplied.</DOC>

Australia shares the widespread international concern at the extreme urgency of the humanitarian and security crisis in Darfur, and considers that strengthening of the international peacekeeping mission in the region is essential. Australia shares international concerns about the viability of the Darfur Peace Agreement, and considers that political processes may need reinvigoration to ensure there is a peace to keep.We have strongly supported UN Security Council actions on Darfur, including measures to impose an arms embargo and a no- fly zone over Darfur, as well as travel bans and asset freezes on individuals who impede the peace process or commit crimes or atrocities (Resolution 1591 of March 2005). We also support UN Security Council Resolution 1706 of August 2006, which extended the mandate of the United Nations' Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) from Southern Sudan to include Darfur.Yes. On 29 March 2005, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on all parties to the Darfur conflict, including the Government of Sudan (Resolution 1591). I welcomed this decision in a media release of 6 April 2005.No.In his most recent report on Darfur to the UN Security Council (23 February 2007), the UN Secretary-General noted that the Government of Sudan had intensified aerial bombardment of rebel positions, including civilian targets. The report described specific incidents of airborne attacks by Government of Sudan forces in Northern Darfur (15 November 2006; 11, 20 and 21 December 2006) and Southern Darfur (4 and 5 December 2006). The Secretary-General also commented that Sudanese Government forces had expanded aerial bombings into new areas of Darfur since 16 January 2007.Australia strongly supports UN Security Council Resolution 1591 and has implemented the arms embargo into domestic law under Regulation 7 of the Charter of the United Nations (Sanctions - Sudan) Regulations 2005 and Regulation 13CM of the Customs (Prohibited Exports).Australia is aware that on 2 May 2007 the International Criminal Court Pre-Trial Chamber I issued arrest warrants in respect of a former Minister of State for the Interior and an alleged Janjaweed militia leader in respect of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. These indictments followed the referral of the situation in Sudan to the ICC by the Security Council in Resolution 1593 (2005). Australia supported that referral by the Security Council. It is for the Prosecutor of the ICC to decide whether action should be pursued in respect of other persons.</DOC>

The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts sought advice from the Treasurer in order to respond to this question as the Treasurer has portfolio responsibility for the ACCC.The Treasurer has advised that the ACCC considers whether mergers, including media mergers, are likely to breach section 50 of the Trade Practices Act (Cth)(TPA).Section 50 of the TPA prohibits mergers and acquisitions that would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a substantial market. Section 50 of the TPA is specifically concerned with the effect on competition of mergers.Parties may also choose to apply directly to the Australian Competition Tribunal for merger authorisation under section 95AU of the TPA. Authorisation provides protection to an acquirer from court action under section 50 of the TPA. The Tribunal may grant authorisation if it is satisfied that the proposed merger would be likely to generate such a public benefit that the proposed merger should be allowed to proceed.In relation to merger authorisations, the ACCC is required to provide assistance to the Competition Tribunal in its assessment of such matters. In particular, the ACCC is required to provide the Tribunal with a report on any authorisation application and the Tribunal is required to consider this report. In addition, the ACCC is entitled to appear before the Tribunal, provide evidence, examine and cross examine witnesses and make submissions as determined by the ACCC.</DOC>

I am aware of the closure of the outside school hours program run by the Nest Family Resource Centre Inc. which incorporates the following services; Dunsborough After School Care; Dunsborough Holiday Program; Busselton Vacation Care and Busselton Combined Outside School Hours Care.My department provided Nest Family Resource Centre Inc. with support under the Child Care Support Program. Sustainability Assistance funding was provided from 1 July 2005.In addition, the Western Australian Professional Support Coordinator offered professional advice, support and training to the service, including business and financial management support.The decision to close the outside school hours care program run by the Nest Family Resource Centre Inc. is a business decision made by that particular organisation.Prior to closure, the September 2006 quarter (3 July 2006 to 1 October 2006) reported the following number of children in attendance; 18 children at Dunsborough After School Care; 31 children at Dunsborough Holiday Program; 59 children at Busselton Vacation Care and 45 children at Busselton Combined Outside School Hours Care.It is not possible to separately identify children attending the Before School Care and After School Care components of the Busselton Combined Outside School Hours Care services as they are combined on the Centrelink system.There are two additional Vacation Care services located within 2.7 kilometres of the Busselton/Dunsborough area. There are also two Family Day Care Schemes in the Busselton area.The 2006-07 Budget removed the limit on Outside School Hours Care child care places from 1 July 2006. This means that existing Outside School Hours Care services can now provide an unlimited number of child care places provided they meet relevant criteria, including state or territory licensing and regulation requirements and participate in Australian Government Quality Assurance processes. New services are also able to open in response to unmet demand.</DOC>

However, operating at the current level of reduced allocations, the Murray River will not run dry in 2006-07; there is sufficient water in storage, including weir pools, to ensure the river continues to flow until next winter.Nevertheless, record low inflows in 2006-07 coupled with minimal water reserves in storages constitute a very real threat to water users and communities in the Basin and further afield in Adelaide and South Australia should dry conditions persist in 2007 - 08. In response to this unprecedented situation, the Prime Minister convened a Summit on the MDB with the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and Acting Premier of Queensland on 7 November 2006. At the meeting it was agreed to: 'establish a group of high-level officials drawn from First Minister's Departments and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to examine contingency planning to secure urban water supplies during 2007-08.'The Senior Officials' Group submitted the MDB Contingency Planning Report to the Prime Minister, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia on 20 December 2006. Governments have agreed to the recommendations of the report and progress has been made on implementing many of the priority measures.To date, the key outcomes of the report are  - South Australia has commenced additional pumping into Mount Lofty storages from the Murray River to ensure water supply for Adelaide. Certain wetlands have been disconnected and work on lowering off-takes in pumping stations will commence in March 2007. The target end of season reserve in Lake Victoria has also been lowered.Preliminarily preparation for the construction of a temporary weir near Wellington on the Murray River has begun. A decision on whether to complete construction of a weir will be made by the South Australian Government later in 2007.Consideration is being given to the role of the Snowy in 2007-08, should dry conditions continue. Senior officials are examining the role of Snowy Hydro Ltd, balancing the provisions of water with the important role the Snowy plays in electricity supply in the national electricity market.Contingency planning of 'at risk' towns are being finalised by State Governments and resources will be available to put them into place should the need arise.The Senior Officials' Group is overseeing ongoing preparatory work and will provide regular reports to First Ministers, the next report will be provided to First Ministers in mid March.The approach taken on contingency measures is designed to manage the risks of low inflow of water into the Basin. The probability of there being sufficient water to meet critical needs is higher than the probability that there will not be. If seasonal conditions improve then plans will be modified as the situation develops. With proper preparations, the critical demands of urban areas and towns, and other households relying on the water supply systems of the southern MDB, will be able to be met even in the face of another very dry year in 2007-08.</DOC>

It is at the discretion of the decision maker whether the information on the English language ability of the applicant provided with the application is sufficient, or if further testing is required. Under current Subclass 457 arrangements, substantial weight is placed on the judgement of the sponsoring employer given the negative impact of delays associated with formal testing.In May 2006 the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced that greater emphasis would be placed on English language in the subclass 457 visa, subject to consultation with industry on detailed implementation of this.</DOC>

The Inclusion Support Subsidy is provided to assist eligible child care services with the cost of including children with additional needs. The Inclusion Support Subsidy can contribute to the provision of relief staff while the carer attends training, specialist equipment and resources and employing an additional worker to increase the staff to child ratio. The focus of the Inclusion Support Subsidy is to build the capacity of child care services to include a child with ongoing high support needs.The Inclusion Support Subsidy is available to child care centres as a contribution only and is not intended to be a reimbursement for all costs associated with the inclusion of a child with ongoing high support needs. Funding should be utilised in conjunction with a range of other strategies to enhance a service's capacity to include all children.The Inclusion Support Program provides a range of practical supports and assistance to child care services to help them to build capacity to provide a quality child care environment for all children, including those with additional needs. More detailed information about the program is available athttp://www.facsia.gov.au/internet/facsinternet.nsf/childcare/services-ipsp.htm#4.Because the aim of the Inclusion Support Subsidy is to facilitate inclusion in mainstream environments, it is not designed to provide one-on-one support for any individual child.Nor is it a substitute for specialised disability services like respite and health care.The number of carers in a service funded by the Inclusion Support Subsidy at any one time is limited to no more than 10 percent of the service's approved child care places.The provision of specialist disability services and medical services is the responsibility of the state and territory governments. This includes specialised services such as early intervention programmes, special schooling, accommodation, intensive therapy programmes, and related services such as respite and day activities/excursions. The Australian Government makes a substantial contribution to these state responsibilities through the Commonwealth State and Territory Disability Agreements.The Australian government does not control staff wages which are typically set under state and territory awards.</DOC>

In accordance with the Legal Services Directions 2005 (the Directions), government agencies are generally required to engage the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) in matters involving national security.AGS will recommend counsel to the client based on availability, location, experience, cost, client preferences and, where appropriate, the level of clearance required. The agency is then responsible for the selection of the appropriate counsel from those recommendations, which will take into account agency obligations for the efficient, effective and ethical use of resources as prescribed by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act).Whilst the Directions do not apply to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) when conducting criminal prosecutions and related proceedings, the CDPP takes into account similar factors when briefing counsel, such as counsel's experience, expertise, availability, cost, views of the referring agencies and the level of security clearance required. The CDPP complies with the FMA Act.The level of security clearance required by each defence counsel depends on the highest classification of information the counsel is required to access throughout the proceedings. The agency from where the information originates determines the appropriate classification levels for information.For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the levels of clearance held by senior or junior external counsel acting on behalf of the government. Nor does the government comment on the numbers of clearance holders at each clearance level.The agency engaging the external counsel is responsible for sponsoring the security clearances of counsel. All national security clearances are processed in accordance with the Australian Government Protective Security Manual (PSM).The agency or agencies engaging the external counsel cover the clearance costs.he security clearance process is limited to counsel engaged or sponsored by a Commonwealth agency where the need for a clearance has been clearly identified. The Attorney - General's Department and other relevant agencies may sponsor defence counsel engaged by non-government entities in matters where national security information may be involved. The National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 also makes provision for clearing defence representatives in certain circumstances.In accordance with the PSM, security clearances may only be sought where the need for access to security classified resources is clearly established. The agency engaging or sponsoring the counsel determines that need for access and undertakes the relevant processes for the counsel to acquire the corresponding national security clearance level. The level of clearance requested is relative to the highest classification of the resources accessed by the counsel.The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 also defines and limits the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's (ASIO) security assessment functions to those required by Commonwealth agencies. The ASIO security assessment is a mandatory facet of the process to acquire a national security clearance.For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the length of time required to obtain a clearance.For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the numbers of applicants undergoing the security clearance process through Australian Government agencies.</DOC>

The Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies to proceedings in an Australian federal court. The relevant State and Territory evidence laws generally apply in State and Territory courts exercising federal jurisdiction.The rules on hearsay evidence for proceedings in an Australian federal court are contained in Part 3.2 of the Evidence Act. The Part establishes the general rule against the use of hearsay evidence and then sets out a number of specific exceptions to the rule.Generally, there is no requirement, in admitting hearsay evidence, for a court to require disclosure of the circumstances in which that evidence was obtained.However, the court may need to consider the circumstances in which the prior representation (the hearsay evidence) was made. For example, under subsection 65(2) of the Evidence Act, in a criminal proceeding where the person who made the representation is unavailable, the court is required to consider whether:the representation was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; orthe representation was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; orthe representation was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; orthe representation was against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made.Rulings on the admissibility of evidence are matters to be determined by the court.Part 3.11 of the Evidence Act gives the court discretion to exclude evidence even if that evidence would otherwise be admissible. This includes discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence.</DOC>

The selection and vetting process for Iraqi Security Forces is the remit of the sovereign Iraqi Government, in consultation with the Coalition.  The Australian Defence Force (ADF) does not play a role in vetting members of the Iraqi Security Forces.and (3) The Government agrees that, in taking responsibility for its country's security, the Iraqi Government must develop a comprehensive strategy and take robust action to combat militia activity.  The Australian Government has had ongoing discussions with, and has made representations to, the Iraqi Government on a range of matters, including security.The Australian Government is concerned by the violence being perpetrated against the Iraqi people.  Australia does not have a direct role in combating sectarian violence in Iraq.  Australia's contribution is supporting the Iraqi Government and Coalition by providing training and mentoring for the Iraqi Army and supporting the Iraqi authorities in Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar, where responsibility for security has transferred to Iraqi control.and (6) The Iraqi authorities have responsibility for security within Australia's area of operations.  Australia provides support to the Iraqi Security Forces in the area through the provision of training and mentoring.  I am not in a position to provide details of militia activities within the Australian area of responsibility in southern Iraq.Any Australian participation in security operations in southern Iraq would require Australian Government approval, following a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister.During a meeting with Iraqi officials in Al Muthanna province in September 2006 an attack occurred on elements of the Overwatch Battle Group (West) by elements of the anti-coalition forces.  Australian forces did not request assistance from Iraqi Security Forces. (a), (b) and (c) Not applicable.It was a matter for the Iraq Study Group as to who it wished to make submissions.  The Australian Government has regular and ongoing close discussions about Iraq with the United States Government and key Coalition partners.  The United States administration has made clear that the Iraq Study Group report was one of a number of inputs that fed into the Administration's review of strategy in Iraq.Australia has a detailed detention policy for the handling of any detainees, including any subsequent transfer, to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with Australian standards and international law.The legal basis for ADF involvement in operations in Iraq is twofold: authorisation under United Nations Security Council resolutions and the continuing consent of the Iraqi Government.  United Nations Security Council resolutions 1546 and 1723 authorise the Multi-National Force - Iraq to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq.  ADF members have immunity from Iraqi civil and criminal courts pursuant to Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17.  However, they remain subject to Australian domestic law, including the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982.Australia does not maintain any independent, unclassified, reporting on the issues detailed in this question.A stable and secure Iraq is in the interests of its neighbours and the region.</DOC>

Stocktaking of Australian Defence Force weapons occurs in accordance with the Defence Security Manual. Stocktakes are conducted on a fortnightly basis except for major base logistics weapons storage and repair facilities. These facilities undergo a complete 100 per cent stocktake on a three month cycle.At the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre, Joint Logistic Unit (South Queensland) and Joint Logistic Unit (West) a 100 per cent weapons stocktake is conducted every three months. The last completed Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre weapon stocktake cycle was completed on 31 March 2007.A National Weapon Census is undertaken annually in the May-June period by the Armaments Systems Programme Office within the Defence Materiel Organisation. The annual census is conducted in order to confirm the registered serial number of all small arms in the Defence inventory and ensures the integrity of data in the Standard Defence Supply System. The most recent National Weapon Census was completed on 31 May 2007.</DOC>

No, not at this stage. Australia and Indonesia do share a common interest in addressing maritime threats, including terrorism, piracy and illegal fishing. The Australian and Indonesian Governments are continuing to explore maritime cooperation between a number of agencies, including Defence.Australia has proposed conducting coordinated patrols with the Indonesian Navy. A coordinated patrol would see both navies exchanging information on patrol times and operating areas in order to maximise coverage. Coordinated patrols would seek to enhance our maritime surveillance efforts with Indonesia through effective scheduling of patrols and exchange of surveillance information.</DOC>

The Royal Australian Navy has operated gas turbine engines in the Adelaide Class Frigates (FFG) since 1980 and in the Anzac Class Frigates (FFH) since 1996. During this time records indicate that there have been two previous instances of a fire in the gas turbine module.The first occurred in HMAS Darwin in July 1991 and the second incident occurred in HMAS Melbourne in July 2003.Darwin: The Flame Detection Alarm activated and smoke was observed within the gas turbine module. The fire suppression system was activated. The fire was contained within the module and extinguished by the fire suppression system. Subsequent investigation identified the cause of fire to be a crack in the fuel manifold that had developed while the ship was underway, which allowed fuel to escape and accumulate on the module floor. The fuel subsequently ignited. Modification to all Royal Australian Navy gas turbine fuel manifolds and module drains has reduced the risk of a reoccurrence of this type of incident.Melbourne: The Flame Detection Alarm activated and smoke was observed within the gas turbine module. The fire suppression system was then activated. The fire was contained within the module and extinguished by the fire suppression system. An investigation identified the cause of the fire as fuel weeping from a joint in the engine's power turbine casing. The fuel subsequently ignited. On conclusion of the investigation, the weeping joint was repaired. No modifications to any system were necessary.No, it is not normal to experience a fire in a naval vessel. However, both engine and ship constructions are designed to deal with this type of incident. Additionally, crew members routinely practice proven standard operating procedures in order to handle these incidents.The fire's duration was less than three minutes. (b) A full investigation of the cause of the fire has not yet been completed. However, preliminary indications suggest the fire was caused by a very small quantity of undetected fuel in the right rear corner of the gas turbine module. The source of ignition is believed to have been the high ambient temperature in this rear 'exhaust' section of the gas turbine module. (c) The fire burnt for approximately two minutes prior to the activation of the fire suppression system. The Flame Detection Alarm was activated after the High Temperature Alarm was triggered. Release of fire suppressant occurred approximately one minute after activation of the Flame Detection Alarm and visual confirmation that no fire remained occurred approximately one minute later.There has never been a recorded failure during operation of a fire suppression system in this class of vessel in the Royal Australian Navy. That is, they have performed successfully when called upon. Time based maintenance is conducted on the systems to ensure operability. This maintenance has occasionally uncovered defects in fire suppression systems, which have then been rectified.Adelaide's fire suppression systems were most recently checked during the period January  -  February 2007.The gas turbine enclosure is serviced by two halon fire suppression systems, primary and reserve. In the event of the primary system failing, the reserve system would be activated. Both systems are identical in fire suppression capability.In the event of the halon system failing in total, the fire would be contained within the enclosure that is specifically designed to contain a fire of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of greater than 15 minutes. The module design allows for all services (fuel, air, lubricants, drains, and electricity) to be isolated and the enclosure to be boundary cooled until the fire has been starved. This procedure is practised regularly by crew members.Wherever there is abundant fuel, air (oxygen) and heat, there is a residual risk of fire and explosion. In none of the reported cases of fire in Royal Australian Navy FFG gas turbine engine modules, however, has there been an explosion. Royal Australian Navy regulations strictly prohibit the use of high volatility fuels in marine propulsion systems in order to reduce the risk of fire and explosion. The Royal Australian Navy FFG gas turbine engines use diesel and diesel derivative fuels of low volatility. The FFG gas turbine engine and module systems are designed to reduce the probability of fire and explosion to a very low level. Further, the engine and modules are designed to contain fire should it occur. The likelihood of explosion damage beyond the module internals is also very low because any pressure build up would be released up through the engine and module exhaust system. Continuous monitoring and fire detection and suppression systems (with dual redundancy) are fitted to enable rapid identification and suppression of any fire. The Royal Australian Navy has never recorded an instance of an explosion in a gas turbine engine module.</DOC>

Defence has never made a formal request to acquire the F-22 Raptor as Defence analysis shows that the F-22 is not the preferred air combat solution for Australia. US Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr Gordon England recently wrote to me reaffirming that the F-22 was not available for export at this time. Mr England's letter was in response to my letter advising the US Government that Australia had decided to join the Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development phase of the Joint Strike Fighter Program.</DOC>

Financial Assistance Schemes
My Department administers a number of schemes for the provision of financial assistance for legal and associated costs. These schemes exist to provide legal or financial assistance in cases where legal aid is not generally available from legal aid commissions and where the circumstances give rise to a special Commonwealth interest. People and organisations in the electoral division of Ballarat can apply for assistance directly from the Australian Government under these schemes. In order to comply with obligations imposed by the Privacy Act 1988 and to protect applicant information which would be subject to solicitor/client confidentiality, it has been a long-standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence and not to provide information in relation to individual applications.

It has been my longstanding practice not to comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.It has been my longstanding practice not to comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.Whether an allowance or payment paid to clerics by embassies, or other diplomatic missions is taxable or not, depends on the nature of the allowance in the hands of the recipient.        An allowance received in relation to activities arising from the cleric's office, occupation, services rendered or to be rendered, would be taxable.        An allowance received by a cleric for personal reasons, not related to any income-producing activity on their part, would not be taxable.No.The ATO is unable to determine a taxpayer's religious affiliations from data provided in tax returns.        The ATO uses accepted Australian Bureau of Statistics definitions in its occupation coding system. In this system there is no association made between the occupation 'religious leader' and the particular religion.Although it may be possible to identify payments made by particular persons, it is not possible to determine the nature of the services that gave rise to those payments.</DOC>

No. The BSE side letter to the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) signed by my predecessor commits Australia and the United States to cooperate in international forums, such as Codex Alimentarius and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), to secure science-based standards for food safety and animal health-related BSE risks. Australia, the United States and a number of other trading partners were cooperating on BSE matters in these and other forums prior to AUSFTA.Following the decision by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), at its General Session on 21-25 May 2007, to classify the United States as a 'controlled risk' country for BSE, the Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced it would negotiate with the United States on the revision of ROK beef import protocols, but would also conduct its own import risk assessment to reduce public concerns on food safety.  Separate to the OIE decision, there has been extensive media reporting that US beef is in the process of re-entering the ROK market under the existing protocols.Australia has the sovereign right to set its own food safety standards, including for BSE. Under Australia's policy for the safety of imported food, imports of beef and beef products produced on or after the date a country reports an indigenous case of BSE are prohibited.</DOC>

The last round of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue saw a constructive exchange on human rights issues. Australia raised the full range of our concerns, including freedom of expression, press freedom, religious freedom, treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, the death penalty, re-education through labour, and the situations in Tibet and Xinjiang. The 2006 round of Dialogue saw the inclusion of eight Chinese organisations and direct contact between the Australian Non-Government Organisation community and senior Chinese officials. In addition, Australia and China agreed on activities to be conducted in the 2006/07 financial year under the Human Rights and Technical Cooperation Program, which will total $A2 million in value.It is not possible to pinpoint specific steps China has taken in the human rights field as a result of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue alone. Human rights improvements are often the result of diverse developments and pressures. Australia's efforts, along with those of like-minded countries, and the contributions of NGOs and individuals in China and abroad, continue to have a cumulative effect in encouraging improvements in human rights in China. Chinese human rights activists have told us that they support human rights dialogues because they maintain international pressure on the Chinese Government. The growth in representation of Chinese agencies in the Dialogue exposes a wide range of Chinese officials to Australia's concerns about human rights in China, and our approach to human rights issues.Following the 2006 Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, Australia agreed to undertake the following projects in 2006/07 under the Human Rights and Technical Cooperation Program:- Masters level scholarships for two officials from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study in human rights related disciplines in Australia.- A seminar, to be held in China in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to examine practical measures to promote the application of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).- A seminar, to be held in China in conjunction with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, to examine procedures and practices which protect the rights of juveniles in the criminal justice system.- A study visit to Australia by the Supreme People's Procurate to study how Australian agencies, laws, policies and practices combat corruption consistent with the protection and promotion of human rights.- A study visit to Australia, followed by a seminar in China, with the Ministry of Public Security to examine Australia's practices relating to the rights of detainees.- A workshop to be held in China to share Australian approaches to juvenile justice with a broad range of officials, likely to include members of Juvenile Tribunals, Supreme People's Court legislative policy officers and officials from the Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs.- A model United Nations Human Rights Council to be held in China in conjunction with the United Nations Association of China, to debate themes related to the ICESCR and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.- A Human Rights Knowledge Competition, to be published in the China Youth Daily and on its website, to contribute to broader public education program on human rights by the United Nations Association of China.- A study visit to Australia by the Ministry of Justice to examine Australian legislation, policy and programs designed to promote the re-integration of former prisoners in the community.- A study visit to Australia by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to examine the structure of specialist Australian NGOs and their role in the protection of human rights.- A visit by two Australian experts to China to assist the Beijing Legal Aid Office of Rural Migrants in the design and implementation of a training activity for lawyers and administrators providing legal services for rural migrant workers.- A research seminar to be held in China in conjunction with the National Judges College, to share information with a range of officials on the role and involvement of non-judicial actors in Australia's judicial processes.- A workshop to be held in China on combating domestic violence, with an emphasis on the role of the courts. Participants will include the All China Women's Federation and local women's federation, judicial departments, public security bureaus and civil affairs.- A workshop to be held in China to provide representatives of coordination groups on safeguarding women and children's rights with training on human rights and gender awareness.- A training program in China for family planning officials on applying human rights based approaches in the delivery of family planning and reproductive health services.- A training program in China for family planning officials to assist them in applying human rights principles in training, information and education programs and in methods for providing advice and communication with clients.- A study tour to Australia by the Public Security Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region to examine the Australian experience in detention and the laws, policies and programs designed to promote the human rights of detainees.- A study tour to Australia by the Department of Justice of the Tibet Autonomous Region to examine the Australian experience in promoting the re-integration of prisoners into the community.The next Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue will take place in China in July 2007.The Agenda for the Dialogue is currently under discussion with the Chinese Government.</DOC>

Comprehensive information that covers all individual programmes or COPOs across portfolios, identifying the specific Wage Cost Indexes (WCIs) and their weightings applied to individual programmes or COPOs, is programme information for the internal use of the government and is not publicly released.and (3) Increases in individual programme or COPO expenditures arising from indexation is internal programme information and is not publicly released.The absence of Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) SNA decisions means that they are not available as a component of the WCIs. The Government decided in May 2006 that the wage component of the WCIs would instead be based on the Australian Fair Pay Commission's (AFPC's) minimum wage decision, as this decision will give the measure of wages growth that most closely corresponds to the AIRC's SNA decision.As in previous budgets, the 2006 - 07 budget estimates included indexation of funding based on wage and price parameters. For the purposes of indexation in the 2006-07 Budget, it was assumed that the minimum wage movement is equivalent to that from the AIRC SNA decision of June 2005, which granted an increase of $17 per week (across the pay scales).On 26 October 2006, the AFPC determined that minimum wages across pay scales will rise by $27.36 per week for pay scales up to $700 per week, and by $22.04 per week for pay scales above $700 per week. The increases were effective from 1 December 2006. This decision explicitly took into account the period since the last AIRC SNA (June 2005).The AFPC's October 2006 decision translated to an annual movement in minimum wages equivalent to that assumed in the 2006-07 Budget. In effect, the AFPC's decision was factored into the expenditure estimates for 2006-07 and the forward years.The next decision of the AFPC is expected in mid-2007. In line with the practice of previous budgets, the indexation included in the 2007-08 Budget was based on the assumption that the annual minimum wage movement will be equivalent to that in the October 2006 AFPC decision.</DOC>

There were no unsuccessful state government schools in the electorate of Hindmarsh in Round One of the 2005 Investing in Our Schools Programme (IOSP).A total of 19 state government schools from the electorate of Hindmarsh applied for funding for a total of 27 projects under Round Two of the 2005 IOSP. However, seven of these schools with a total number of 10 projects did not receive funding under Round Two of IOSP.        It is inappropriate to publicly disclose details of unsuccessful applications. Such disclosure may have an adverse affect on schools' reputation in their local communities.As per questions 1(a) and 1(b), a total of seven state government schools were unsuccessful in the electorate of Hindmarsh in Rounds One and Two of the 2005 IOSP. These seven schools were all unsuccessful in Round Two of the Programme.As stated in (1) (a) all the state government schools from the electorate of Hindmarsh that applied for funding in Round One of 2005 IOSP were successful. Therefore, no requests for advice or clarification of the rules were received.See 1(a)Advice is provided to all successful and unsuccessful applicants.I cannot guarantee that a school will receive funding. For applications which are deemed 'Not recommended' by the State-based Assessment Advisory Panel (SAAP), school communities would need to resubmit applications in a subsequent funding Round. The SAAPs comprise a combination of parent and principal representatives who receive technical advice from a State Government Advisor (SGA) and convene at meetings to make recommendations to the Australian Government of projects for consideration and approval. I make my decision shortly after receiving the SAAP recommendations.        Funding allocated under the IOSP occurs on a competitive basis. For the purpose of allocating funds, I may approve funding for government school projects within a state according to an order of merit determined by the independent SAAP, until funds are exhausted for that round.</DOC>

DFAT
Common branding for Australian Government departments and agencies was introduced in June 2003 and coordinated by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.One.The common brand was introduced to improve recognition of the many policy initiatives, programmes and financial services delivered across the Australian Government.The total cost of the change to the logo for the department was minimal. Implementation of common branding took place over many months and any additional costs that might be attributable to the change were not separately identified in the department's administrative expenditure. Costs associated with changes to signage were minor. Stationery stocks were allowed to run down before new orders were placed. No advertising was undertaken by the department to introduce the new logo. The new logo was introduced to the department's website in a redesign carried out internally as part of ongoing development. The resources required to search for and identify the costs attributable to branding cannot be justified as it would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources.

See (a) above.The common brand was introduced to improve recognition of the many policy initiatives, programmes and financial services delivered across the Australian Government.The cost of the logo change is approximately $4,730.$3,180 for building signage and marketing material.Costs for changing stationery have been negligible, approximately $1,000, as Finance's letterheads are largely template-based, not pre-printed. Once existing stocks of printed materials, such as envelopes and business cards with the old logo were exhausted, replacement stocks with the new logos were ordered.Nil.$550 for logos on the Finance internet site.
Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)
A new AEC logo was announced in November 2006.One. See (a) above. The AEC is exempt from the common branding.As part of significant organisational renewal, the AEC is updating its corporate look and feel, and will progressively roll out the new logo in 2007. This will be in conjunction with the AEC's new communication strategy, with revision or development of AEC products and publications related to amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 made in both 2006 and 2007.Total cost of the logo change as at 23 February 2007 is $73,821. This expenditure relates specifically to logo design, market testing, graphic design and style guide development. As per (c) above, the logo change is being rolled out progressively as new communication products are developed and stocks of existing ongoing products require replenishment.Nil. It is expected that most AEC shopfronts will carry the new logo by the end of 2007. This will be undertaken as part of an overall review of AEC office signage.Nil. The additional cost is expected to be minimal. Stationery and forms templates will be updated electronically. The new logo will be included in the new enrolment forms required for the introduction of the new Proof of Identity requirements that will commence from 16 April 2007. The logo will be applied to other stationery as stocks require replenishment.Nil.Nil. The new logo will be incorporated in a planned redevelopment of the AEC website which is currently underway.

 Approximately $10,000 to change internal and external building signage.2003: The change occurred at the time when the current office premises, Unit 4 Cameron Offices, was being refurbished and therefore, the cost of the internal and external building logos was incorporated as part of the construction cost. ComSuper is unable to divert the intensive resources required to identify the included signage cost component.The cost associated with changing stationery was minimal as stationery is ordered on a just-in-time basis as reflected in the management reports for the years in question. There was a minimal cost to update general stationery such as envelopes, letter heads, and business cards utilised for every day use. The estimated cost is approximately $5,000 for each change.2002: Nil.2003: Nil.2002: Nil.2003: Nil.

The only change to the Department's logo has been the introduction of the common branding for Australian Government departments and agencies which was introduced in June 2003 and coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.Tourism Australia changes occurred on 1 July 2004, when Tourism Australia was established, bringing together the functions of international marketing (the Australian Tourist Commission), domestic tourism marketing (See Australia) and tourism research (the Bureau of Tourism Research and Tourism Forecasting Council).The only change for the Department has been the common branding for the Australian Government departments and agencies.The Australian Tourist Commission did not change its logo over the period specified prior to the establishment of Tourism Australia on 1 July 2004.The common brand was introduced to improve recognition of the many policy initiatives, programmes and financial services delivered across the Australian Government.The reason for the Tourism Australia change was the establishment of a new entity as recommended by the Australian Government's Tourism White Paper A Medium to Long Term Strategy for Tourism which was issued in November 2003.The Department had no additional costs incurred as old stocks were used until they were finished. The new logo replaced the old in the production of new stock.The following administrative costs were incurred by agencies:

Signage  -  $4,540 to refurbish signage at Geoscience Australia Building, Symonston (this includes removal of logo, repair and refurbishment of concrete pillar, installation of new 'Coat of Arms' sign) in September 2003; $1,958 for installation of new signs at Map Warehouse, Fyshwick in December 2003; andStationery  -  $7,000 (estimated) for new business cards.

Legal fees for the purchase and registration of the corporate name and the performance of due diligence  -  $367,000;Trade mark registrations  -  $135,000;Recruitment  -  $122,000;Stationery  -  $107,000;Consultancy for the establishment of systems, processes and related documentation  -  $208,000; andOther miscellaneous costs  -  $83,000.The initial development costs for the new Tourism Australia identity and Brand Australia identity, which included all corporate and consumer facing materials was $312,000.

 The IP Australia organisation descriptor was changed in 2005 to include Plant Breeder's Rights. This resulted in a change of building signage in April 2006 at a total cost of $18,630.</DOC>

Anti-fraud measures have been introduced by successive governments. These include, but are not limited to, data-matching, targeted field investigations, publicity campaigns and Tip-off facilities. These measures remain in place until they are rescinded or lapse. As successive governments become aware of possible weaknesses in the system, new measures are introduced.Data reporting systems are not designed in a way that allows retrieval of information for all publicly announced anti-fraud measures and programmes. In addition, the results of many of these measures are likely to be underestimated as it is difficult to quantify the deterrent effect of many preventative measures that are in place.Any prospective anti-fraud measures would be brought forward for Cabinet's consideration and be subject to the normal Cabinet-In-Confidence provisions.</DOC>

On 6 December 2006, I advised that I had approved Rules of Engagement for use by the Royal Australian Navy during maritime border protection operations. No new legislative powers were announced at that time. These rules of engagement enable ADF members to counter non-compliant behaviour by foreign fishing vessel crews, specifically those foreign fishing vessels within the Australian Fisheries Zone.The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) adjacent to the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT) is not part of the Australian Fisheries Zone but is by definition within the Australian Whale Sanctuary in accordance with section 225 of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. There are, however, a number of issues that affect our ability to take enforcement action within the waters of the AAT EEZ.Any activities conducted must be consistent with Australia's obligations under the Antarctic treaty, which includes a prohibition on any measures of a military nature.Japan's whaling activities in the Southern Ocean, including at times in waters off the AAT within the AAT EEZ, raise unique international legal issues. Due to the special legal and political status of Antarctica under the long standing Antarctic Treaty system, it is for the Government of Japan to regulate the activities of its nationals in Antarctic waters. Enforcement action in those waters risks undermining important cooperation over the rest of the Antarctic.Japan regards these waters as the high seas and not subject to the jurisdiction of any nation. Action against Japanese vessels engaged in whaling, in what we regard as Australian Antarctic waters, may also have serious implications for the Antarctic Treaty system and Australia's long-term interests in the region. Further, although we find it objectionable, scientific whaling is permissible under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Provocative action, such as taking enforcement action against Japanese whaling vessels, may only serve to make resolution of this issue more difficult.I note that there are fundamental differences between regulating Japan's scientific whaling in Antarctica and illegal fishing in Australian waters. Illegal fishing and whaling are managed under different international legal regimes and involve different factual and legal contexts.</DOC>

I have not held discussions with the Chinese Government regarding Chinese aid practices in Sudan specifically, although I regularly raise issues of good aid practices with my Chinese counterparts, and my Department does the same at officials' level. Australia has urged China to adhere more closely to international best practice in aid delivery, including the OECD's 'do no harm principle'.Australia's aid program supports the advancement of human rights. It is a matter for other sovereign governments as to the objectives pursued through their aid program, in accordance with applicable international and domestic law.No.Australia supports efforts to build a stronger peacekeeping mission in Darfur, and we have made these views known at senior levels to the Government of Sudan, and will continue to do so. We have also made representations to key members of the African Union and the Arab League asking them to encourage Sudan to agree to the deployment of an international force.</DOC>

The private financing contract with Praeco Pty Ltd (a consortium comprising Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd and ABN AMRO Australia Limited) calls for the construction of the Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) by Praeco Pty Ltd to be complete in July 2008. Praeco advises that construction is scheduled to meet this milestone. Photos of construction can be viewed on the Project's internet site at http://www.defence.gov.au/id/hqjoc.        Construction of the facility will be followed by the installation by Defence of command, control, communications, computing and intelligence systems. The movement of staff into the facility is programmed from November 2008.        The Project will be complete once the facility becomes operational following staff transition and assimilation. It is anticipated that the Project Team will not stand down until all the administrative aspects of the Project are completed in the first half of 2009.The new Headquarters facility is designed to provide normal working arrangements for approximately 750 Defence staff, noting that some of these staff will be shift workers. In addition to these Defence personnel, Praeco Pty Ltd has estimated that there could be about 40 to 50 of their staff employed in facilities management roles as part of the 30 year private financing arrangement.        The car park on the HQJOC site is designed to cater for 700 private vehicles, 20 Commonwealth vehicles in undercover parking, and a further 25 spaces for motorcycles. In addition, provision is made for VIP/executive vehicle parking for 10 vehicles in a separate car park.The Department of Defence through the HQJOC Project commissioned a traffic study into the Kings Highway which was included as a report in the Project's Environmental Impact Statement (2003 draft report and 2005 final report). That study used the original 1,185 Defence staff numbers for the HQJOC facility which was subsequently reduced in late 2005. The Project has commissioned another traffic study which will use the reduced Defence staff numbers, and include contractor site support staff. The results of this study will be available later this year and are required to be presented to Government as part of the environmental conditions of approval for the Project. The traffic study results will also be released to the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority and Roads ACT.        The Commonwealth's position regarding funding for upgrades to local roads remains as that provided in the February 2006 Estimates Hearing, that is, it is principally a state and local government responsibility.</DOC>

The Australian Government does not set targets for participation in higher education. However recently published findings from the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth (LSAY) show that 49% of young people in the study had attended university by the age of 24.Attainment rates in higher education in Australia are above average by international standards. According to figures published in Education at a Glance, 2006, Australia had the sixth highest attainment rate for 'Type A' tertiary education (closest equivalent to our higher education) out of thirty OECD countries in 2003. Australia outperformed the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan.The Australian Government's reforms to the system have contributed to increased participation. There were 717,000 domestic students at Australian universities in 2005. Domestic undergraduate commencements rose 6% in 2005. Commonwealth supported students make up about 97% of all domestic undergraduate students in public universities.The Australian Government is providing funds for an additional 50,000 new Commonwealth-supported university places by 2011 through the Backing Australia's Future reforms and other initiatives. This will further increase opportunities for university study, especially in areas of skills shortage.Universities Australia released its report on unmet demand (Report on Applications for Undergraduate University Courses 2007) on 26 April 2007. Universities Australia estimates that unmet demand for undergraduate university places has fallen by 7% this year, from 14,200 in 2006 to 13,200 in 2007. Unmet demand has fallen 63% since the peak in 2004 and is now lower than it has been at any time since 2001 (2001 is the first year of the current time series for unmet demand due to a change in methodology by the Universities Australia).This year, 92% of eligible Year 12 applicants who applied for an undergraduate place in their home state received an offer of a place. This is the highest figure on record.In January this year, Professor Gerard Sutton, Chair of Universities Australia, stated that 'this government have put in enough new places to effectively cancel any unmet demand _ effectively, nation wide, unmet demand no longer exists'.Research has found that the main reason most students miss out on a place is their tertiary entrance performance. Year 12 applicants who missed out on a place had an average ENTER score of about 54 (Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth, Research Report 46).Australia's student financing system is internationally recognised as fair and equitable. The income contingent repayment arrangements under HECS-HELP ensure that students are not prevented from participating in higher education if they are unable to pay their student contributions up - front.In addition, the Australian Government is committing more than $400 million over 5 years to 2009 through more than 43,000 Commonwealth Learning Scholarships to assist students from low socio-economic backgrounds.</DOC>

Telstra has advised that telecommunications services in Far North Queensland are subject to difficulties due to seasonal variation, in addition to natural disasters such as Cyclone Larry. For example, the dry season may cause cracks in cables, which are then penetrated by moisture in the wet season, causing faults in service provision. Telstra has advised that it has a program for replacement and/or upgrade where the network is performing below expectation.The Government has put in place the Network Reliability Framework (NRF) to monitor and improve the reliability of telephone services provided by Telstra, both in regional and metropolitan areas. The NRF came into effect on 1 January 2003 and requires Telstra to meet reliability standards, particularly in relation to multiple faults, for its seven million residential and small business customers.The NRF works at three distinct levels  -  the regional, local and individual service levels. Under the NRF, Telstra is legally required to report regularly to ACMA on regional performance and to fix poorly performing local areas and individual services.On 12 September 2006, amendments were made to Telstra's carrier licence conditions to strengthen the NRF so that recurrent faults in Telstra's network are fixed more effectively and efficiently.At the local level, Telstra is now required to automatically remediate at least 480 of the worst performing cable runs each year, with minimum quotas for smaller exchange areas which are mostly in regional areas. Remediation here means more than just normal repair work  -  it must also address the root cause of recurrent problems with a view to eliminating them. To assess Telstra's success with this, its remediation activity on a cable run must result in a minimum 90 per cent reduction in the number of faults, otherwise it will be required to do further investigation and remediation.At the individual service level, Telstra must take action to prevent an individual service from experiencing more than three faults in a 60 day period or more than four faults in a 365 day period. If these faults levels are exceeded, Telstra must investigate and remediate the service, subject to supervision by ACMA. The new arrangements have improved the post-remediation monitoring arrangements for individual services, to ensure that recurrent and post-remediation faults are effectively targeted and promptly fixed.Satellite phones are a good means of mobile communication in areas of Australia where terrestrial mobile phone services are not available. Satellite phones work across 100 per cent of the Australian landmass and external territories  -  however, the user must have a clear unobstructed view of the sky. The reliability of the coverage from any one service provider is dependant on the reliability of the service provider's network of satellites, which is very much the commercial responsibility of the service provider.The Minister is aware that satellite mobile phone handsets are more expensive than other mobile phone handsets. It is for this reason that the Government put in place the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme to make mobile communications more accessible and affordable for people living or working in the most remote parts of Australia.Since the Scheme's inception in 2002, funding of more than $10.5 million has supported the purchase of almost 9000 phones by Australians living or working in rural, regional and remote areas. Under Mobile Connect, this Scheme has received additional funding and has now been extended to June 2009 to enable even more people living in remote areas to benefit.The operation of the Scheme has added to volumes in the satellite phone market and coincided with a reduction in satellite phone operating costs. It is expected that the market will continue to grow and competition increase over the life of the Scheme.The Government is aware of the growing importance of mobile telephony to Australians  -  because of the financial and social benefits, as well as for personal safety. It was for this reason that the Government has made around $175 million available since 1998 to further extend mobile phone coverage and to implement the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme to make satellite mobile handsets more affordable.While terrestrial mobile phones and satellite phones are an excellent means of communication, they would not be able to provide assistance in all emergency situations. Where a need exists for emergency communications that are not reliant on fixed or mobile phone services, the use of a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB), an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) or an Emergency Position Indicator Radio Beacon (EPIRB) is recommended. The Australian Government operates the Rescue Coordination Centre within the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to coordinate the response to emergency situations notified via a PLB, ELT or EPIRB. While these units need to be purchased, there are no monthly call charges.The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that those living in regional, rural and remote Australia continue to receive improvements to their telecommunications services, and has put in place a number of initiatives to achieve this outcome.On 17 August 2005, the Government announced communications initiatives totalling $1.1 billion, including $30 million for the Mobile Connect initiative to extend terrestrial mobile phone coverage in regional and rural areas and to continue satellite handset subsidies for more remote areas.Under the Mobile Connect initiative, mobile phone coverage will be extended in smaller regional communities and along highways where a case for strategic location or economic importance can be established and where services will have ongoing commercial viability.While the use of a car-kit will extend the range where terrestrial mobile phone signals can be received, the sparse population and difficult terrain makes it difficult to establish the business case to substantially increase terrestrial coverage in this region. In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite.People living in areas that do not receive terrestrial mobile phone coverage may wish to consider purchasing a satellite mobile phone, particularly as they may be eligible for assistance under the Government's Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme.This Scheme has been extended until June 2009 as part of the Mobile Connect initiative. During 2006 - 07, this subsidy is improving affordability by providing up to $1200 towards the cost of a satellite phone handset to eligible people who live or operate a business in an area without terrestrial mobile phone coverage, and up to $900 to other eligible people if they spend significant time in such areas. As such, the subsidy represents a potential discount of around 60 per cent on the cost of a typical satellite phone handset.Additionally, the $2 billion Communications Fund was established by legislation in 2005 to ensure that regional, rural and remote Australia's future telecommunications needs are secured. It forms part of the Government's ongoing commitment to continuing improvements in telecommunications in regional, rural and remote Australia.The Communications Fund has been invested to provide an ongoing income stream which is projected to reach approximately $400 million every three years and can only be spent implementing the recommendations of the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee.The Government will shortly announce the formation of the first independent Review Committee with the inquiry to get underway this year and subsequent reviews every three and a half years thereafter.These arrangements will assist services to keep pace with those in other parts of the country and provide a level of certainty for regional, rural and remote Australia into the future.</DOC>

Yes.The overwhelming positive response to IOSP in its first year of implementation demonstrates how successful the Australian Government has been in responding to the needs of school communities. This high demand from school communities led to the 2008 Programme year funding being brought forward into the 2006 Programme year. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together  -  Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 was amended by Parliament in April 2006 to facilitate this reposition. In February 2007, the Australian Government announced a further $127 million would be made available to allow state government schools that have received grants below $100,000 or none at all to apply for funding grants.It has never been stated in any Programme Guidelines that funding application periods will be open up until the end of 2008.The Investing in Our Schools Programme does not absolve state governments of their responsibility to properly fund schools which they own and manage.While the funding limit for any one school was nominally $150,000 over the life of the Programme, there was never any guarantee that every state government school would receive this amount. It is a competitive grant programme. Given there are around 7,000 state government schools and the initial IOSP funding pool for these schools was $700 million, the average total grant was inherently going to be $100,000. Of the original $700 million funding allocated to state government schools, the Investing in Our Schools Programme has already expended $656.2 million on more than 15,100 projects in 6,166 state government schools across Australia. Already around 90% of state government schools have been successful in receiving funding from the Programme. Due to the success of the Investing in Our Schools Programme, an additional $127 million has been committed for state government schools, bringing the total funding to $827 million. This additional funding ensures that school communities which have received little or no funding to date will be able to benefit from the Investing in Our Schools Programme.</DOC>

In both roles, Finance is seeking to monitor energy and water use more accurately, and reduce consumption as far as possible.Measures instigated since 1 July 2000 to reduce water usage include:waterless urinals systems are currently on trial;progressive installation of water flow control fittings in taps and showers;installation of dripper systems with timers for the four small irrigated courtyards;use of dual flush toilets;installation of water meters on cooling towers and data logger water meters on mains supply lines; andregular checks of storm water drains, toilets, taps and pressure relief valves on hot water systems for leaks and the routine periodic changing of seals.Measures instigated since 1 July 2000 to reduce electricity usage include:timed after hours air-conditioning activation switches;movement activated sensor lighting and computer controlled lighting;staff are encouraged to turn off monitors and log off computers daily, and shut down computers over weekends;consideration of energy efficiency when purchasing items such as whitegoods and office machines for use in Finance tenancies; anda Christmas shutdown with a flow on effect of reduction in energy consumption over that period.</DOC>

Yes.Previous years' Programme Guidelines have stated that the limit for funding in respect of any one school is $150,000. It has further been stated that this may comprise of a number of smaller applications. It has never been stated in any Programme Guidelines that schools may apply for projects up until the end of 2008.The broad intention of the Investing in Our Schools Programme in respect of distributing funding was to provide $700 million to assist state government school communities deliver small infrastructure projects. To this end, some 15,100 projects have already been approved to 6,166 (or over 90 percent) of state government school communities.This high demand from school communities led to the 2008 Programme year funding being brought forward into the 2006 Programme year. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together  -  Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 was amended by Parliament in April 2006 to facilitate this reposition. In February 2007, the Australian Government announced a further $127 million would be made available to allow state government schools that have received grants below $100,000 or none at all to apply for funding grants.The funding limit of $100,000 as stated in the 2007 Programme Guidelines will ensure a wider distribution of this new funding.Under the IOSP, school communities apply directly to the Australian Government for funding discrete, small infrastructure projects. Applications are submitted within the Programme Guidelines of each funding round and each application is assessed on its own merits in a competitive process that takes into account the relative needs and risks of each project applied for. It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. It is a competitive grant programme.See answer for Question 3, above.</DOC>

Yes.While the funding limit for any one school was nominally $150,000 over the life of the Programme, there was never enough funding available for every state government school to receive the maximum amount. Given that this is a competitive grants programme and that there are around 7,000 state government schools and the initial IOSP funding pool for these schools was $700 million, the average total grant was inherently going to be $100,000. For the 2007 Round, the funding limit was $100,000 to ensure the widest distribution of the remaining funding.Under the IOSP, school communities apply directly to the Australian Government for funding discrete, small infrastructure projects. Applications are submitted within the Programme Guidelines of each funding round and each application is assessed on its own merits in a competitive process that takes into account the relative needs and risks of each project applied for. It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. It is a competitive grants programme.See answer to Question 3, above.Already 90% of state government schools have been successful under the Programme. The Australian Government has decided to introduce the limit of $100,000 for state government schools to ensure the widest distribution of remaining funding can be targeted at those schools which have either not applied for funding or which have received less than $100,000 in funding.Due to the success of the IOSP, an additional $127 million has been committed to state government schools, bringing the total to $827 million for state government schools.</DOC>

Yes.SBS has the following guidelines for encouraging Indigenous content:The SBS Charter as outlined in Section 6 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 states that SBS, in performing its principal function must contribute to meeting the needs of Australia's multicultural society, including ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.SBS Independent (SBSi) administers the Special Production Fund, funded by the Federal Government, for the development and commissioning of quality Australian projects from independent filmmakers. The SBSi principles guiding the selection of projects notes that the Special Production Fund be applied to, amongst other things, Indigenous programming.SBSi acknowledges, through its choice of projects, the on-going need to support new Australian talent (both on and off screen) from non-English speaking backgrounds, and to support program production from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island filmmakers, in alignment with the SBS Charter.SBSi expects filmmakers to be guided by the protocols described in the SBS guides 'The Greater Perspective, Protocol and Guidelines for the production of Film and Television on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities' and 'Indigenous Protocol'.No. However, since the establishment of the Fund, SBSi has consistently allocated over 30% of funding to projects featuring either Indigenous themes or Indigenous creative principles.SBS provides three hours per week of Indigenous programming through its Aboriginal radio program.SBS employs approximately 874 (full-time, part-time or casual) persons, of which 13 identified as being Indigenous.SBS is currently in the process of developing a new Indigenous employment strategy. SBS has also recently approved the establishment of an SBS Indigenous cadetship within its News and Current Affairs Division, to begin in 2008, and is currently in discussions with universities and tertiary institutions on ways of attracting Indigenous journalism students to the SBS Cadetship.</DOC>

Under the 2007 Programme Guidelines, state government schools may apply for project grants that take their school's total IOSP funding up to a maximum of $100,000.Yes.All state government school communities, regardless of their IOSP funding profile, were sent a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary shortly after the IOSP funding extension was announced, advising of the upcoming 2007 Programme.It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. The Programme Guidelines did not guarantee that all schools would receive the maximum amount. It is a competitive grant programme.See answer for Question 4, above.The Investing in Our Schools Programme allows school communities to decide which projects are important to their educational needs. These project applications are then assessed by an independent State-based Assessment and Advisory Panel (SAAP) comprising parents and schools principals, who rank the projects on a numerical scale and make recommendations to the Minister. The SAAP assesses each application on its own merits against key criteria such as the demonstrated education benefits of the project, as well as the capacity for the project to be completed within the budget defined in each application.No, see answer to Question 4.</DOC>

The Department of Transport and Regional Services administers airports subject to the Airports Act 1996, but Defence wishes to retain ownership and control of Avalon Airport as it may be of strategic interest.</DOC>

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has provided the following information:The AEC estimates that at 31 March 2007 the percentages are:77 per cent.35 per cent.410,000 estimated as at 31 March 2007. There is no significant discrepancy between this figure and that for the State/Territory rolls because under the joint roll arrangements the rolls are essentially the same.The number of people who enrolled or changed their enrolment details during the period from the issue of the writ to the close of rolls for the 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2004 Federal Elections is 428 694, 351 913, 369 966, and 408 770 respectively.136 023.The AEC is undertaking a number of activities to encourage eligible electors to enrol or update their enrolment details before the next federal election is called, including:- continuing its ongoing Continuous Roll Update programs, including a major national fieldwork program from March into June 2007 specifically targeting about 1.8 million people whom the AEC believes have moved but not updated their enrolment.- continuing enrolment drives at citizenship ceremonies, including the arrangement of providing pre-filled enrolment forms and following up new citizens who have not enrolled at citizenship ceremonies.- implementing a comprehensive communication strategy involving a mixture of advertising, public relations, and Internet and print products to inform the community about the changes to electoral law and to promote enrolment. There is a strong focus on young people, and major activities included:the Rock Enrol promotion from December 2006 to February 2007 which involved an on-air triple j and internet competition, and signage and roving enrolment teams at the five Big Day Out Concerts;O-Week enrolment promotions at university and other tertiary campuses throughout Australia during orientation weeks in February and March 2007;a national press advertising and media campaign conducted to advise all eligible electors of the 16 April 2007 commencement of the new proof of identity requirements for enrolment;a major national enrolment advertising campaign from 27 May 2007 that will run initially for 6 weeks. The campaign includes television (free to air and pay television), cinema, newspapers (metropolitan, regional and rural), radio (including Radio for the Print Handicapped), out door and on-line advertising. The campaign involves three consecutive stages of advertisements, starting with the overarching theme of 'Your vote is a valuable thing'. The first stage, which runs for two weeks, highlights the value of voting while serving as a reminder that the federal election will occur this year. The second stage advertisement, which will run for the following two weeks, publicises that 'the rules have changed' for close of rolls deadlines and encourages people who are not enrolled or enrolled for their current address to grab an enrolment form today.The third stage advertisement highlights that not enrolling now might mean missing out on voting at the federal election, and this will run for the last two weeks. A further advertisement is targeted at people who have moved and not yet updated their enrolment address, this will run over both the second and third stages. The campaign will be tailored and translated for culturally and linguistically diverse audiences and Indigenous audiences. The press advertising will be translated into 20 languages and radio advertising into 26 languages as well as 11 Indigenous languages. Another round of the advertising campaign is planned for later in the year but this is dependent on the timing of the federal election;an SMS trial for requesting enrolment forms will begin on 10 June running for six weeks and will be promoted through the enrolment advertising campaign print advertising.from 28 May to 1 June 2007, a national Enrol to Vote Week was undertaken focussing on enrolling 17 and 18 year old students, with over 1750 secondary schools and colleges registered to participate; anda national birthday card program involving sending birthday cards to year 12 students (17 and 18 year olds) with an enrolment form, based on a successful Victorian Electoral Commission initiative, is being developed in conjunction with other State and Territory electoral authorities. This commenced roll out on 27 June 2007; andthe Community Education and Information Officer (CEIO) field program will commence in July and expects to visit around 600 Indigenous communities in remote areas to encourage enrolment and deliver electoral education.Whilst the AEC is doing what it can to encourage eligible electors to enrol or to update their enrolment before the federal election, ultimately the responsibility for this lies with the individual.to (8) The Proof of Identity (POI) requirements for enrolment commenced on 16 April 2007. Between 16 April 2007 and 31 May 2007 the AEC processed 299,263 POI enrolment forms. Of these:- 90.2 per cent of people provided a driver's licence number (five provided a passport number) (Part A evidence);- 9.2 per cent showed another of the acceptable POI documents to an authorised witness (Part B); and- 0.8 per cent had two people who know them witness their enrolment form (Part C).To date, the AEC has not received any reports of problems with people meeting the POI requirements for enrolment, and the level of enrolment forms received in the month after the introduction of POI was commensurate with that received in the month prior to its introduction. At this time it is too early to suggest that the AEC needs to put in place additional assistance for particular groups of people beyond its normal programs but the AEC will continue to monitor the situation carefully and respond as appropriate.</DOC>

Since 1996 the Government has committed $2.8 billion to address climate change. This includes measures to reduce emissions such as: the $500 million Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund; over $600 million to support the renewable energy industry; and international partnerships focused on practical action including the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate and the Australia-China Clean Coal Initiative.The Australian Government also acknowledges the need to prepare Australia for the impacts of climate change as outlined by the IPCC. For example the government recently announced it will spend $170 million dollars on adaptation research, through the Australia Centre for Climate Change Adaptation and a new CSIRO Climate Change Adaptation Flagship.The CSIRO have advised me that they have not made any recommendations on appropriate emission reduction targets for Australia.No.</DOC>

Yes, light from the sun, also known as solar radiation, can be absorbed by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO), but only after it has first reflected off the earth's surface. This is because reflection causes the wavelength of light to become longer, and longwave radiation (unlike shortwave radiation) is filtered by CO molecules in the air. In effect, this means that a fraction of the sun's energy is trapped by the CO in the atmosphere. Over time, the trapped energy causes the earth's climate to become gradually warmer. This is what is commonly referred to as 'global warming'.I am aware of the open letter from Mr Paul Brennan, Mr Richard Gibbs, Mr Alex Erskine, Mr Geoff Weir and Mr Saul Eslake published in the Australian Financial Review on 2 May 2007.The Government has undertaken a great deal of analysis on the economic costs of reducing greenhouse gases and on the impacts of climate change. Numerous reports on impacts and adaptation are available on the Australian Greenhouse Office website and economic studies have been completed by ABARE and others.The Stern report attempts to weigh the costs of climate change impacts against the costs of reducing emissions on a global scale. Determining costs of impacts and costs of emissions reductions at the country or regional level is much more complex. There is considerable uncertainty around costs of the technologies that will be needed to reduce emissions and this uncertainty becomes greater against long time horizons like out to 2050.Setting a long term goal for reducing emissions and implementing an emissions trading scheme will be one of the most important economic decisions Australia makes in the next decade. The Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard MP, announced on 3 June 2007 that Australia will move towards a domestic emissions trading system no later than 2012, and that the Government will set, in 2008, a long-term aspirational goal for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This target will be set after economic modelling has been undertaken, and following a very careful assessment of the impacts any target will have on Australia's economy and Australian families.</DOC>

Section 10 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 sets out the duties of the Board, which include developing codes of practice relating to programming matters; notifying the Codes to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA); and publicising the SBS's policies on the handling of complaints.The SBS Codes of Practice set the benchmark for SBS programming. They set out the principles and policies followed by SBS in fulfilling its Charter obligations to provide multicultural and multilingual programming to all Australians.Sections 150 to 153 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 set out the independent complaints process to which the SBS is subject. As with all other broadcasters, SBS must have had an opportunity to respond to programming complaints, prior to a complaint being referred to ACMA.Complaints about the SBS referred to the ACMA must relate to the SBS Codes of Practice. If ACMA is satisfied that the complaint is justified, it may recommend that the SBS take action to comply with the relevant code of practice or take such other action as it considers appropriate, including broadcasting an apology. The SBS has 30 days to take the action that ACMA recommends. If it does not do so, ACMA may give the Minister a written report on the matter which must be presented to Parliament within seven sitting days.See answer to (a).</DOC>

The SBS operates as an independent public service broadcaster with significant commercial interests and activities and with a Board with governance arrangements that are broadly consistent with the Board Template as outlined in the Uhrig Review.The broad strategic direction for the SBS is set by its Charter which is contained in s6 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 (SBS Act).The Board has been delegated responsibility for performance. Under Section 9 of the SBS Act the Board is required to ensure SBS performs its functions 'in a proper, efficient and economical manner and with the maximum benefit to the people of Australia'.The Government does not believe it is appropriate to amend the SBS Act as suggested by the Member for Lowe. As is standard for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities such as the SBS, the SBS is subject to a range of accountability and governance measures to monitor its performance and compliance with the terms of its legislation and Charter. These measures include the preparation of Corporate Plans, Annual Reports, Budget Statements, and appearances before Parliamentary Committees such as Legislative Estimates Committees.</DOC>

Australia Post has advised that while these dates may not be the actual dates the changes came into effect, they are indicative of when the changes occurred. (c) The PCODE database does not normally include the reason for a change of postcode. Australia Post has advised that changes generally occur for the following reasons:as a result of the Rural Roadside Numbering project (this is a state government initiative undertaken by local councils to ensure all properties are numbered in accordance with national standards);as a result of the realignment of locality boundaries by state and territory government land administration agencies;to accommodate areas with large population growth;to provide specific postcodes for post office box suites; andchanged mail circulation arrangements.Attachment APOSTCODE CHANGES 1 JANUARY 2000 to 31 MAY 2007State/PostcodeLocality/SuburbDate

The AFP conducted enquiries into the allegations against Sheikh Al Hilali to determine if a criminal investigation was warranted. At the conclusion of these enquiries the AFP did not identify any evidence to support an investigation of Sheikh Al Hilali or others for terrorist financing offences.The specific avenues of enquiries undertaken by AFP in making this assessment are of an operational nature and it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment, except to indicate the AFP undertook enquiries in both Australia and Lebanon.Yes.The AFP formally advised Sheikh Al Hilali in writing of the outcome of it's assessment on 8 May 2007.AFP enquiries in this matter took four weeks, at the conclusion of which, it was determined an investigation was not warranted.The specific avenues of enquiries undertaken by the AFP in making this assessment are of an operational nature and it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment.I make no comment on the details of public statements made by Sheikh Al Hilali.I make no comment on the details of public statements made by Sheikh Al Hilali.</DOC>

The AFP cannot confirm this event.The specific details provided by Sheik Al Hilali to the AFP in relation to this matter are of an operational nature and it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment.I am aware that Mr Bilal Shaabaan and Sheik Nasrallah are linked by their mutual participation in the Lebanese political system.I am not able to comment on the content of broadcasts from the Tahweed radio network in Lebanon.The Australian Government has a process for listing terrorist organisations under the   Criminal Code Act 1995. Separately, Australia fulfils its international obligations to comply with the UN Security Council Resolutions to freeze terrorist assets through a Consolidated List made under the Charter of the United Nationals (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2002.Hizballah's External Security Organisation (ESO) has been listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995 since June 2003. Hizballah's ESO was most recently re-listed as a terrorist organisation by the Criminal Code Amendment Regulations (No. 9) 2007 with effect from 25 May 2007.On 21 December 2001 Hizballah was specified as a terrorist organisation for the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2002.</DOC>

Yes.Items are included in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) - an independent, expert advisory body whose members include medical practitioners, health scientists, other health professionals and a consumer representative.The PBAC has not yet received a submission which demonstrates that FLOMAXTRA is clinically effective, safe and cost-effective (compared with other treatments) in the treatment for conditions associated with an enlarged prostate. Therefore, the Committee is not in a position to recommend that it be made available through the PBS.In assessing an application to list a drug on the PBS, the PBAC is required to take into account the medical condition/s for which the product has been approved for use in Australia as well as its clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness (value for money) and clinical role compared with other treatments.Although there are no drugs listed on the PBS with the same indications as FLOMAXTRA, there are other drugs listed for the treatment of urinary complaints. Doctors are in the best position to advise patients of the suitability of these products, or other non-pharmaceutical interventions, for the treatment of this condition.Neither the Government nor the PBAC is able to compel a manufacturer to apply for the PBS listing of a particular product to treat a particular condition. Decisions on these matters involve commercial and other considerations that can only be made by the manufacturer involved. Were FLOMAXTRA, or any other drug, to be recommended by the PBAC for listing on the PBS for use in conditions associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, then listing would proceed in accordance with the usual post-PBAC processes.</DOC>

The Commonwealth Government makes available a very wide range of necessary prescription medicines for the Australian community through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The PBS has provided Australians with cost-effective, necessary medicinal products for more than 50 years.It has been the policy of all governments since 1990 that patients be required to pay a co-payment prescription charge toward the cost of all subsidised PBS drugs. Many of the drugs included on the PBS cost a great deal more than the amount paid by consumers, with the government subsidising the cost above the level of the patient co-payment. General patients pay up to $30.70 for each prescription, and concessional patients pay up to $4.90.In addition, safety net arrangements further assist in limiting the cost of medicines for those patients and families who require a large number of PBS prescriptions.In 2007, the safety net threshold for concession cardholders is $274.40, while the general patient threshold is $1059.00. After reaching the safety net threshold, general patients pay $4.90 for further PBS prescriptions, and concessional patients pay nothing for any further PBS prescriptions for the remainder of that calendar year.A medical expenses tax offset is also available for people who have out-of-pocket medical expenses over a specified limit in an income year. Net medical expenses are the total medical expenses that have been paid less any refunds that have been received, or could be received, from Medicare or a private health fund. For the 2006-07 income years, the tax offset is 20 percent of the net medical expenses over the $1,500 threshold amount. There is no upper limit to the amount a person can claim except that it can only reduce the total tax liability to zero. Further information on the medical expenses tax offset may be accessed from the Australian Taxation Office.The Commonwealth Government is committed to providing affordable access to PBS medicines for all Australians. The policy of patient co-payments for PBS medicines is part of an overall strategy to contain costs and secure the sustainability of the Scheme. This will ensure the availability of the latest medicines for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis and other serious and chronic conditions.</DOC>

The Government responded to issues raised during the inquiry in its 2006 media reform package introducing a range of measures to drive digital uptake. These measures include:Developing a Digital Action Plan to drive the take-up of digital television services and help consumers make the transition from analogue services to the new digital environment;Opening up two reserved digital channels for new digital services such as mobile television or new in home services;Permitting commercial free-to-air television stations to broadcast one standard definition multichannel from 2009, and allow full multichannelling no later than the time of digital switchover;Permitting a high definition multichannel from 2007 by removing the simulcast requirement on high definition television programming; andRemoving the 'genre' restrictions on the types of programming which can be shown on ABC and SBS multichannels.On 13 July 2006 the Government announced, in the context of its media reform package, that:'The Government will not allocate new commercial television licences within broadcasting services band (BSB) spectrum between the end of the moratorium on new licences on 31 December 2006 and digital switchover. The allocation of new licences will be reviewed in accordance with the Digital Action Plan prior to the end of the simulcast period.'</DOC>

Australian travel and financial sanctions are targeted at those who have been directly responsible for the Mugabe regime's human rights abuses and for its gross economic mismanagement. It would be inappropriate to comment on the existence of any investigations into potential sanctions breaches.I am aware that a number of allegations have been made against a visa holder in relation to membership in Zimbabwe's National Youth Service. I am unable to confirm these allegations.This question should be directed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.I am aware of lists being circulated in Australia alleging that children of Zimbabwe regime members are in Australia. It would be inappropriate to comment further.Australian financial sanctions prohibit transactions involving the transfer of funds or payments to, by the order of, or on behalf of listed persons.

No. In August 2001 I, (Mr Downer) in conjunction with then World Bank President Wolfensohn, announced a joint Australia-World Bank program to support the Virtual Colombo Plan (VCP). The Australian Government committed $200 million over five years.The VCP was a five year joint aid initiative between the Australian Government and the World Bank promoting Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for development. The VCP aimed to address the 'digital divide' between rich and developing nations, and in doing so promote opportunities for people in developing countries to access education, information and knowledge.        To ensure that ICTs were utilised as tools to achieve clear development outcomes in line with program strategies, most VCP-related activities were undertaken as part of country and regionally funded programs. There were almost 200 development activities funded from 2001 to 2006 that contained ICT related expenditure.        There were 601 Australian Development Scholarships granted in ICT-related fields to build the skill base and ICT capacity amongst Australia's regional partners. 201 Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development volunteered in ICT roles to build local knowledge and assist in skill transfers within the region.Total Australian government expenditure for the VCP was $230 million.All expenditure has been accounted for. The VCP has made significant achievements in addressing the digital divide, including strengthening education, training decision makers, providing information infrastructure and knowledge tools and ensuring that ICTs were effectively utilised within Australia's aid program.No.</DOC>

Refer to answer to Question on Notice 3836 Part (4). There is nothing further to add. (b) Customs retains a record of CCTV footage used for operational purposes. It does not routinely record which cameras are recorded and which are not. There were no recordings made at the time and no footage was captured and no CCTV footage was retained for operational purposes.Although all cameras are capable of being recorded, should that be required to cover Customs operational requirements, not all cameras continuously record. CCTV data recorded by Customs is held for a limited time and is then routinely destroyed in line with normal operating procedures. Providing details about CCTV footage recorded on the public record could potentially harm Customs' operational effectiveness.Providing details on the public record about which CCTV cameras have been recording and when could potentially harm Customs' operational effectiveness.</DOC>

Federal electorate level data on the GP to population ration is not used for the determination of district of workforce shortage status and as such is not part of the range of data used by the Department on a routine basis.The GP to population ratio is determined at the Statistical Local Area (SLA) level and updated every quarter. The GP (full time equivalent - FTE) to population ratio for Australia in 2005-06 was 1,393. (b) The GP (FTE) to population ratio for New South Wales in 2005/06 was 1355. (c) Federal electorate level data on the GP to population ratio is not used for the determination of district of workforce shortage status and as such is not part of the range of data used by the Department on a routine basis.The electoral division of Throsby comprises two Statistical Local Areas (SLAs)  -  Wollongong (C) and Shellharbour (C). The Wollongong (C) SLA is also shared with the electoral division of Cunningham. The SLA of Shellharbour (C) is currently classified as a district of workforce shortage.The Commonwealth Government has a number of strategies in place to ensure that in the future, the constituents of Throsby will have access to adequate medical services. These include greatly increased numbers of medical school places at universities and the introduction of bonded medical school places schemes whereby graduating doctors commit to work in districts of workforce shortage, for up to six years. Current workforce programs include:
MedicarePlus for Other Medical Practitioners (MOMPs) Program
The MOMPs Program provides access to the A1 Medicare rebate for services provided in Areas of Workforce Shortage (AOWS) by eligible pre-1996 non-vocationally registered medical practitioners.As the Statistical Local Area (SLA) of Shellharbour (C) is considered to be an AOWS, eligible medical practitioners in this area, including in Albion Park, Shellharbour and Tongarra are able to access this program.
The After Hours OMPs (AHOMPs) Program
The AHOMPs Program provides access to the A1 Medicare rebate for after hours general practice services, provided through an accredited general practice or an accredited Medical Deputising Service (MDS) by eligible non-vocationally recognised medical practitioners.As eligibility for the AHOMPs Program is not determined by geographical location, eligible medical practitioners providing after hours services through an accredited MDS or accredited general practice in the SLA of Shellharbour (C) are eligible for this Program.
Medicare provider number restrictions
The Commonwealth Government has been effective in attracting and retaining more doctors in rural and remote and metropolitan areas through the Medicare provider number restrictions, which relate to overseas trained doctors. Under these restrictions, overseas trained doctors (OTDs) are required to work in designated 'areas of workforce shortage' for up to 10 years. Practices in the electorate of Throsby are eligible for the engagement of OTDs.</DOC>

Federal electorate level data on the GP to population ratio is not used for the determination of district of workforce shortage status and as such is not part of the range of data used by the Department on a routine basis. The relevant GP to population ratio data level for the determination of district of workforce shortage is usually at the statistical local area (SLA) level, or on occasions, aggregates of SLAs. SLAs are not a subordinate unit of electorates and therefore any extrapolation will be imprecise. Likewise, the GP to population ratio for individual postcodes cannot be extrapolated as an SLA can encompass more than one postcode.The Department does not routinely release nor utilise the GP to population ratio at the State/Territory level. However, the national GP to population ratio is currently in the vicinity of 1:1,350.</DOC>

Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans' Affairs patients and some compensation cases.Electorate level data should be considered as estimates only. Allocations of services are based on the reported postal address postcodes of patients. Therefore some data will not accurately reflect the address of where the patient actually resides.Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from Population Census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.Postcode data recorded using a post office box or private mailbag are excluded from electorate reporting in the cases where they cannot be accurately allocated.The statistics for New South Wales and Australia above have been aggregated from postcode data, not from electorates.It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.</DOC>

2004-052005-062006-07 (to 31 March 2007)$316,777$344,919$256,076(b) WaterThe Department leases all its premises and the building owners pay for water usage. The Department has therefore not spent anything on water usage.(2) Measures to Reduce Electricity and Water Usage

Electricity
- Building Management Systems to monitor and control lighting, power, mechanical services and lifts.- Solar hot water.- T5 light fittings with electronic ballasts and tri-phosphor tubes to reduce power consumption and allow the lights to dim.- Perimeter lighting that dims in strong sunlight.- Ultra-sonic motion detectors to control lighting in meeting rooms.- Provision of highly energy efficient frictionless chillers for supply of cool air.- Above ground car-parking is naturally ventilated - significantly reducing the need for mechanical extraction.- Rationalisation of equipment (large centralised energy efficient photocopiers, printers, refrigerators).- Thermal conductivity of the façade minimised, including thermal insulation in the spandrel panels.- Double glazed windows with reflective surfaces and low-E film to reduce glare and heat gain/loss.- Suspended slabs and perimeter walls are insulated.- Swirl diffusers and low screens increase air-circulation efficiency.- Smaller airconditioning zones allow finer and more efficient control of air temperature and supply.- Close to public transport, facilities provided for cyclists and walkers.- Heat extracted from the Server Room provides heating in the lobby all hours.- Power factor correction equipment improves efficient use of power and avoids possible penalties imposed by the supply authority for poor power factor.
Water
- Rainwater collection tank and use of rainwater for WCs and irrigation.- Water-free urinals.- Sensor taps on hand basins eliminate water wastage (and are more hygienic).- AAA rated fittings (such as dual flush toilets and water efficient shower heads) have lower water usage.- Landscaping designed to increase infiltration of rainwater and reduce runoff.</DOC>

Water consumption figures are not available for most Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaCSIA) office buildings as the majority of premises are leased. In leased premises, water used is paid for by the building owner and charged to FaCSIA as part of the building outgoings. Consumption details are not collected from landlords by FaCSIA.FaCSIA does not keep a consolidated list of water usage figures for its staff housing portfolio. I consider that the preparation of answers to this question would involve a significant diversion of resources and in the circumstances I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.The measures instigated by the department to reduce water usage since 2001 are outlined in the Department's Sustainability Reports for 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05. These reports can be accessed at:http://www.facsia.gov.au/triplebottomline/2005/glance/index.html.Water reduction measures include the installation of waterless urinals in one large FaCSIA site, installation of dual flush toilet systems in new fitouts where possible, turning off water features, reducing the watering of landscaping and the implementation of staff awareness initiatives aimed at reducing water consumption.</DOC>

The Department of Education, Science and TrainingWater consumption figures are not available for DEST. This is because most premises occupied by DEST are leased and the cost of water used is paid for by the building owner in the first instance and then re-charged, either in part or in full, as part of the building outgoings. In addition, most buildings only have a single water meter which records usage by all tenants as well as the base building systems such as air-conditioning. Many of the buildings we occupy are shared with other tenants and we are not able to determine what proportion of overall usage is attributable to DEST.QuestaconWater usage records prior to 2003/04 are unable to be accessed as they relate to the period when Questacon was located within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Portfolio. Current water metering arrangements indicate water usage for both Questacon and the National Capital Authority (NCA) jointly and are therefore not reflective of Questacon usage.The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS)Financial YearTotal water usage (litres)2000/01Not available2001/022,187,600 *2002/032,187,6002003/042,699,9002004/051,951,4002005/062,509,7002006/07 (as at 22/6/07)2,967,500* readings start from 16/3/01 2,037,100L and show a consumption of 2,129,500L up to 30/6/01 for the 3.5 months.

The cost to each department and agency for ICT products and services for the period that the question covers is not readily available. Providing the relevant information would involve retrieving details of thousands of financial transactions, which would constitute an unreasonable diversion of resources.

Where a foster carer has a child support liability for another child they do not have the foster child recognised as a relevant dependant child in their assessment. Foster children are State Wards covered under state/territory care and protection systems. Formal foster carers, including grandparents and relative carers, are usually paid an allowance and supplementary payments by the relevant authority. These payments are not subject to income tax or income testing provisions.The Australian Government makes a substantial contribution to the wellbeing of all Australian families, including foster, relative and kinship families. Assistance includes the provision of Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Benefit, and providing all children in foster care with access to the Foster Child Health Care Card and access to the Transition to Independent Living Allowance.In addition, a foster carer who pays child support for another child has this amount deducted from the family income used to calculate their Family Assistance payments.All eligible carers are able to access applicable benefits and payments regardless of whether their care is on a formal or informal basis, providing they have ongoing, full-time, day-to-day care and responsibility for the child or young person.</DOC>

I am aware of the article.I understand that the article states that a 'small proportion of about 900 back-office mortgage jobs would be sent to Bangalore in India'.There is no specific requirement for Australian financial institutions to disclose to customers that their personal information may be accessed by persons overseas. Such a requirement has not been considered necessary given the broader regulation in this area.Protections currently exist under the Privacy Act 1998, which is designed to ensure that an organisation in Australia does not avoid its privacy obligations simply by moving personal information offshore. National Privacy Principle 9  -  transborder data flows  -  only permits the transfer of personal information to someone who is in a foreign country in limited circumstances.The transfer can only occur where the organisation reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a law, binding scheme or contract that effectively imposes principles substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles. There are other circumstances in which the transfer may be permitted, including where the individual consents to the transfer, or in the event that the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual and the organisation.Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has prudential standards that contain requirements relating to security and confidentially of information in any offshoring agreement, and has released a prudential practice guide on offshore outsourcing for banks (PPG 231  -  Outsourcing), building societies and credit unions which is consistent with the National Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988.The guide states that the security and confidentially of information in any offshoring agreement should typically include contractual provisions in relation to data that would be of the same standard as those of a domestic service provider and comply with requirements under Australian legislation and regulations, and that an agreement ensures that all information forwarded to the offshore service provider remain the property of the regulated institution.Further to this, banks have a general duty of confidentiality which is confirmed in the Australian Bankers' Association's (ABA) Code of Banking Practice.</DOC>

These include an arms embargo and a ban on the provision of military technical assistance, advice and training, as well as travel bans and financial sanctions on individuals designated by the UN Security Council as having impeded the peace process, constituting a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, or having committed violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities (Resolution 1591 of March 2005).The Government has implemented sanctions in relation to Sudan and Darfur in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions.The UN Security Council has imposed and Australia has implemented sanctions against individuals designated by the Security Council as having impeded the peace process, constituting a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, or having committed violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities. The Government would support further sanctions deemed necessary by the UN Security Council.</DOC>

I am aware of the IAEA's 23 May 2007 report and its conclusion that at Iran's Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz 'on 13 May 2007, eight 164-machine cascades [of centrifuges] were operating simultaneously and were being fed with UF6 [uranium hexafluoride]; two other similar cascades had been vacuum tested and three more were under construction.'The technical ability to produce sufficient highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon is dependent on a variety of factors including the ability to operate large cascades of centrifuges continuously, the reliability of the centrifuge cascades when operational, the availability of requisite spare parts and centrifuge components, and the quality of the UF6 used.I note unconfirmed media reports that IAEA Director-General ElBaradei has advised unnamed diplomats that Iran will have installed 8,000 centrifuges by December 2007. On the question of whether this would be enough to provide sufficient weapons-grade uranium for several bombs each year, see the answer to (1) above.Yes.Australia has raised its concerns that Iran has failed to suspend its enrichment-related activities as required by United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions in bilateral discussions with all five permanent members of the UNSC. In its statement delivered to the First Committee of the UN General Assembly in October 2006, Australia supported the UNSC engagement on Iran's nuclear program. Australia has also raised its concerns about Iran's enrichment activities at the quarterly meetings of the IAEA Board of Governors, of which Australia is a member.</DOC>

I am aware of community support for the Ceren family to remain in Australia. The family's application for a protection visa was refused by the departmental decision maker and that decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal because they were found not to be owed Australia's protection. The family have requested that I consider exercising my public interest power under section 417 of the Migration Act 1958. I have asked that the family undergo health and character checks before I will consider intervening in their case.My Department has provided the family with the necessary documentation to enable them to undertake the necessary health and character checks. The family have not yet finalised those checks.On 17 April 2007, the Department's Hobart office provided Mr Rodriguez Quijada with an application form to enable him to apply for permission to work. As at 22 June 2007, an application had not been received by the Department.</DOC>

This question should be asked of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.The bilateral social security agreement with Greece was signed on 23 May 2007. The agreement will take effect following the completion of all necessary treaty and legislative processes in both countries and once all necessary administrative arrangements have been finalised. At this stage this is expected to occur some time in 2008. The placement of staff in Greece to assist customers with claims and enquiries is one of a range of options that Centrelink will consider.This question should be asked of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.</DOC>

I attended a luncheon in May 2006 with a number of major beef processors including Australian Meat Holdings. The informal discussion centred around inadequacies in rail lines operated by Queensland and NSW State Labor Governments.The Terms of Reference for the Ipswich Motorway Alternative Northern Corridor Study required 'Consultation to be undertaken with key stakeholders including elected representatives, Government Agencies, service providers and land owners to identify issues and management options for input into the selection of the preferred feasible alignment'. The independent consulting firm appointed to conduct the study, Maunsell Australia Pty Ltd, undertook this consultation. I am advised that, as Australian Meat Holdings were considered to be a major stakeholder, a meeting between Maunsell and Australian Meat Holdings took place. I am further advised that at this meeting, Australian Meat Holdings discussed issues relating to the design of the road in relation to their property and the management of any construction impacts on their operations.</DOC>

The consultation process is continuing and no date for its conclusion has been set.As part of the consultation process with State and Territory Governments, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Dutton MP, wrote to State and Territory Treasurers in January this year, seeking their agreement to the necessary changes in the GST legislation. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer is yet to receive a response from all States and Territories to these letters. Once all responses have been received the Government will be in a position to consider its response.It would be inappropriate for me to comment on these matters while the consultation process is continuing.</DOC>

Anecdotal advice from firms is that the application process assists them to identify the cash flow required for the research, and to confirm the role that research has in supporting the company's business strategy. Anecdotal advice from other providers of financial resources, such as venture capitalists, is that undertaking the application process improves the due diligence of companies and hence their capacity to source other funds.Information about how successful Commercial Ready grant recipients have been in attracting subsequent private funding has not been collected.One of the merit criteria for Commercial Ready is the need for funding. In addressing that criterion, the applicant needs to address the reasons why the project would not proceed satisfactorily without a grant. If the applicant's financial position shows that the applicant has sufficient resources (including investment funds) to fund the whole project without grant support, the applicant is not funded.My Department's response to the Productivity Commission's concern about Commercial Ready was:'Commercial Ready provides benefits to the economy by supporting projects of Australian SMEs which have the potential to successfully bring their product to the market but which also must demonstrate the need for funding to satisfactorily progress their project. As such it aims to support additional activity.Commercial Ready assessment screens out projects that would proceed in the absence of public support. It only provides matching grants where this can successfully market products of national benefit.'To address feedback from industry, the application process for small grants of $50,000 to $250,000 under Commercial Ready Plus will be faster and simpler than under Commercial Ready. Applicants under Commercial Ready Plus, including small and medium sized enterprises and spinoffs from universities and public sector research organisations, will benefit from a more streamlined application and assessment process.The intention of the Commercial Ready Plus program (an element of the Commercial Ready program) is to provide both public sector research organisation spin-offs and private companies with streamlined access to smaller grants of $50,000 to $250,000 by providing companies with faster and simpler access. The application, assessment and contract management processes for Commercial Ready are regularly re-examined for potential improvements and streamlining, and appropriate changes will continue to be made to the program.Government recognises that innovation projects can be unpredictable in terms of the actual timing of activities as they are highly dependent on the outcome of research at different stages. Extensions of time to complete activities are often required by companies and this results in funding commitments being moved into later financial years. In light of these delays, an estimated $25 million of Commercial Ready funding was identified as not expected to be required in 2007/08.Commercial Ready grantees have the opportunity for ongoing contact with their AusIndustry Customer Service Manager and are required to report on project expenditure and activities each quarter.To date, 4% of projects have been identified as solely for proof of concept and a further 57% have been identified as involving proof of concept activities as well as other activities.</DOC>

and (b) The Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), a company owned by the Australian Government responsible for the management of the interstate rail track network, has been monitoring 'wheel squeal' noise at Heathfield since 2005. This is on the same track as Forestville.Noise regulation and the setting of 'acceptable' noise levels are the responsibility of the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority.Train movements on the Melbourne-Adelaide corridor have increased from 3,676 in 2004 to 4,319 in 2006. However, this is as a result of natural growth in the transport task and should not be attributed to the opening of the Adelaide-Darwin railway.Residential development along the rail corridor was approved through the South Australian planning system when issues such as rail noise from the existing rail line were considered. The ARTC and all train operators are individually licensed by the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority and are required to have an Environmental Improvement Program to address 'wheel squeal'. Planning issues, including the need for any noise abatement programs, would be a matter for the South Australian Government.</DOC>

YesEligibility for an aged pension is a matter for the Minister for Human Services.In relation to passport applications, the term 'senior' is used by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to refer to Australians who are 75 years or over. The term is not associated with the varying definitions used by other organisations in Australia.The decision to offer a five-year passport to Australians aged 75 years and over was in response to considerable feedback from people in that particular age group. The decision recognises the needs of a group of Australians who wish to undertake limited travel overseas at this time of their life.</DOC>

The attached table contains the details that successful applicants have agreed to make public.  Permission has not been received from the applicants to publicise the number of indirect jobs expected to be created by their projects but the press release of the 22 December 2006 provided a total indirect job number for all projects of 150.36 applications were received for consideration under the PKIFF. The total amount of funding sought was $25,934,205.We did not seek, and therefore do not have, permission to make available information on the unsuccessful applicants.  This information is considered commercial in confidence and could not be released without the approval of the applicants.All applicants were required to address, in their applications for funding under the PKIFF, five merit criteria.  These criteria were published in the PKIFF Customer Information Guide. One of the criteria asked for justification of the number of sustainable new jobs created and the sustainability of the project over the longer term without the need for ongoing Government support.  Assessment of the relative merit of applications was made against these claims and was reviewed by the assessment panel that included local business representatives.

Yes.Yes, there was formerly a Medicare office in Deer Park which closed in February 1998. At that time, the Deer Park Medicare Office had low customer traffic.Medicare Austalia Access Points are located at the Amcal Pharmacy in the Brimbank Central Shopping Centre, Deer Park and Pepin's Pharmacy in Caroline Springs.Medicare Australia considers a number of criteria when establishing a Medicare office, including:the availability of other claims lodgement methods such as: Medicare Australia Access Points, Medicare Easyclaim and Medicare Australia's Online Claiming;the volume of claims lodged by customers in the area and the nature and level of different types of billing by doctors in the area;the proximity to other Medicare offices and the potential impact it might have on the workload of other Medicare offices;the current bulk billing level in the area;the cost of establishing and maintaining new Medicare offices; anda suitable site for the Medicare office - considerations include transport and security of staff and customers.The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have ready access to Medicare. To emphasise this commitment, the Government has announced a new initiative, Medicare Easyclaim, which will allow patients to lodge their Medicare claims and receive their rebates through an EFTPOS machine in participating doctors' surgeries. This initiative builds on existing e-claiming and other claiming channels and will be delivered in the second half of 2007. The take up of Medicare Easyclaim will deliver enhanced convenience for the public as well as providing benefits for doctors and practice managers.</DOC>

There is no proposal to construct a dam, only a report identifying a range of options. There is a clear need to augment the current water supplies of both south east Queensland and north east NSW. All options should be on the table in order to find the most cost effective means to supply this water. The existence of a state border should not be sufficient reason to rule out any option.No. I have seen no rigorous scientific environmental or socio-economic studies to support this contention. The recent report Integrated Water Supply Options for North East NSW and South East Queensland identifies that the demand for water in the Tweed Shire is likely to rise from around 10,200 megalitres per year in 2005 to around 28,000 megalitres per year in 2050. The growing communities of the Tweed Region are likely to be confronted by severe social, economic and environmental impacts if reliable water supplies are not secured. As noted in the report, all options to construct dams to supply water for north east NSW and south east Queensland will require further detailed environmental, economic and social assessment.</DOC>

The Department's decision not to fund the project is based on two factors. First, the proposal sought funding under the 'Addressing Indigenous Needs  -  National Illicit Drug Strategy  -  Capacity Building in Indigenous Communities Initiative'. Under the funding guidelines and principles for this program, funding is available over four years, from 2005-06 to 2008-09 to support projects on a trial and/or one off basis that could be implemented or adapted in other communities. The Redfern-Waterloo Project seeks capital funding and recurrent funding to establish and then maintain an ongoing service (funding sought for 12 staff over four years), which extends beyond the life of the Initiative. The focus of the program and the inability to provide recurrent funding for core activities was discussed with the organisation by phone on 5 March 2007.Second, the project primarily has an accommodation or housing rather then a treatment and intervention focus and may be more appropriately funded by another agency.The Department has also written to Mr Robert Domm, Chief Executive Officer of the Redfern-Waterloo Authority proposing a joint meeting with the NSW Indigenous Coordination Centre, the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FACSIA), Aboriginal Hostels Limited and the Redfern-Waterloo Authority, to assess the proposal further.The Department currently funds the following services in the Redfern area relating to alcohol and other substance misuse:The Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) Substance Use Program provided recurrent funding to the Aboriginal Medical Service Cooperative Ltd - Redfern, for their substance use program.
 Funding for 2006-07 is $72,667 (GST exclusive).
 The service has a non-residential drug and alcohol unit providing the following substance use programs: family based programs, prevention and early intervention programs, harm minimisation programs, case management, relapse prevention programs and counselling.The service also provides outpatient detoxification and pharmaecotherapy maintenance services, counselling and welfare support, self-help relapse prevention and support groups, community education and outreach programs in high risk communities.

I was present at the Australian Meat Holdings site on 5 March 2007 when the Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard MP and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, jointly announced the Government's decision to construct the Goodna Bypass. I did not have discussions with Australian Meat Holdings on that occasion and have not had discussions or other communications with Australian Meat Holdings since that time.The Terms of Reference for the Ipswich Motorway Alternative Northern Corridor Study required 'Consultation to be undertaken with key stakeholders including elected representatives, Government Agencies, service providers and land owners to identify issues and management options for input into the selection of the preferred feasible alignment'. The independent consulting firm appointed to conduct the Study, Maunsell Australia Pty Ltd, undertook this consultation. I am advised that, as Australian Meat Holdings were considered to be a major stakeholder according to the Study's Terms of Reference, that a meeting between Maunsell and AMH took place. I am further advised that Australian Meat Holdings did not make any other representations or submissions to the consultant or to my Department on the matter of the Goodna Bypass.</DOC>

The Department abides by the secrecy provisions within section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (HIA) and section 135A of the National Health Act 1953 (NHA), which govern the use and disclosure of Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) information. Secrecy provisions restrict disclosure of statistics for small areas that might enable the identification of an individual patient, practitioner or organisation  (HIA 130 (5) and NHA 135A (5)).As a result of privacy and confidentiality concerns, the Minister directed in 2004 that the Commonwealth Electorate was the smallest area for which general statistics could be released.For these reasons, the Department is unable to release information on the number of patients who received a service at the Darug Medical Service for each of the past five years.The Department does not have information about the number of patients turned away from medical practices.</DOC>

The Department (excluding the Child Support Agency and CRS Australia)
 2004-20051, $ 2,937.72, 2005-20062 $21,387.80, 2006-20073 $15,129.90.1 Department created in October 2004 with a total of 54 staff at 30 June 2005.2 Total staff at 30 June 2006 was 94. Electricity costs were direct and not covered under a gross lease arrangement.3 Costs for approximately 140 staff located in Computer Associates House to end March 2007. Other electricity costs are covered in a gross lease arrangement with Medicare Australia for the Canberra Avenue building.
 The Department does not meet water costs directly as the building owner meets these costs.In the course of lease negotiations, the Department has always sought environmentally supportable solutions in relation to water and electricity usage. These include:- dual flush toilets;- the reporting of all leaking taps;- regular staff notices about reducing light and water usage;- energy efficient lighting;- after hours air conditioning requirements; and- current whole-of-government contract for electricity is for 8% GreenPower (renewable energy).Child Support Agency
 2004-05 $391,086.84, 2005-06 $437,669.93,  2006-071 $230,186.95.
 CSA is unable to monitor the cost of water as these costs are included in total leasing costs for tenancies.Since 1 July 2000, CSA has undertaken the following initiatives to reduce electricity consumption:- recognised electricity consumption as a major environmental aspect in CSA' s Environmental Management System;- undertaken energy audits in CSA's sites to identify where efficiencies can be made;- monitored energy usage in sites to provide benchmarking information;- incorporated EEGO policy initiatives into leasing and fitout construction activities;- incorporated Green Lease Schedules into new leases as appropriate; and- included energy efficiency features as part of revised guidelines for new fitouts.CRS AustraliaFor each financial year since 1 July 2004, CRS Australia has spent the following:
 2004-05 $704,238.46, 2005-06 $726,803.43, 2006-07 $821,258.77.
 It is not possible to accurately quantify expenditure on water usage, due to the broad variation in charging methodologies in shared tenancies and differing commercial leasing arrangements, that may or may not be inclusive of outgoings.Since 1 July 2000, CRS Australia has instigated the following measures to reduce electricity and water usage as new offices are fitted out or existing offices refurbished:- installation of energy efficient T5 fluorescent globes in new office fitouts;- replacement of the small number of incandescent globes with fluorescent globes;- window blinds and solar film on western windows to reduce radiant heat transfer; and- automatic timers on lights and hot water units.The following initiatives have also been implemented:- identification of highest use offices for detailed energy audits; and- staff awareness campaign through management communication, intranet resources and environmental champions.No specific water consumption reduction measures have been taken. Water usage is limited to personal hygiene and limited dishwashing. Managers are responsible for compliance with local water restrictions.All figures are GST exclusive. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

The Australian passport application fee has been increased by Consumer Price Index (CPI) levels annually since 1992. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed that passport fees be increased each July in line with the movement in the March CPI for the preceding 12 months.The annual Consumer Price Index adjustment allows passport fees to retain relativity with the increase in material and services required to produce the documents.Fees for other travel documents are calculated as a fixed percentage of the increased fee for an ordinary adult passport.Estimates of demand (2006-07 actual): 2006-072007-082008-092009-102010-11Adult passports945,424972,4771,042,544979,991979,991Child/Senior366,805265,486284,614267,537267,537Freq Adult24,5078,3528,9548,4168,416Freq Child/Senior1,0185,6946,1055,7385,738Certificate of Identity582633678638638Document of Identity2,3511,8982,0351,9131,913UN Travel Document1,7604,1764,4774,2084,208Emergency6,8346,2016,6476,2486,248Total1,349,2811,265,4221,356,5961,275,2001,275,200Estimates of revenue (inclusive of GST, 2006-07 actual):Revenue(A$ Million)2006-072007-082008-092009-102010-11Adult passports179.62194.50212.68204.82209.72Child/Senior34.8426.5529.0328.0928.63Freq Adult6.982.512.742.642.70Freq Child/Senior0.150.850.930.900.92Certificate of Identity0.070.080.080.080.08Document of Identity0.090.080.080.080.08UN Travel Document0.200.500.550.530.54Emergency0.490.470.510.490.50Priority services11.9911.2912.4311.9912.29Lost and Stolen1.121.701.851.791.84Total235.55238.52260.89251.41257.31The tables provided at (b) above incorporate estimated demand and fee increases for each of the passport categories.

Goods are imported when they arrive at an Australian airport or seaport from overseas on board an aircraft or ship, with the intention of being unloaded in Australia. Any goods that arrive by the post; courier; freight forwarder; shipping company; airline, or other means are considered as imported and must be reported to Customs as cargo. These goods are subject to Customs control until they are released into 'home consumption' or otherwise treated. Home consumption is where the goods are intended to be used or available for sale once they have been imported.Import Declarations are used to clear goods above a certain threshold directly into home consumption or into home consumption from a warehouse. As of 8 October 2005 the threshold was increased for air and sea cargo from $250 to $1,000. Where imported goods have a value below the threshold the importer must complete a Self Assessed Clearance (SAC) Declaration or other prescribed forms to have the goods released from Customs control. The exception is where the goods arrive in Australia by post; no SAC or other prescribed forms are required where the value of the goods is under $1,000.

The Minister is aware of the findings of the ABARE report, Economic Impact of Climate Change Policy, which models a decrease in emissions of 50% of 1990 levels by 2050; and of a number of other reports which model the cost of reducing emissions within other timeframes.The Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability report released, by Senator Campbell in 2005, identifies key risks for Australian society and industry and underpins the Australian Government's recently announced $170 million initiative on adaptation to climate change impacts.Yes.and (5) Projections provided in the Tracking to the Kyoto Target 2006 report indicate that Government measures are expected to reduce Australia's annual greenhouse gas emissions by 87 million tonnes by 2010.Australia has relatively high rates of economic growth and there is strong international demand for Australia's resources. The Government's objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining our economic prosperity.to (8) The 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by its Working Group 2 (Chapter 11) reviews the projected impacts of climate change on a range of Australian species and ecosystems. The new $126 million Australian Government Centre for Climate Change Adaptation will focus on biodiversity as a priority area.</DOC>

Defence's response relates to fuel usage for all commercial vehicles used by the department. Fuel usage for operating military assets has been excluded.Cars run by Defence predominantly use Unleaded Petrol (ULP). Figures for ULP expenditure have been extracted from Defence's ROMAN financial system. Unavoidably, these figures will include expenditure for fuel used in other equipment such as brush cutters and lawn mowers, however, expenditure for these purposes is not considered material.The total ULP expenditure for the Defence Department was:2004-05, $5.797 million.2005-06, $7.136 million.2006-07, $6.256 million.The department currently owns some 6,000 vehicles under its Commercial Vehicles Program. This includes cars (sedans and station wagons), light commercial utility vehicles, four wheel drive vehicles and small to medium passenger vehicles, buses, touring coaches and trailers. None of these vehicles run on LPG.As at the 30 April 2007 the department was leasing 163 vehicles under the Executive Vehicle Scheme. None of these vehicles run on LPG.There is currently no specific requirement for Defence to operate vehicles running on LPG.</DOC>

John Gorton Building has utilised 100% Greenpower since 2003. This ensures that the equivalent power used by the building is sourced from renewable energy sources. Renewable energy is energy derived from sources that cannot be depleted or can be replaced such as solar, wind, biomass (waste), wave or hydro. Clean, renewable sources don't produce greenhouse pollution.In addition to purchasing Green Power the department (in 2005-06) used approximately 30% less energy than the current Energy Efficiency in Government Operations target of 7,500 MJ/person/annum.Initiatives implemented to minimise the Department's adverse environmental impacts include:As part of the refurbishment of the John Gorton Building in 1998, the distribution, configuration and illumination provided by lighting systems was revised to minimise the number of fluorescent and other lights.The environmental awareness training which forms part of the Department's Environment Management System (EMS) encourages staff to use power saving options on computers and printers, switch off lights in conference rooms when not in use, and observe proper waste disposal and recycling practices. These awareness training presentations have been ongoing since 2003.Where possible, printers are set to duplex printing as default. This was implemented as part of a wholesale refresh of IT systems in 2005.The Department has been a participant in the Greenhouse Challenge Program (GHC) since 1997. GHC requires the Department to report annually against agreed carbon emission targets. A new GHC is being negotiated in 2007.The Department has reduced the amount of waste going to landfill by developing its recycling infrastructure. A 3-bin waste management system has been in use in the John Gorton Building since 1998, following a major building refurbishment, to encourage the recycling of plastics, paper and organics. Currently, around 75% of waste from the 3-bin system is recycled, a saving of around 128 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions.The Department also recycles chemical waste, including fluorescent lights, mobile phones and printer cartridges. Currently, 100% of fluorescent lights are recycled.The Department first introduced fuel efficient hybrid (Toyota Prius) vehicles into its pool vehicle fleet in 2003, and now has 5 hybrid vehicles. With the exception of special purpose vehicles, 100% of the fleet has a Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating of &gt;10.5, which confirms that CO2 emissions and other pollution as a result of pool vehicle use is minimised.Since 2003, the Department has subscribed to GreenFleet, whose tree planting program offsets 4.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide for each of the 36 vehicle pool and SES vehicle fleet, totalling 150 tonnes of CO2 per annum.Since 2004, the Department has also subscribed to BP Global Choice for its Senior Executive Service vehicle fleet, which operates a number of certified Green House Friendly emission reduction initiatives.A grey water system was installed as part of the building refurbishment in 1998. The amount of water generated by the system varies depending on the use of water in basins and showers but averages in the order of 2,800 litres of water each day, used for irrigation of garden beds and lawn areas around John Gorton Building.and (c) The number of lights in the Department's tenancy of the John Gorton Building is approx 2,500.The John Gorton Building is primarily fitted out with standard or compact fluorescent lights and a total of 12 halogen down lights (located in conference rooms). With the exception of emergency lighting, there are no incandescent light bulbs in use.As part of a building refurbishment in 1998, lower lighting levels were set in walkways and corridors, motion detectors introduced in conference rooms and in the centre wings of the building, and light diffusers applied to the panels of lights to enable an appropriate reduction of lighting levels on sunny days.The John Gorton Building does not have photovoltaic (solar) cells installed onsite nor does it actively source power from a solar-generated source. However, as indicated in part (a) of the answer, the John Gorton Building does source 100% of its electricity from accredited Green Power renewable energy sources which may include solar energy.The John Gorton Building has a solar hot water system that provides all the hot water for the Australian Greenhouse Office area, equivalent to around 25% of all the hot water generated in the entire building (including the Department of Finance and Administration tenancy).As a tenant in the John Gorton Building, with a net lease whereby the owner carries the cost of heating and cooling systems, the Department does not have direct access to information on the energy efficiency rating of the air conditioning system.Total tenant light and power for the John Gorton Building tenancies used by the Department:2003-04: 1448,335 kWh = 5500 MJ/person/year**2004-05: 1630,343kWh* = 5233MJ/person/year**        2005-06: 1557,604 kWh* = 5376 MJ/person/year***Includes subsumed Australia Greenhouse Office office (basement) area.** MJ/person/year amounts based on all of the departments Canberra office space at the time (Edmond Barton Building and the John Gorton Building).</DOC>

The United States and China have fuel efficiency standards for new passenger and light commercial vehicles, not carbon dioxide emission standards. The European Union is currently considering the introduction of standards for average carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger and light commercial vehicles. None of these countries have carbon dioxide emission standards for medium and heavy trucks.The Government has not set carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles, whether imported to Australia or made locally. A voluntary national average fuel consumption target was negotiated in 2003 between the Government and the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI). The target for new petrol passenger cars is 6.8 L/100km by 2010. This was estimated to represent an 18% improvement in the fuel consumption of new vehicles between 2002 and 2010.In early 2006 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) requested the Australian Transport Council (ATC) and the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) to jointly report by the end of 2006 on opportunities to increase the uptake of more fuel efficient passenger and freight vehicles in Australia through reform of regulations and new incentives and programmes. A report has been completed and was considered by COAG on 13 April 2007.COAG has requested that EPHC and ATC develop jointly a package of measures designed to move the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of the Australian fleet towards international best practice. The setting of carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles has been raised as a potential measure but the technical feasibility and impacts on the automotive industry would first need to be investigated before any decision could be made.The standards applying to motor vehicles exported from Australia would be a matter for the importing country.</DOC>

It is not government policy to encourage private firms to contact schools and offer to prepare grant applications. The Community Water Grants guidelines allow grant recipients to allocate up to 15 per cent of funding to project administration, however, they may not use the grant to pay for the preparation of an application. The Department is unable to provide the total sum of grant money received as commission by private firms. Project administration costs were not separately identified from other project costs. However, financial acquittals do require project administration costs to ensure the 15 per cent project management cap is not exceeded. Applicants are encouraged to seek letters of support from local community leaders as evidence of community support for the project, which is one objective of the programme. We do not regard generic letters of support themselves as satisfactory evidence of a project's worthiness. The Government does not encourage any firms to draft letters on behalf of applicants, nor is it known how many organisations are involved in such activity.</DOC>

My department last reviewed the human safety of residues of hormone growth promotants in 2003. The review found that there was unlikely to be any appreciable health risk to consumers from eating meat from cattle that have been treated with Hormone growth promotants according to Good Veterinary Practice. There was no new scientific evidence to indicate a need to reconsider the use of Hormone growth promotants but, in view of the complexity of assessments of total dietary hormone intakes and the contentious views expressed in various international forums, the use of Hormone growth promotants in meat producing animals has been kept under ongoing consideration.More recently, epidemiological studies have reported an apparent association between the consumption of red meat and the development of breast cancer. For example, in November 2006 an American study presented evidence that women who ate large amounts of red meat were more than twice as likely to suffer hormone-related breast cancer. The study authors speculated that chemicals added during meat processing or growth hormones given to cattle might be to blame. However, they also commented that cooked or processed red meat is a source of carcinogens, such as heterocyclic amines, N-nitroso-compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, that increase mammary tumors in animals and have been hypothesized to increase breast cancer risk.Earlier this year, a British study also found that women whose consumption of meat (red and processed meat) was at the highest population intake level, were found to be at the highest increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-meat consumers. The study authors noted that there are several mechanisms whereby meat intake may contribute to breast cancer risk. For example meat, and in particular processed meat, can be a rich source of saturated fat, for which an effect on mammary carcinogenesis has been shown in animals although the relevance of this to humans is controversial. Other mechanisms are related to the formation of heterocyclic amines during cooking or nitroso compounds found in processed meat.Since the Government reviewed the human safety of Hormone growth promotants in 2003, there is no new scientific data to contradict the view that there is unlikely to be any appreciable human health risk to consumers from eating meat from cattle that have been treated with these chemicals. There have been new epidemiological studies that provide evidence of an association between red meat consumption and the incidence of breast cancer, but there is no new evidence to link this to the use of Hormone growth promotants. The Government will continue to keep this issue under ongoing consideration.</DOC>

ASIC has advised that the 12 reports that it received from the public concerning various entities in the Westpoint group raised issues about mezzanine financing as a type of financing and whether it should be regulated. No complaints raised concern about the financial viability of the Westpoint group or non-payment of redemptions.Investigations were commenced in late 2003 in relation to the issues of whether the particular promissory notes were regulated products and whether Westpoint entities were required to hold a licence for their promotion and sale (as addressed by a number of the complaints received). These investigations culminated in ASIC's Westpoint mezzanine financing action announced in May 2004.For further information, please refer to the answer to parts (3) and (4) of the Honourable Member's question no. 3590 (House of Representatives).Ms Brailey advised ASIC of her concerns in a telephone call. ASIC recorded the fact of the call and invited Ms Brailey to provide documentary evidence in support of the concerns. I am advised that no formal complaint was ever received by Ms Brailey supporting those concerns. Accordingly, ASIC did not provide information, advice or undertakings to Ms Brailey.</DOC>

ComSuper is unable to source the information for the period 12 March to 30 June 2007, as the water supplier has not issued these figures as yet.A number of discussions have been conducted between ComSuper and the owner of the leased premises to consider water saving initiatives, including installing dual flush cisterns. To date, new initiatives have not been implemented; however ComSuper is working with the owner to progress these activities.
Future Fund Management Agency (FFMA)
FFMA does not have access to this information as the building managers monitor water usage across the building, not specifically the FFMA tenancy.FFMA has installed dual flush capability in the disabled facilities constructed during fit out of the tenancy.
Commonwealth Grants Commission (CGC)
Usage records for the CGC are available only from the 2002-03 year. Prior to that year, the water accounts were paid by the owners/agents of the building and since then, there has been a change in the agent serving the owner and the Commission. The available figures on water consumption are as follows. The increase in water usage in 2006-07 reflects retrieval of staff from another premise, for which water usage was part of rental costs and therefore not obtainable.Financial YearsConsumption (Litres)2002-031,069,0002003-04483,0002004-05450,0002005-06412,0002006-07951,000Although not required for reporting purposes, the Commission is mindful of its need to minimise all energy and water usage. CGC staff are vigilant in reporting faulty taps and toilets immediately, and minimising waste by ensuring taps are turned off correctly. Due to the age of the building, dual flush toilets have been installed on an opportunity basis, when cisterns require replacement. The dishwasher is used only when full. In May 2006, old shower heads were replaced with water miser heads, to reduce the flow. The small garden areas at the front and rear of the building contain established trees and a few native plantings. They are not watered and rely on rainfall only.</DOC>

The Hornet Centre Barrel Replacement program is divided into 3 stages. These are prototype modification, Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production. The prototype stage consists of one aircraft being partially dismantled at Williamtown, the centre barrel being replaced at Mirabel, Canada, and the aircraft being returned to Williamtown (NSW) for re-assembly and test flight. This strategy was implemented to obtain the expertise gained by Canadians in their Centre Barrel Program. The first stage is nearing completion, with the prototype aircraft about to undergo re-assembly at Williamtown. Low Rate Initial Production will commence in August 2007 and includes a minimum of nine aircraft from an overall program of up to 49. This will replicate the prototype strategy of having the aircraft partially disassembled in Williamtown, having the Centre Barrel replaced in Canada and then re-assembled and test flown at Williamtown. The nine Low Rate Initial Production aircraft represents approximately 12 per cent of the total Centre Barrel Replacement Program. This additional Canadian involvement within the low rate production stage represents 5 per cent of the total Centre Barrel Replacement Program. Full Rate Production is planned to be completely conducted in Australia at RAAF Base Williamtown.Initial planning for the Centre Barrel replacement program intended to have all the Low Rate Initial Production activities conducted at Williamtown. However, the decision was made in early June 2007 to continue Low Rate Initial Production using the prototype strategy of having work performed at both Williamtown and Mirabel. The decision was made after analysis of lessons learnt during the prototype activity. Although the modification is now technically proven, the high proportion of spare parts that needed to be procured at short notice during the prototype activity demonstrated that the overall program was still too immature to completely transition to Australia.The most challenging element of the Hornet Centre Barrel Prototype activity has been successfully carried out in Canada. However during this activity the following risks were identified:A large proportion of spare parts such as rivets and specialist fasteners cannot be identified until after each individual aircraft is dismantled. Procurement and long delivery times for these spares introduces significant schedule risk. The prototype activity demonstrated that a large proportion of spares had to be obtained at very short notice from Canadian sources to maintain schedule. Australian stock of these spares is still too limited to support the schedule requirements of the program. Continuation of some Low Rate Initial Production activities in Canada will allow the procurement of the full range of parts required to support the program in Australia without adding risk to schedule.A secondary consideration is the availability of a specialist workforce within Australia. Notwithstanding long term efforts by the Hornet Industry Coalition to employ and train this workforce, there are still workforce shortages in some key trades, such as aircraft structural fitters, at the Williamtown site. Industry sources indicate that this shortage is Australia-wide and may continue until the end of this decade. Continuation of some Low Rate Initial Production activities in Canada will allow alternative strategies to be explored, such as conducting some production activities in areas of Australia that have better access to a suitable workforce.Another secondary consideration is the need to identify suitable facilities to conduct Full Rate Production in Australia. To some extent this will be driven by the strategies implemented to resolve the workforce issues identified above but may consist of adapting existing facilities, constructing new facilities or the leasing of existing commercial facilities.The original intention was to conduct both low and full rate production in Australia. However, the significant risks that emerged as a result of the prototype activity drove the decision to extend the element of work to be done in Canada. This will now include some of the Low Rate Initial Production activities to mitigate schedule risk. The revised strategy will not result in any job losses in the Williamtown area and can be achieved within existing budget.</DOC>

The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) determines the individual membership of the Working Party.The working party has revised its original timetable to ensure a collaborative process. It has indicated that the ADHD guideline review process differs from other clinical guidelines in that it will be essential to ensure consultation with a much broader spectrum of both clinical experts and stakeholders (including parents, carers and families). This requires more intensive facilitation and documentation during the review process.The document for the October 2007 public consultation will be a summation of the important questions and the evidence to be used in addressing them, rather than a draft guidelines statement.The draft guidelines will be available for public consultation in the second quarter of 2008, and the draft guidelines should be put forward for review to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) at their mid year meeting in 2008.The RACP is committed to an evidence based approach to the review of NHMRC Guidelines on ADHD. By making the evidence review available for public consultation in October 2007, the RACP is working to ensure a transparent process to the identification and analysis of the literature relevant to ADHD.</DOC>

No. A one-off non-taxable bonus of $500 was provided to each person qualified for Utilities Allowance or Seniors Concession Allowance on Budget night. Utilities Allowance is paid to income support customers who are of Age or Veteran Pension age. The bonus has been provided for Age and Veteran Pensioners as they have generally left the permanent workforce and therefore may not benefit from employment income. Many people on the Disability Support Pension can, and want to, work.The 2007 - 08 Budget includes a range of measures which will assist people across the Australian community, irrespective of whether or not they have a disability. However, the Budget also includes measures which will benefit people with disability including Disability Support Pension recipients.Measures in the 2007 Budget which are specific to people with disability within the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio include:
Expanding eligibility criteria for Mobility Allowance
Mobility Allowance provides assistance with travel costs for people whose disability means they cannot use public transport. From December 2007, this measure extends eligibility for the higher rate of Mobility Allowance (currently $104.00 per fortnight) to Parenting Payment recipients and Supported Wage System workers (those who have reduced productivity related to their disability). Participation in Vocational Rehabilitation Services to find employment will also be added as an eligible activity for receipt of the standard rate of Mobility Allowance (currently $74.30 per fortnight).
Expanded access to supplementary concessions for Parenting Payment
Currently, Parenting Payment (Single) recipients assessed with partial capacity to work due to disability have access to the Pensioner Concession Card and associated allowances. This access will be extended to Parenting Payment (Partnered) recipients, with partial capacity to work due to disability, from 1 January 2008. In addition, all Parenting Payment recipients assessed with partial capacity to work due to disability will have access to the Pensioner Concession Card for 52 weeks after they earn sufficient income to move off income support.
Additional places in the Personal Support Programme
Personal Support Programme will be funded for an additional 2000 places. Personal Support Programme provides individualised assistance for unemployed people who face multiple non-vocational barriers to participation such as homelessness, drug and alcohol problems, psychological disorders, or domestic violence. Personal Support Programme acts as a bridge between short-term crisis assistance and employment-related assistance.
Additional places in Vocational Rehabilitation Services and the Disability Employment Network
The Government will increase the number of places available in the capped programmes of Vocational Rehabilitation Services and the Disability Employment Network. An additional 1480 places will be provided in Vocational Rehabilitation Services and an additional 987 places in the Disability Employment Network each year, taking the total places available in these programmes to 24 680 and 38 987 respectively. Both programmes assist job seekers who have a moderate to high level of disability and require specialist assistance to find and retain employment.
Vocational Rehabilitation Services and the Disability Employment Network - eligibility for adult prisoners with disability
The Government will extend access to Vocational Rehabilitation Services and Disability Employment Network places to adult prisoners with disability in pre-release centres who are available for work on partial or full day release.</DOC>

The Government is committed to increasing access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in developing countries. The Government will commit up to $800 million over five years to address infrastructure constraints to growth in Asia and the Pacific, including water and sanitation infrastructure, through the Infrastructure for Growth Initiative. The Government will continue to explore opportunities to increase its investment in water and sanitation but will not commit to a specific time-bound target for investment through the aid program. The Government will maintain aid at the highest level that is consistent with the needs of partner countries, our own capacity to assist and overall priorities for Australian Government expenditure.The Australian aid program's response to addressing water and sanitation challenges in the Asia-Pacific region was first articulated in the 2003 water sector policy, Making Every Drop Count: Water and Australian Aid, which promoted a stronger focus on water governance and improved service delivery. In 2006, the White Paper on Australia's aid program identified water aid as being central to the achievement of environment and health objectives, and formed the basis for the development of the aid program's new environment strategy.The aid program's new environment strategy, Aid and the Environment  -  Building Resilience, Sustaining Growth, was launched during August. The strategy highlights investment in water supply and sanitation infrastructure  -  and in the capacities of institutions and communities to better manage these systems  -  as a key challenge in our region, and identifies improved access to safe water and sanitation as a key objective for the aid program.Implementation of water and sanitation initiatives through the aid program will be driven by the Growth and Resource Management Branch within the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), which employs specialist senior advisors with expertise in the water and sanitation sector.The Government will continue to work cooperatively with partner countries and multilateral organisations to improve water and sanitation services. The White Paper on Australia's aid program recognises that working with partner governments and multilateral organisations is essential for an effective aid program.The aid program presently involves partnerships in the water and sanitation sector with the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program, the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission. AusAID is presently finalising arrangements to contribute to the Asian Development Bank's Water Financing Partnership Facility from 2007-08, which will further enable Australia to work in partnership with other donors to address water and sanitation issues in the Asia-Pacific region.</DOC>

The Australian Government has not made any referral to the International Criminal Court under Article 14 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Australian Government notes that a referral by a State pursuant to Article 14 cannot confer jurisdiction on the International Criminal Court where jurisdiction would not otherwise exist.As Iran, Zimbabwe and Burma are not party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, there is little scope for the Court to exercise jurisdiction over situations in those countries.See (b) above.

The 11th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue was held in Beijing on 30 July 2007. The Australian delegation was led by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Deputy Secretary Peter Grey and included Senator Marise Payne, officials from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, DFAT, AusAID, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei led the Chinese delegation which included representatives from nine Chinese Government agencies including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice and Supreme People's Court.While noting areas where China had made progress, we raised our full range of human rights concerns, including civil and political rights, economic and social rights, minority rights and religious freedoms, and the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities. The theme of this year's Dialogue was the role of legal professionals in protecting human rights. This theme facilitated a useful exchange of views on legal reform, judicial independence and the rights of legal professionals to practise freely. The Australian delegation also raised 43 cases of concern representing the range of our human rights concerns including: religious practitioners; members of minorities; environmental, labour and human rights activists; and Falun Gong practitioners. The Chinese delegation raised issues of indigenous health in Australia, housing affordability, and comments regarding Australia's housing policies by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing.The Dialogue also endorsed Australia-China Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program (HRTC) activities for 2007-2008, worth AUD 2 million. The HRTC underpins our formal Dialogue by promoting the advancement of human rights in China at a practical level. New HRTC activities will address victims of crime, women's labour rights, and alternative dispute resolution, amongst other issues. This year is the 10th anniversary of technical cooperation between Australia and China on human rights (now conducted under the HRTC). Previous cooperation has resulted in concrete human rights outcomes, including the passage of provincial-level domestic violence regulations and the introduction of 'know your rights' pamphlets for distribution to prisoners.</DOC>

The High Commission has also raised its concerns about the plight of Rohingya refugees with the Government of Bangladesh on a number of occasions.Non-government organisations in Bangladesh have received Australian funding under the Human Rights Small Grants Scheme. Recent projects have focused on strengthening protection of vulnerable children, promoting women's access to dispute mechanisms and justice, and raising human rights awareness in the legal system.Australian officials will continue to raise human rights issues as appropriate with the Government of Bangladesh and to monitor the human rights situation closely.</DOC>

The Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) has embarked on a program of reform under which professionalisation of its workforce has been a major driver to improving project management performance. Project Managers are certified to levels commensurate with the complexity of the projects they manage. Project managers undergo the following professional development programs:External certification of competency by the Australian Institute of Project Management;Minimum levels of experience; andFormal qualifications in project management.The implementation of the Kinnaird recommendations has seen far more rigour and de-risking of projects in pre-approval stages through the two pass approval process.As a consequence of the improvements made in project management performance, the Government increased the supply of goods and services through the DMO from $6.1 billion in 2003-04 to a forecast $11.3 billion in 2009-10.In 2006-07, the DMO achieved 92 per cent of its Additional Estimates budget for its Approved Major Capital Investment Program, during a time of increased operational tempo of the ADF around the world. Performance in terms of sustainment and through-life support projects was even better, achieving 99 per cent of budget.</DOC>

There are no Department of Veterans' Affairs funding programs for the Beyond Home transition care program. As part of the original Inner West Neighbour Aid grant application, the organisation had committed to ensure the ongoing viability of the project including:seeking recurrent funding from the NSW Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care or the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing;supporting clients using existing resources and infrastructure; andlinking the program to their existing home visiting service.Original funding was therefore granted on the basis of the above conditions.This strategy was written into the Grant Agreement.In response to the organisation's inquiry about alternate sources of funding, the Department provided a list of non-DVA grant programs.No.</DOC>

Yes.Yes, although its maximum take-off weight will be slightly reduced when operating out of RAAF Edinburgh, Pearce and Townsville. These constraints will be remediated through the C-17 Heavy Air Lift Infrastructure project due for completion by mid-2011.Defence uses the Aircraft Classification Number/Pavement Classification Number System to ensure the pavements are not damaged by inappropriate aircraft movements. Using this system, the C-17s can operate on the runway and some taxiways of the subject airbases at reduced weights without damage to the pavement.The C-17 has been operated at Amberley, Darwin, Pearce and Townsville. The C-17s are yet to operate through Edinburgh.The C-17 Heavy Airlift Infrastructure project will deliver the necessary permanent facilities and airfield infrastructure to support C-17 operations at its home base, RAAF Base Amberley, and expanded infrastructure at deployment bases RAAF Bases Edinburgh, Darwin, Pearce and Townsville to allow the large aircraft to operate effectively.</DOC>

Climate change poses a significant challenge to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Changes in air and sea temperatures, ocean currents, sea level, ocean chemistry, cyclones and storms, and rainfall have the potential to cause significant impacts on the GBR. Impacts are already being observed on seabirds, marine turtles and corals from increases in air and sea temperatures. As climate change continues, impacts are expected in all parts of the GBR ecosystem, with consequences for communities and industries that depend on the GBR.The GBR has experienced two major coral bleaching events in recent years: 1998 and 2002. Approximately sixty per cent of the GBR was affected in each event. Although most reefs recovered from bleaching, about five per cent of reefs surveyed suffered severe damage. In the 2006 summer, a severe but localised coral bleaching event in the Keppel Island region affected much of the region and resulted in mortality of approximately forty-two per cent of corals. This is the most damage this region has experienced from coral bleaching.The Government has implemented two key strategies to make the GBR more resilient to climate change. Highly protected areas have been increased from five per cent to more than thirty-three per cent, greatly improving biodiversity protection, and the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan has been implemented, which aims to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the GBR by 2013.
Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region
On 15 September 2006 the 'Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region' was signed by Australia at the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme Ministerial Forum in New Caledonia. This MOU was negotiated under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals 'to foster cooperation, build capacity and ensure coordinated region-wide actions to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status for all cetaceans and their habitats occurring in the region, and to safeguard the associated cultural values for Pacific Islands peoples'.This is a significant step in whale and dolphin conservation in the Pacific and Australia actively participated in the negotiation of this MOU over the past four years in an effort to continue to build support and capacity in the region for the conservation of all cetaceans.
International Whaling Commission Meeting, St Kitts and Nevis (IWC58) 14  -  21 June 2006
In June 2006 Senator Campbell led the Australian delegation to the 58th meeting of the IWC in St Kitts and Nevis where they played a leading role in ensuring continued support for the pro-conservation position. This included effective lobbying of some small island states to abstain on crucial votes on proposed Japanese small type coastal whaling and abolition of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary.The Australian delegation was also closely involved in developing a program of work on ship-strikes for the International Maritime Organisation and the IWC.
Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science
The new Australian Centre for Applied Marine Mammal Science was launched in September 2006. The centre is based in Hobart at the Australian Antarctic Division and is funded through the Australian Government's $100 million Commonwealth Environment Research Facility (CERF) programme. The Government has allocated $2.5 million over four years to the Centre, which will harness the expertise of Australia's very best marine mammal researchers. Applications for research funding for the first year were called for in September and those received have since undergone a rigorous assessment process to determine the successful applicants. The first contracts were signed in May 2007.
Domestic achievements

These are designed to be used by managers and volunteers dealing with stranding events and cetacean researchers.The following table outlines the costs and full-time staffing allocation to both domestic and international whale and dolphin protection programmes during 2005/06: Total Expenditure 2005/06Full-time ASLDomestic whale and dolphin protection programme (Approvals and Wildlife Division)$563,0622.5International Whale Policy Programme (Australian Antarctic Division)$494,0004International Whale Science Programme (Australian Antarctic Division)$925,7556.75TOTAL$1,982,81713.25A summary of the latest scientific estimates of the number of species and communities likely to be threatened by climate change is available on my Department's website at www.greenhouse.gov.au/science/hottopics/pubs/topic11.pdf.The Australian Government recognises that climate change is a threat to biodiversity. The report, Climate Change Risk and Vulnerability that was released in July 2005 identifies biodiversity as a priority area for adaptation planning.The Government has taken action to prepare for the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Most recently, in November 2006, the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council agreed eleven priority actions to deal with natural resource management and climate change. The Australian Government has allocated funds to these actions and commenced implementation.</DOC>

Income-tested fees were introduced on 1 March 1998. Only newly entering residents from that date have been subject to the income test.and (3) The Department of Health and Ageing does not collect information on the amount of income-tested fees paid by residents. The Department sets the maximum income-tested fee that the provider may charge a resident based upon the resident's income and cost of care. The number of residents, who at some point in that year, were assessed as eligible to pay income-tested fees for the Planning Region of Inner West, of which Lowe is an electorate, is shown in the following table. Note that the growth in the number of income tested residents largely reflects the replacement of residents who entered care before 1 March 1998 with residents who entered care since that date.Count of Income-tested residents *Financial Year671998-994351999-20007832000-019092001-021,0092002-031,0672003-041,2512004-051,3692005-061,5022006-07*Note: The number of residents who were income-tested at some time during the year.</DOC>

An asbestos audit of the buildings at the ANZAC Rifle Range has been conducted and management plans developed. As recommended by the audit, work was undertaken to remove and dispose of the hazardous asbestos and to apply appropriate asbestos warning labels to asbestos cement sheeting.Heavy metal testing has been done on a quarterly basis since May 2002, with the most recent heavy metal testing undertaken in April 2007.Heavy metal concentration has not changed significantly in the most recent test compared to previous tests. The concentration of lead and other heavy metals leaving the site in leachate has occasionally been detected at levels that exceed Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) National Water Quality Guidelines for Recreational Water Quality (2000). This is a common occurrence where drains and landfill areas discharge. The Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) has developed a facility management plan for the site and is currently working with State and Local Government agencies to collectively address the exceedences.Part Two of the Facility Management Plan provides a series of action plans that are being implemented. The Facility Management Plan Part Two is progressively updated as tasks are completed and as priorities change and our knowledge of the site improves. Facility Management Plan Part Two has not been prepared for publication but Finance continues to work with stakeholders to ensure that they are aware of the immediate work plans.The relevant Commonwealth agencies have had various consultations with NSW Government agencies since 1998, however, the NSW Government has failed to identify a suitable alternative site that will cater for the full range of shooting disciplines conducted on the ANZAC Rifle Range. (a) See above. (b) The Australian Government has now agreed to permit shooting groups to continue to use the ANZAC Rifle Range.No. The unspent $8.862 million from the Federation Fund has been returned to consolidated revenue.Yes. Finance and the Randwick City Council are discussing a feasibility study and cost sharing arrangements.Finance is continuing to work with Randwick City Council and the Department of the Environment and Water Resources to investigate the feasibility of constructing a walking track in accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.There was no Question 9 received.See answer to Question 8.Part One of the Facility Management Plan has already been completed and is available for perusal by the public (a copy is in the Randwick City Council library). Part Two is an internal management tool used to respond to and address the recommendations contained in Part One.Finance consults with relevant State and local government officials in relation to the management of the Malabar Headland site.No consideration has been given to the use of Malabar Headland as a prospective site for a nuclear power plant.</DOC>

The information below provides the identifiable amount spent on electricity and water for each financial year from July 2004 until 31 December 2006. The figures provided relate to the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and its predecessors as Machinery of Government changes have occurred in that time.For the 2004-05 financial year, identifiable costs (which are not comprehensive) were: electricity $357,973 and water $12,608. In 2005-06 costs were electricity $606,963 and water $9,396 and in 2006-07 (to 31 December 2006), electricity costs have been $485,005 and water $66,666.In the majority of leases held by FaCSIA, the cost of supplying water is included in the overall lease outgoings and is not separately identifiable. In the case of electricity, the majority of leases identify electricity charges as a separate and identifiable cost.The measures instigated by the department to reduce electricity and water usage since 2001 are outlined in the Department's Sustainability Reports for 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05. These reports can be accessed at:http://www.facsia.gov.au/triplebottomline/2005/glance/index.html.Electricity reduction measures include installation of state of the art air-conditioning and lighting systems in the new Centraplaza building, retrofitting double halophosphor tube lighting to single tube lighting in some sites, reducing the number of older stand-alone office peripherals such as printers and faxes, replacing older appliances with more energy efficient versions and the replacement of cathode-ray tube computers with liquid crystal display screens on all new and replacement computers.Water reduction measures include the installation of waterless urinals in one large FaCSIA site, installation of dual flush toilet systems in new fitouts where possible, turning off water features, reducing the watering of landscaping and the implementation of staff awareness initiatives aimed at reducing water consumption.</DOC>

The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Education, Science and Training have exercised their powers under section 1084 of the Social Security Act 1991 to provide exemptions for financial investments in Fincorp from the income test deeming rules for income support recipients. The determinations commenced from 23 March 2007, when the Administrators were appointed.In addition to the deeming exemptions under section 1084, Centrelink clients and potential clients can apply to have their investments in Fincorp disregarded under the asset test hardship rules. The hardship rules can assist people who are affected by the asset test, have assets that are unrealisable and are in severe financial hardship. For the purposes of these rules, investments with Fincorp are regarded as being unrealisable. Affected individuals can apply to Centrelink for consideration under these provisions.This information is generally provided by the Administrators at the second creditors meeting. This has not yet taken place.Section 1084 deeming exemptions and the asset test hardship provisions are long standing provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 which have been used on many occasions to assist Centrelink clients or applicants.</DOC>

In July 2004, Dads in Distress, Coffs Harbour, received funding of $300,000 (GST exclusive) under Local Answers Round One. The funding will cease on 1 August 2007.In July 2006, Dads in Distress Frankston (VIC) received $50,000 under Local Answers Round Three. The funding will cease on 31 October 2007.In May 2007, Dads in Distress was advised in writing that the Local Answers Round Five funding round was open. The outcome of Local Answers Round Five has not yet been announced.Funding under the Local Answers program, part of the Stronger Families and Community Strategy, is from Budget Output Group 4-4-2-SFCS.In June 2006, Dads in Distress received $101,000 for communication of reforms to the Child Support Scheme. Funding will cease in December 2007. The Child Support Scheme Reform Communication: Key Advocacy Group funding is part of Budget Output Group 3.2, Child Support Policy.In March 2007, the Family Relationship Services Branch received a request for funding from Dads in Distress. This proposal was declined for the following reasons:The funding proposal was received outside an advertised competitive selection process, which is critical to ensuring the Australian Government engages providers that can deliver the highest value services to the community for available funding. The level of funding sought ($1,360,000 over three years) could not be met through the Family Relationships Services Program.Significant Australian Government funding is already provided to support men and their families through competitively selected services under the Family Relationships Services Program. The total funding for Men and Family Relationship Services over four years (2005-06 to 2008-09) is over $42 million, including $5 million for new services announced in the 2005-06 New Family Law System Budget.Dads in Distress do not meet the standards documented in the Family Relationships Services Program Approval Requirements, as they primarily deliver voluntary peer support groups. However, Dads in Distress may apply for Men and Family Relationship Services funding as a consortium member or partner organisation for services commencing in 2008-09.</DOC>

Of these, 12,842 benefited by having the full value of their home property exempt from the assets test, and 740 benefited by having part of the value of their home property exempt from the assets test.As of 6 April 2007, 495 people were granted Age Pension for the first time as a result of satisfying the extended land use test under the new concessional assets test treatment. The break-up of grants for full Age Pension or part Age Pension is not available. However, of the 495 people granted Age Pension, 422 benefited by having the full value of their home property exempt from the assets test, and 73 benefited by having part of the value of their home property exempt from the assets test.All people granted Age Pension as a result of the new concessional assets test treatment satisfied the extended land use test. For social security purposes a person can not satisfy both tests. A person can satisfy the extended land use test and have all the adjacent land on the same title as the principal home exempt from the assets test. If a person does not satisfy the extended land use test, they can, under the private land use test, have two hectares of land on the same title as the principal home exempt from the assets test.Centrelink does not collect data on applications for the extended land use test, or reasons why an applicant failed the extended land use test.</DOC>

Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) was the only essential flying capability required for HMAS Sirius. Recent flight trials have given a clearance recommendation for this capability, which includes a helicopter hovering over the ship's deck to transfer underslung loads. During the ship's refit, an area on which helicopters could land was constructed but, as it was not classed as 'essential' no services or maintenance facilities were provided for this function. No ADF helicopters have yet been certified to land on the Sirius.Yes.HMAS Sirius conducted Flight Trials from 30 April 2007 to 23 May 2007 in Bass Strait and Storm Bay, Tasmania using a Seahawk helicopter. During the trial, it was identified that the motion of the ship produced an unpredictable roll that currently precludes the landing of helicopters while underway. It does not prevent the conduct of VERTREP and transfer operations. The trial gathered significant data relating to landings and take offs which will form the basis of further trials should the ship's roll characteristics be improved.The Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) has been tasked to investigate HMAS Sirius' motion, and to recommend possible options for remediation.DSTO will report by early 2008 on possible options. The results of this report will describe what modifications could be made to improve the motion characteristics of the ship. The extent and viability of these modifications, the ship's operational schedule and the need for further trials will determine the way forward.The cost of providing the VERTREP area was approximately $8 million. The cost to upgrade the VERTREP area to a landing area was approximately $0.64 million.</DOC>

and (b) On 21 June 2007 the Australian Government tabled its response to the Productivity Commission inquiry into Tasmanian Freight Subsidy Arrangements. A copy of the response is attached. These reforms will be implemented from 1 July 2008. As identified in the response, the Department of Transport and Regional Services will report to the Commonwealth on the effectiveness of the reforms within three years of the implementation of the revised arrangements.
Productivity Commission Recommendations and Commonwealth Government Response
Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 39
'Tasmanian Freight Subsidy Arrangements'
restructuring the basis for claiming TFES assistance to minimise the adverse incentives the current TFES generates. This will involve ensuring that, as far as is practicable, assistance is paid on the basis of the demonstrated sea freight cost disadvantage as a result of having to ship goods across Bass Strait;enhancing the administration and auditing of the TFES, involving updating and enhancing systems and more comprehensive public reporting of information;revising the methodology for setting and updating the parameters used to calculate TFES assistance;expanding the TWFS to include all bulk and containerised unprocessed wheat shipments, and for eligible shipments to be paid at the same rate and not be subject to the current cap on TWFS payments; andunprocessed wheat will no longer be eligible under the TFES.These reforms will be subject to a report to the Commonwealth in three years from implementation to assess their effectiveness.The Commonwealth intends to implement the changes from 1 July 2008. Prior to this date there will be extensive consultation with stakeholders to ensure the revised Schemes are implemented in a practical manner that minimises any additional burdens on claimants and other parties. The consultation process will focus on:documentation and evidentiary requirements for the revised Schemes;updating and enhancing the information technology systems used to administer the Schemes;designing an appropriate auditing, compliance and fraud prevention programme for the revised arrangements;updating the methodology for calculating the parameters used for the Schemes, and ensuring the parameters are reviewed every three years in future; anddesigning the new methodology for calculating assistance under the TWFS.In addition to these improvements, the Commonwealth has agreed to give further consideration to:specific circumstances facing King and Flinders islands; andassistance for packaging designed and used for multiple northbound trips.The Commonwealth will finalise the details of the revised Schemes early in 2008 following consultations with stakeholders on the matters raised above.The Commonwealth's responses to the individual Commission recommendations are as follows:
Recommendation 1
The basis for claiming TFES payments should be restructured to minimise the adverse incentives that the current Scheme generates.
Recommendation 2
Centrelink should specify the documentary evidence that it will accept as proof of wharf -  to - wharf costs. As far as practicable, this should be based on original carrier wharf - to - wharf invoices.Parameter adjustments of $230 per twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) for door - to - wharf and wharf - to - door costs should no longer apply. Other parameter adjustments would continue to be used.
Recommendation 4
Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) and the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE) should revise the methodology for setting and updating the remaining parameters, and review them every three years. In particular, they should review how wharf - to - wharf costs should be defined. The results of parameter reviews should be published.

The Commonwealth accepts recommendation 1, recommendation 2, and recommendation 4. The TFES is based on alleviating the cost disadvantage associated with being unable to use land transport across Bass Strait, and assistance is based on the sea freight cost disadvantage. The Commonwealth agrees that restructuring the TFES by making actual wharf - to - wharf costs the basis for assessing TFES claims will minimise the potential for a component of land freight costs to receive assistance, contrary to the Scheme objectives. The abolition of the $230 per TEU door - to - wharf and wharf - to - door parameter adjustments is consistent with this.The move to the sole use of actual wharf - to - wharf costs, and the associated removal of the parameter adjustments for land - based costs, will necessitate the introduction of new evidentiary requirements for Scheme claimants and a revision of the methodology for setting the remaining parameters. DOTARS will consult with the transport industry and other stakeholders about the documentary evidence required to support wharf - to - wharf claims. The intention of these consultations will be to ensure that a practical and sustainable approach to documentation is established, that will be consistent with audit and compliance requirements into the future. The Commonwealth will review the parameters every three years and results of the review will be published.The Commonwealth will specify the documentary evidence required for wharf - to - wharf claims and the updated parameters in revised ministerial directions for the TFES to be in place when the revised arrangements are introduced, from 1 July 2008.
Recommendation 3

The system required to administer the Scheme should be updated in the light of the more detailed evidence and data processing needed to verify wharf - to - wharf costs.There should be more comprehensive public reporting of information, including the annual payments to recipients.

payments to claim recipients receiving $1,000 or more in a financial year;the break down of assistance by industry/goods;the results of the methodology and parameter review for 2008 and subsequent reviews; andannual reporting on the Schemes and their audit/compliance.
Recommendation 5
DOTARS should monitor the operation of the revised Scheme to investigate whether there is evidence of ongoing gaming and overcompensation under wharf - to - wharf claiming arrangements. It should report to Government on this matter during 2009.

The effectiveness of administration and audit controls.The role of all actual and potential claimants who are not producers and shippers of goods assisted under the TFES.Any aspects of the ministerial directions judged to be causing difficulty at that time.
If the Government concludes that gaming and overcompensation of freight cost disadvantage remain significant issues, it should introduce a flat - rate of assistance per TEU as per finding 7.1 to operate from 1 July 2010.

The Commonwealth accepts recommendation 5 in part, with the report to the Commonwealth to be made within three years of the implementation of the revised arrangements and with the form and content of the review to be determined by the Commonwealth in 2010. The Commonwealth will monitor the Schemes and any amendments will be considered as part of this review in 2010.
Recommendation 6

Payments under the TWFS should not be capped.Wheat should no longer be eligible for assistance under the TFES.

Given the lack of recent data on these measures, the Bass Strait wharf - to - wharf container rate and the TFES road freight equivalent should be used in the interim. As such, for three years, the TWFS should pay assistance of $23.12 per tonne, or the shipper's actual wharf - to - wharf costs, whichever is the lesser.In concert with the first three - year parameter and operational review of the TFES, the BTRE should estimate the cost of bulk shipments of wheat and the rough rate equivalent, to update the rate of subsidy from that time.

The Commonwealth accepts recommendation 6 in part. The TWFS will be expanded to include both bulk and containerised unprocessed wheat shipments, and the current cap of $1.1 million per annum will be removed. The interim rate to be applied will be determined as part of the methodology review to be undertaken by the BTRE, and implemented from 1 July 2008. This rate will be reviewed on a three yearly cycle along with the parameters for the TFES, and the results of this published.</DOC>

The Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act) does not specify staff ratios or minimum staffing levels, but rather requires that there are sufficient skilled staff to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with the Accreditation Standards.The Australian Government sets out 44 requirements for aged care facilities to meet to receive accreditation. These are not minimum standards, but the level required to operate an aged care facility ensuring appropriate quality care for residents. Ensuring appropriate staffing levels and skills would be a factor considered by aged care facilities in meeting the requirements.The appropriate ratio of staff to residents and the required skill sets of staff are affected by factors such as the nature of the care and service needs of residents, the nature of the buildings, the way work is organised and the extent to which some services are conducted in-house or are outsourced. Thus the number of staff that is appropriate for a given number of residents will vary from home to home and from time to time as changes in the mix of residents' needs within a home occur.The Act has been in effect for the past ten years. The requirements have not changed over this period.</DOC>

A spokesman for the Iranian judiciary said on 29 May 2007 that Dr Haleh Esfandiari and Mr Kian Tajbakhsh were being held in Evin Prison on charges of endangering Iran's national security and espionage. Dr Esfandiari has now been released on bail.Ms Ebadi has said that Iranian officials denied Dr Esfandiari access to legal counsel.Iran is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 14 (3) (g) of the Covenant states that a person facing a criminal charge shall not be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.On 18 and 19 July 2007 Iranian television aired footage of Dr Esfandiari and Mr Tajbakhsh making statements about their activities in Iran. Elements of the Iranian Government described the footage as evidence of Dr Esfandiari and Mr Tajbakhsh's involvement in a plot against the Iranian Government. The human rights situation in Iran has deteriorated markedly since Mr Ahmadinejad's election as President in June 2005. It is clear that the arrest and detention without charge of labour activists, journalists and young people in Iran is increasing.</DOC>

The Australian Government supports a negotiated solution to the Western Sahara issue that is acceptable to all directly interested parties. Australia supports the efforts of the international community through the United Nations to assist in achieving this end.The Australian Government abstained from the United Nations General Assembly resolution on Western Sahara in 2006 in profound regret that the parties to the resolution were unable to reach agreement concerning the question of Western Sahara. The Australian Government would have preferred a consensus resolution as is traditional on such issues.I am aware of the opinion of Hans Corell, former United Nations Under-Secretary General of Legal Affairs, dated 29 January 2002. I note the opinion is not legally binding and does not set out measures to be taken by states to prohibit imports from Western Sahara. Nonetheless, my department has placed a notice on the DFAT website stating that there are international law considerations to take into account when engaging in commercial activities in Western Sahara. Companies are advised to seek independent legal advice. There are no United Nations Security Council sanctions or Australian bilateral sanctions prohibiting imports from Western Sahara or Morocco.and (b) The Government takes an ongoing interest in the human rights situation in Western Sahara and is aware of reports of human rights violations in this territory. The Government emphasises the need for all parties to the dispute to show commitment to the promotion and protection of internationally recognised standards of human rights. (c) The Government urges Morocco and Polisario to cooperate with the UN in efforts to resolve the issue. Parties held direct negotiations in New York under UN auspices in June and August 2007 and the next round of talks is scheduled to be held later this year.</DOC>

According to its website, the World Bank has committed approximately US$1.35 billion to nine projects in Iran. One project, to improve environmental management, has operations in Isfahan. (b) The nine projects, approved between 2000 and 2005, are scheduled to end between 2007 and 2012. Based on World Bank statistics of 30 June 2007, approximately US$507 million has been disbursed thus far. A further US$848 million is available for the completion of these projects.Australia strongly supports pressure brought by the international community on Iran to suspend its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities, cooperate with the IAEA and resolve concerns about its nuclear program. The international community agrees that currently the most effective forum for such pressure remains the United Nations Security Council.</DOC>

I am aware of the relevant Human Rights Watch report on Sri Lanka.The Government continues to express its concerns at the deteriorating human rights situation in Sri Lanka and its impact on civilians. On 10 July this year, for example, I wrote to the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister noting my concern about the return to conflict, the associated humanitarian crisis and the increasing incidence of reported human rights violations in Sri Lanka.My department has noted the recommendations of Human Rights Watch report and will continue to have regard to them. The Government regularly calls on all parties to take action to prevent the abuse of human rights in Sri Lanka. In a media release of 23 May 2007, I expressed concern at the trend towards increasing violence and the growing environment of impunity surrounding human rights violations in Sri Lanka. I called on all parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka to resume peace talks without delay to seek a solution which addresses the legitimate aspirations of all Sri Lankans.The Government has also provided practical assistance in this regard. I announced in May 2007 that Australia would contribute $5.25 million to provide life-saving and other essential humanitarian services for those affected by the intensifying conflict in Sri Lanka. This included $1 million through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to help protect civilians from violations of international humanitarian law and to allow the ICRC to visit detainees and act for families of missing persons, $1.25 million to UNICEF for provision of child protection services for displaced people and separated families and $2.5 million to United Nations High Commission for Refugees to provide protection and other assistance to displaced people in the north and east of Sri Lanka. These contributions brought total Australian humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka to $17.8 million in 2006/07.</DOC>

Yes.The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) already has ongoing involvement in Sri Lanka and a number of UN special rapporteurs and envoys have visited Sri Lanka and provided reports on aspects of the human rights situation. Australia is pleased that the Sri Lankan Government has invited the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbor, to visit Sri Lanka in October 2007. My department will continue to monitor the efforts of OHCHR and other UN bodies in Sri Lanka and to support their activities there, as appropriate. Australia has welcomed Sri Lanka's Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights violations and has nominated an eminent jurist, Professor Ivan Shearer, to the Independent International Group of Eminent Persons to assist the Commission of Inquiry.The Government continues to express its concerns about internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka. Between 2005 and 2007, Australia has provided more than $A30 million to experienced and reputable multilateral aid agencies and international non-government organisations, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration and the International Committee of the Red Cross, to provide humanitarian relief to civilians affected by the conflict. The Government also continues to call on both parties to the conflict to return to negotiations, which would assist displaced people return to their homes.Yes. The Australian High Commission in Colombo continues to express Australia's concerns about access for humanitarian workers to the highest levels of the Sri Lankan Government, including in the context of Australia's substantial support for humanitarian assistance for conflict-affected persons through United Nations and other multilateral aid agencies.See my response to part 3 of Question No. 6276.</DOC>

These Strategies have been in place since 2004 and were updated in late 2006.The key objective of the Defence Energy Strategy is to consume the least amount of energy necessary while maintaining the capability to defend Australia and its national interests. Defence is committed to:minimising energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and demand;achieving enduring cultural change in energy management across the entire organisation;meeting obligations under the Commonwealth policy Energy Efficiency in Government Operations; anddemonstrating to all stakeholders continual improvement in energy performance against appropriate targets and benchmarks.To achieve these objectives Defence has:The key objectives of the Defence Sustainable Water Management Strategy comprise:maximising the efficiency of water use;eliminating losses through leakage and waste; andreducing potable water use by substituting lower grade sources of water where they remain fit for purpose (for example collection and use of rain water and storm water, recycling of grey water and waste water).
 
identified 45 high water use sites across the Defence estate;commenced the identification of opportunities at these sites for reducing potable water consumption and increasing the use of rainwater and stormwater, and the recycling of grey water and waste water;set a 30 per cent water saving target in potable water in new buildings and major refurbishments;specified water efficient fittings, fixtures and appliances which have a minimum AAA rating or equivalent water efficiency labeling and standards scheme star rating; anddeveloped regional and site water management plans for the Defence estate.Examples of water efficiency projects that have been implemented across the Defence estate include:the implementation of waste water recycling for irrigation of the sports ground at the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy;the installation of recycled water washpoint facilities at Gallipoli Barracks and Lavarack Barracks;rainwater harvesting for HMAS Cairns redevelopment and Oakey Army Aviation Centre;the installation of waterless urinals at RAAF Richmond and Enoggera Army Barracks; andthe installation of dual flush toilets in various facilities.</DOC>

In 2005 the electrical system on RAAF Darwin required an upgrade to enable it to meet the increasing demands of modern households. During this period, the base experienced a number of planned and unplanned power outages. In an attempt to avoid unplanned outages, residents were requested to manage their household electrical loads during peak usage periods.The allowance that compensates Service personnel living in remote locations is known as Australian Defence Force (ADF) district allowance and is considered by the Australian Taxation Office to be income. Accordingly, receipt of the allowance may reduce a member's entitlement to Family Tax Benefit in the same way that an increase in taxable income will affect the entitlement to Family Tax Benefit of any other Australian taxpayer.Yes. ADF district allowance is paid in accordance with a scale based on the isolation of the location and the severity of its climate. Locations are graded into five levels.With the exception of a small number of ADF members working in Shoalwater Bay Training Area near Rockhampton, ADF members in all remote locations received an increase in ADF district allowance. A component of the increase in some locations was an amount to compensate for the discontinuation of air conditioning allowance and was calculated based on the average amounts of air conditioning allowance previously claimed. This figure was then 'grossed up' at the top marginal tax rate to negate the effects of the ADF district allowance being subject to income tax, while air conditioning allowance was not. Individuals who were extremely high users of air conditioners may not have had a net increase in entitlement.No. The discontinuation of the air conditioning allowance in favour of an increased ADF district allowance has made administration marginally easier for Defence and for ADF members. Air conditioning allowance was discontinued, and ADF district allowance increased, to better compensate Service personnel for the rigours of living in a remote location. Conditions in the north were reviewed to make service there more attractive. The total package, including the increase in ADF district allowance, cost Defence an additional $35 million per annum.</DOC>

to (c) The Government is committed to the future of RAAF Tindal and there will be no downgrade of facilities at the base.In fact, on 21 June 2007, a $64.2 million project to build facilities at RAAF Tindal for the Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works.The project will provide a range of new facilities at RAAF Tindal such as taxiways, aprons and shelters to enable the Wedgetail aircraft to operate from the base.This project clearly demonstrates that RAAF Base Tindal remains a very important part of Air Force's network of bases.In late 2006 there was a small reduction of 30 maintenance personnel at the base as a result of a more efficient F/A-18 Hornet maintenance structure. The current number of uniformed Air Force personnel on the base is 607, with a further 119 Defence civilian and contractor staff.</DOC>

May 2003.HMAS Sydney returned to service at provisional acceptance in December 2006. This was with identified deficiencies in the underwater warfare systems, electronic support system and Australian distributed architecture combat system software. Thales Australia is required to rectify shortfalls before acceptance (scheduled to occur by November 2008). HMAS Sydney recently completed Navy Unit Readiness Evaluation and was assessed ready to conduct short notice tasking requirements including trials and exercises.Yes.The initial in-service date for the Guided Missile Frigate SM-2 lead ship is 2009.Deploying SM2 missiles from the upgraded FFG is not part of the scope of the Sea 1390 Phase 2 FFG Upgrade Project. Sea 1390 Phase 4B, approved by the Government in July 2004, is being progressed in parallel with the FFG Upgrade Project and will deliver the capability to integrate and fire the SM2 missile from the FFG platform.Technical and performance issues are still to be resolved for the underwater systems and electronic support system for the first of the three baselines of software intended. The second software baseline build is now being tested.Yes.The service potential embodied in the ship sets 5 and 6 equipment will be realised by Defence. Alternative use options include the following:A MK41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) has been installed at the Anzac System Support Centre at HMAS Stirling for the in-country conduct of MK 41 VLS system training for the Royal Australian Navy.The establishment of a shore-based MK-92 Fire Control System to deliver in-country maintenance and operation training, replacing that previously provided in the United States, and as mitigation against assessing government furnished equipment condition.Items of the FFG Upgrade Ship 6 equipment, namely the Lockheed Martin Solid State Continuous Wave Illumination and the AAI Corporation On - Board Training System equipment, are necessary for FFG SM - 2 system development and test in the US. These items have been pre-positioned at the Original Equipment Manufacturer's facilities in accordance with the Sea 1390 Phase 4B acquisition strategy.Equipment items are also proposed to be employed in FFG support and development activities.No.The sum spent on the FFG Upgrade project at 30 April 2007 was $1060.355 million.The Government approved the initial budget for the FFG upgrade project of $1266 million in December 1997.Liquidated damages will be pursued within the provisions of the contract if the contract requirements are not met. To date, the liquidated damages provisions have not been contractually triggered.In 2006, the FFG Upgrade contract was renegotiated through a partial termination contract change proposal. A settlement was reached, with adjustments to contract price, which included descoping from six to four ship upgrades, revised milestones and schedules, and extant claims and commercial issues were addressed.</DOC>

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) School of Languages at RAAF Williams in Melbourne runs training programs in the languages considered to be priorities for Defence. The ADF nominates members to attend language programs at the school on the basis of Defence's foreign language capability requirements. Members who have graduated from the school are encouraged to maintain and enhance their skills, through the provision of a Language Proficiency Allowance and access to skills maintenance packages. In addition, the Army and the Air Force make provision for members posted overseas to access in-country follow-on training to maintain and enhance skill levels.Members may also seek support to undertake language studies on a part-time basis, on their own initiative. This may occur under the auspices of Civil Schooling, or the Defence Assisted Study Scheme.Yes, it is possible for a member to study Arabic at an undergraduate level, through Civil Schooling or the Defence Assisted Study Scheme.Defence has sought to improve the level of Arabic language competency in the ADF since commencing operations in the Middle East Area of Operations in 2001. The ADF School of Languages has run courses in Arabic since 2002. They comprise ad hoc courses, which provide members with: a very limited communication capability, usually memorised phrases; a basic course that produces graduates with some effective communication capability in a limited range of subject areas and topics; and a longer general language course that produces graduates who are capable of being quite effective communicators on general and familiar or specialist topics. Since 2002, there have been 502 graduates from the ad hoc course, 184 graduates from the basic course and 47 graduates from the general course. There are currently 12 students enrolled in the general course for 2007.</DOC>

Yes.Under the provisions of the National Health Amendments (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Act 2007 (the Act), where a statutory price reduction is applied to a PBS-listed item, any special patient contributions associated with brands of that item will also be reduced by the same percentage. Companies will be unable to 'pass on' statutory price reductions to patients at the time of those price reductions.Under Section 85B of the Act, where a price agreement for a PBS-listed item cannot be reached with the responsible person, the Minister may determine that a special patient contribution applies. There are policies that govern the application of brand premiums and therapeutic group premiums that require that there is always an alternative for patients at the standard co-payment amount. These policies are outlined in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority's annual report available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/content/health-pbs-general-pricing.htmI am unaware of specific examples where 'branded drugs' are recommended by prescribers for use by patients because the alternative generic brand would be unsuitable due to the patient's specific medical condition. This would be a clinical decision for the prescriber and the prescriber has the ability to specify this when completing the prescription.No brands of a PBS-listed item will be exempt from the statutory price reductions, which apply to that drug.Applications for new or increased special patient contributions are considered individually and the Act provides that this is a matter for Ministerial determination. It is not possible to predict the outcome of an application which has not been made.There will always be a brand of a PBS-listed item or, in the case of therapeutic groups, another PBS-listed item that is able to be used by the patient, available at the standard co-payment amount, without patients having to pay a special patient contribution. In addition, for therapeutic group premiums and 'other special patient contributions' there are arrangements whereby prescribers can apply, on clinical grounds, for patients to be exempt from paying the special patient contribution. Patients can discuss their clinical options relating to the appropriate brand of a PBS-listed item with their prescriber and pharmacist.</DOC>

Water usage is monitored locally at Defence sites.Data is not aggregated nationally. Water usage across the whole of Defence was in the order of 9.2 gigalitres in 2005 (based on a water use and consumption profile study of Defence facilities).Defence is proactively addressing water management issues through the Defence Environmental Management System, site environmental management plans and the Defence Sustainable Water Management Strategy. This strategy was launched in February 2004 and was recently updated in December 2006.
 maximising the efficiency of water use; eliminating losses through leakage and waste; and reducing potable water use by substituting lower grade sources of water where they remain fit for purpose (for example the collection and use of rainwater and stormwater, recycling of grey water and waste water).To achieve these objectives Defence has: identified 45 high-water-use sites across the Defence estate; commenced the identification of opportunities at these sites for reducing potable water consumption and increasing the use of rainwater and stormwater, and the recycling of grey water and waste water; set a 30 per cent water saving target in potable water in new buildings and major refurbishments; specified water efficient fittings, fixtures and appliances which have a minimum AAA rating or equivalent water efficiency labelling and standards scheme star rating; and developed regional and site water management plans for the Defence Estate.Examples of water efficiency projects that have been implemented across the Defence Estate include: the implementation of waste water recycling for irrigation of the sports ground at the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy; the installation of recycled water washpoint facilities at Gallipoli Barracks and Lavarack Barracks; rainwater harvesting for HMAS Cairns redevelopment and Oakey Army Aviation Centre; the installation of waterless urinals at RAAF Richmond and Enoggera Army Barracks; and the installation of dual flush toilets in various facilities.</DOC>

When a customer's regular application for payment form (often including a declaration of earnings) falls due on a national public holiday, Centrelink accepts the forms one working day prior to the national public holiday occurring.  This ensures payments can be received on time.  However, early form lodgement can lead to customers being overpaid, because their circumstances can change between the time they lodge a form and the form's actual, due date. Given the large number and variability of local public holidays, establishing early lodgement arrangements in only some locations, increases complexity and the risk of customers being overpaid.  For this reason, Centrelink accepts forms the working day immediately following a local public holiday.Centrelink can facilitate immediate payments for customers in financial hardship and can accept applications for immediate payment in the instance of local public holidays.For the reasons outlined in parts one and two, assurance cannot be given early lodgement can always be provided.</DOC>

The 100 per cent increase referred to by Mr Gibbons appears to be the figure for out-of-pocket costs on page 53 of the ALP's Family Watch Taskforce Report. This figure seems to refer to out-of-pocket costs for all health services, not just those for which the Commonwealth Government provides direct financial assistance through Medicare.The parts of the health sector with the largest and fastest growing out-of-pocket payments are those in which the Commonwealth Government is either not involved, such as aids and appliances, or has only recently become involved, such as dental services.This Government is committed to promoting affordable and accessible health care for all Australians. As a result of the Strengthening Medicare initiatives introduced in 2004, bulk billing for visits to general practitioners increased from 66.5 per cent in the December quarter 2003 to 77.4 per cent in the March quarter 2007.With the higher rate of bulk billing, there are fewer services where patients face co - payments. Many services that previously attracted small co-payments are now being bulk billed. This has a perverse impact on Medicare statistics with the average co - payment made by consumers appearing to increase.The Commonwealth Government recognises that some individuals and families face high health care costs. To make sure that these people continue to receive the services that they need at an affordable cost, and in addition to the bulk-billing incentives, the Government introduced the Extended Medicare Safety Net (EMSN) in 2004.Under this initiative, once individuals and families reach the annual threshold, the Commonwealth Government pays 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for all non-hospital Medicare services.The increase in out-of-pocket costs for visits to general practitioners between the December quarter 2006 and the March quarter 2007 largely reflects the start of a new Medicare Safety Net year on 1 January and is seasonal in its effect.Since 1996, the Commonwealth Government has provided strong financial incentives, including the 30 per cent rebate, to increase private health insurance coverage and to ensure the future viability of Australia's health system.In 2006-07, $1.4 billion was spent on 'Strengthening Medicare' initiatives. These initiatives include bulk-billing incentives, practice nurse items, allied health services, the EMSN, 100 per cent rebates for non-referred (GP) attendances, the new Medicare Benefits Schedule item for planning and management of pregnancy and the new after hours non-referred (GP) attendance items.The extended Medicare safety net protects families and individuals from high out-of-pocket medical expenses for out-of-hospital services.In 2006, around 1.5 million Australians qualified for the EMSN and 445,687 families and 65,467 singles were helped by the EMSN. Almost $260 million was paid out in safety net benefits.Like the assistance available to individuals and families for medical services under the EMSN, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Safety Net operates in a similar way to help people facing high costs for their prescription medicines. Once the safety net threshold is reached (currently $1,059 for general patients and $274.40 for concession card holders for this calendar year), patients can apply for a PBS Safety Net Card. With the card, prescription medicines cost $4.90 for general patients and are free for concession card holders for the remainder of the calendar year.In addition to the safety nets, the Net Medical Expenses Tax Offset scheme allows Australian residents to claim a tax offset of 20 per cent  -  20 cents in the dollar  -  of net medical expenses over $1,500. There is no upper limit on the amount that can be claimed and claimable items are not restricted to items covered by Medicare. Most expenses relating to an illness or operation paid to legally qualified doctors, nurses or chemists and public or private hospitals can be claimed.</DOC>

Males: 2nd  -  9.4% of total burden of disease and injury.Females: 8th  -  2.1% of total burden of disease and injury.The Commonwealth Government supports the treatment and rehabilitation needs of people with ASD through providing funding for these services under special agreements with the State and Territory Governments. Specialised services for people with ASD are managed and provided by State and Territory Governments.Issues of treatment and rehabilitation of children with autism is primarily a matter for the States and Territories. Australia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which article 23, provides that states shall ensure that children with physical or mental disabilities have a full and decent life, and have access to information regarding methods of rehabilitation. While the Convention cannot operate as a direct source of rights in Australian law, when ratifying the Convention, Australia was satisfied that its laws, policies and practices complied with the Convention. Australia has also recently signed the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, of which article 26 provides that states should strengthen rehabilitation programs.The new Medicare health assessment items 718 and 719 were made be available from 1 July 2007 for people with an intellectual disability.For the purposes of these items, a person will be deemed to have an intellectual disability if they have significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning (two standard deviations below the average intelligence quotient (IQ)) and would benefit from assistance with daily living activities.ASD is not regarded as an intellectual disability and ASD of itself is not an eligible condition for the intellectual disability health assessment items, however, many patients with ASD have a co-morbid intellectual disability and will be eligible to access these items.There is currently no plan to create a separate rebate scheme for people with ASD who are unable to 'recognise and communicate symptoms'. However, a psychiatric attendance MBS item (319) is available for persons under 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder (including autism and Asperger's disorder). For persons 18 years and over, they must also have been rated with a level of functional impairment within the range 1 to 50 according to the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale to be eligible for this service. This item allows for an attendance of more than 45 minutes duration at consulting rooms. As part of normal medical care, Medicare can also assist with the cost of visits to general practitioners and other medical specialists such as paediatricians to whom patients with autism are referred.</DOC>

I am advised by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) of the following:Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are an increasingly common technology using radiofrequency radiation (RFR)  -  a type of electromagnetic energy. Some recent studies have investigated exposure from WLANs and found that the levels are extremely low; in general almost a million times lower than the appropriate radiofrequency exposure standard. It would be almost impossible to conduct meaningful research at such low levels. Our knowledge of the interaction of RFR with the human body is very extensive. Human exposure to the actual technology used is not expected to have any unique health outcomes.There are no known health risks associated with wireless internet technology.Wireless communications are based on a range of technologies. The different systems deliver RFR in a variety of packages or modulations. There is no substantial evidence to suggest that the type of modulation has an impact on the interaction with the body to an extent of resulting in adverse health outcomes.Advice from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), is as follows:The ACMA administers the national electromagnetic energy (EME) health exposure regulatory arrangements for radiocommunications transmitters. The EME regulatory arrangements require providers of telecommunications services to limit electromagnetic energy emissions to levels well below those where any known adverse health effects might arise.The EME regulations and associated standards are based on international experience and best-practice and are considered to provide adequate safety measures to protect end-users of Australian telecommunication services.Under the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the operation of wireless internet can be authorised under one of three licensing arrangements, known as spectrum, apparatus and class licences. Higher power radio transmitters can be permitted under a spectrum or apparatus licence whilst class licences restrict transmitter operation to lower power.Those internet wireless base stations that operate under a spectrum or apparatus licence must comply with the EME requirements of the Radiocommunications Licence Conditions (Apparatus Licence) Determination 2003 which makes the exposure limits prescribed by ARPANSA in the Radiation Protection Standard for Maximum Exposure Levels to Radiofrequency Fields - 3 kHz to 300 GHz (2002) mandatory for such installations.Those wireless internet providers who operate under a class licence issued by ACMA are restricted to levels of radiated power of 4 watts which is small compared to other communications systems. ACMA is presently amending class licence conditions to make compliance with ARPANSA's EME limits a mandatory condition of operation for these types of low power wireless internet base stations. It has made available self-assessment guides to inform providers of the steps they need to take to ensure compliance with the emission limits.ACMA monitors compliance of certain types of radiocommunications base stations to deliver wireless internet by auditing the compliance records which they are required to maintain. By close of this financial year, ACMA will have conducted some 400 EME health exposure audits of base stations.The widespread use of low power wireless internet installations is not considered to pose adverse health risks to end-users of the technology.Under the Radiocommunications (Compliance Labelling - Electromagnetic Radiation) Notice 2003 manufacturers and importers of consumer wireless internet devices designed for use in close proximity to the human body (such as wireless internet enabled laptops) are required to have their products assessed for compliance with prescribed exposure limits before these products can be placed on the Australian market. They are also required to maintain compliance records for ACMA audit purposes.Significant penalties will apply for breaches of the EME regulatory arrangements.</DOC>

It is not the AFP's role to monitor the treatment of persons in custody whilst overseas. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) provides a range of assistance to Australians detained overseas to help ensure their welfare is protected. However, on rare occasions, including in Mr Habib's case, where foreign authorities have not allowed DFAT to conduct consular visits to an Australian detainee, Australian security and law enforcement officials have assisted in providing DFAT with information regarding the detainee's welfare obtained during interviews with the detainee. Any complaints made by Mr Habib to AFP members were forwarded to DFAT.Not applicable.</DOC>

I have read the article titled 'Chinese textiles could pose cancer risk', which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 May 2007.I am now aware that formaldehyde is a potential carcinogen and can also cause skin and respiratory irritations. (b) I am also aware that textiles recently imported from China have been reported to contain high levels of formaldehyde.Customs controls the importation of certain goods at the border on behalf of a range of Government agencies. Customs considers recommendations for new prohibitions or restrictions on goods following representations from the Government agency having policy responsibility for those goods. There are no current restrictions on the importation of textiles containing formaldehyde.Responsibility for this matter rests with both the Department of Health and Ageing and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</DOC>

It is usual for the department to give reasonable notice to an employment service provider when the department requires access to the provider's premises, sites or records as part of the normal contract management process. However, the general conditions to the Employment Service Contract 2006-2009 note that the provision of reasonable prior notice does not apply where a matter is being investigated which may involve a breach of the law, or suspected fraud.The risk that prior warning of an audit may allow an employment service provider an opportunity to falsify records must be balanced with providing appropriate notice to such organisations as part of the normal contract management process. This balance has been addressed within the context of the department's risk management analysis, and adequate controls are in place.The department has in place a range of mechanisms to both prevent and detect fraud. While it is not appropriate to detail these mechanisms (as to do so may undermine the integrity of such controls), some examples include record retention requirements, data matching of electronic records submitted to the department with paper records kept by the provider, and robust programme assurance and compliance processes undertaken within the contract management and fraud control environment.</DOC>

Under existing emergency arrangements the NSW Government is responsible for the provision of medical services within its borders. These arrangements are not altered for large scale events such as the Olympics or APEC leaders week. If an event occurs that threatens to overwhelm or exhaust the resources of the NSW Health system, national coordination arrangements, including the possible redistribution of patients, are activated.In a large scale event, trauma services in Sydney are coordinated by the NSW Department of Health (NSW Health Counter Disaster Unit - CDU). I am advised that the CDU has undertaken extensive planning in conjunction with the APEC Taskforce in preparation for APEC 2007. Representatives from my department have participated regularly in APEC Taskforce planning meetings during 2007 and liaised frequently with the CDU.I am advised that under the NSW health plan, each of Sydney's nine major trauma hospitals have a dedicated role. Under the plan NSW Health and the Ambulance Service will provide a range of patient transport services for APEC leaders and officials and each of the metropolitan health services will maintain dedicated medical response teams during APEC Leaders Week on a 24 hour basis. Medical clinics will be established at secure APEC venues, staffed by GPs, nurses and paramedics.In a large scale incident the ambulance services will be coordinated by the NSW CDU. If an event occurs that threatens to exhaust the resources of the NSW Health system, national coordination arrangements, including possible redistribution of patients, are activated.</DOC>

The Commonwealth Government has not considered establishing labelling requirements for alcoholic beverages at this point. The Commonwealth Government has however recently supported and endorsed the 'standard drink' logos developed by industry as a voluntary labelling initiative.In respect of (a) there have been no specific reports produced for the Commonwealth Government on the benefits of labelling alcoholic beverages.In respect of (b) the Commonwealth Government co-ordinates its approach to labelling of alcoholic products through Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ).FSANZ, the joint Australian and New Zealand agency responsible for food labelling in both countries, is currently considering an application to require information on low risk drinking levels on alcoholic beverage containers.Further steps may be considered in light of the outcomes of the current review of the National Alcohol Guidelines being undertaken by the NHMRC. The development of any strategies emerging from the review will be shaped by the National Alcohol Strategy 2006-2009.</DOC>

Yes.Funding of $486,500 was provided to Orrcon Operations Pty Ltd (Orrcon) Port Kembla site from the PKIFF to undertake a project titled 'Commercialise an opportunity to end form steel pipes'. In their application, Orrcon estimated that the project would result in 14 sustainable direct jobs and a number of indirect jobs when the plant reached full capacity.I am aware that Orrcon also operates a pipe mill at Unanderra which manufactures product for the gas and oil industry and that this facility has unfortunately had to reduce shifts and lay off a number of workers due to a downturn in demand for its product.My department has determined that eight new staff members have been employed at the Port Kembla site and an additional three transferred from Orrcon's Unanderra pipe mill.My department has been advised that further new staff will be employed as the plant ramps up to full capacity in response to winning additional tenders to supply water pipe. I am advised that Orrcon is not in breach of the funding agreementSee answer to 5.I am advised that the other eight projects funded by the PKIFF are yet to be completed but are progressing well and it is expected that all project commitments will be met.

Request relating to Port Kembla Industry Facilitation Fund
Orrcon applied for funding of $486,500 under the PKIFF. The funding was to 'fully commercialise an opportunity to end form steel pipes' at their Port Kembla site. In their application, Orrcon estimated that the project would result in 14 sustainable direct jobs when the plant reached full capacity. The planned production facility capitalises on in-house R&amp;D and will have the capacity to cold form the ends of pipe of various diameters for the water industry.An offer of funds to Orrcon was made on 22 December 2006 and accepted on 8 January 2007. The Funding Agreement with the Commonwealth was signed 12 March 2007.The original estimated project budget was $973,000 with the PKIFF funds representing 50% of this amount.The final milestone for the project was 'Commercialisation'During our end of project visit and compliance check the company provided evidence of:commercialisation, in the form of contracts to supply two major water pipeline projects and plans for tendering for others,expenditure, in the form of invoices for project related items.; andemployment of eight new staff members plus three transferred from Orrcon's Unanderra pipe mill. Further new staff will be employed as the plant ramps up to full capacity in response to Orrcon's winning additional tenders to supply water pipe. Final staff levels are expected to meet or exceed the original estimate.The company has been paid all PKIFF monies except a 10% retention amount pending receipt of a final financial audit from an independent auditor.As a result of our end of project and compliance visit my officers are confident that all contractual obligations have been met and that funding paid to the Orrcon head office in Brisbane has been expended at the Port Kembla site.Yours sincerelyBill PeelExecutive General ManagerAusIndustryOctober 2007</DOC>

 (i) be entered on the role of practitioners in their local Supreme Court and (ii) be issued a practising certificate from the local regulatory authority (typically the State or Territory Law Society). Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, which have not yet implemented legislation based on the Model Bill (but have advised that they will do so in the near future) use 'of good fame and character and fit and proper', 'of good character' and 'of good fame and character and is a fit and proper person', respectively. The entitlement to practise in a federal court depends, in turn, upon an entitlement to practise in the Supreme Court of a State or Territory (described above), and entry in the Register of Practitioners kept in the High Court. In addition, under the Judiciary Act 1903, certain Commonwealth officers and lawyers of the Australian Government Solicitor may appear in federal, State and Territory courts.Regulation of the conduct and professional standards of legal practitioners is the direct responsibility of State and Territory Governments. Nevertheless, I have been working closely with my State and Territory counterparts to ensure that a consistently high level of conduct and professionalism is required in all jurisdictions. The outcome of that work is reflected in the various State and Territory Legal Profession Acts.Regarding legal practitioners who are engaged by the Commonwealth, I have issued the Legal Services Directions 2005, which require, in litigation, Commonwealth agencies (and, by extension, their legal representatives when acting on their behalf) to behave as model litigants. Further, the Directions require that the Commonwealth must not brief a barrister who has been bankrupt and whose bankruptcy was the subject of an adverse disciplinary finding by the relevant State or Territory regulatory authority, without my approval.Yes.I am advised that New South Wales has no rules barring legal practitioners from also practising as migration agents or marriage celebrants. The Commonwealth similarly has no bar on migration agents or marriage celebrants also being legal practitioners.When a person's practising certificate is revoked in New South Wales, the Legal Profession Regulations 2005 (NSW) allow the Law Society of NSW to share information regarding that refusal with the Migration Agents Regulatory Authority (MARA). I am advised that, in addition, the MARA regularly checks the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Register on the website of the Office of the Legal Services Commissioner. Where a registered migration agent has been disciplined by the Law Society, the MARA will conduct its own investigation concerning the disciplinary action to determine whether the lawyer-migration agent is not a fit and proper person to provide 'immigration assistance', or is not a 'person of integrity' as defined by the Migration Act 1958. If the MARA concludes that either, or both, is the case, it will sanction the agent. The sanction imposed may be a caution, suspension or cancellation of registration.Lawyer-migration agents, when applying for registration or re-registration as a migration agent, must disclose to the MARA whether they are subject to investigation or disciplinary measures related to their legal practice. The MARA then investigates these issues and considers whether the solicitor's conduct is sufficient for the MARA to refuse registration, and/or bar the agent from returning to the industry for a certain period of time if they are applying for re-registration.A Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrant may be deregistered for a number of reasons set out in subsection 39I (1) of the Marriage Act 1961, including that the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants is satisfied that the marriage celebrant is no longer entitled to be registered. If a NSW solicitor, registered as a Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrant, was removed from the roll or refused a practising certificate then the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants could consider whether the behaviour which caused the that removal or refusal, also caused him or her to no longer meet the 'fit and proper' person test in the Marriage Act.The New South Wales Attorney-General does not, in the ordinary course, raise individual decisions of that type directly with me. When a solicitor is removed from the roll of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Registrar of the Supreme Court is required to notify the Registrar of the High Court. When a solicitor is refused a practising certificate in New South Wales, the Legal Profession Regulations 2005 (NSW) allow the Law Society of NSW to share information regarding that refusal with the Registrar of the High Court.I do not, in the ordinary course, raise individual decisions of that type directly with the New South Wales Attorney-General. I am advised that the MARA advises the relevant legal disciplinary body of all cases of misconduct that come to its notice where action by the relevant legal body might be warranted. When the MARA sanctions a registered migration agent, (i.e. caution, suspension, cancellation, or bar) the MARA places the information on the Register of Migration Agents, available on the MARA website, with a link to the decision record.In accordance with section 39B of the Marriage Act, the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants maintains a Register of Marriage Celebrants and all information contained in the Register is available on the Internet. When a marriage celebrant is deregistered, the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants removes the celebrant's name from the Register of Marriage Celebrants. In addition, every month, the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants circulates a list to all State and Territory Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages. This list provides details of all marriage celebrants whose registration has been revoked during that month.I do not, in the ordinary course, raise individual decisions of that type directly with the responsible State or Territory legal disciplinary body. I am advised that the MARA advises the responsible legal disciplinary body of all cases of misconduct that come to its notice where action by the legal disciplinary body might be warranted. When the MARA sanctions a registered migration agent, (i.e. caution, suspension, cancellation, or bar) the MARA places the information on the Register of Migration Agents, available on the MARA website, with a link to the decision record.</DOC>

Investigations on a low and intermediate level waste facility are taking place but no decision has been made. The risks posed to any nuclear facilities would need to be assessed on a site by site basis in the normal course of any approvals process. This was the case for the Lucas Heights replacement reactor.Geoscience Australia made a submission to the Uranium Mining, Processing and Nuclear Energy Review (UMPNER). It stated that 'Australia is the most geologically stable of the continents. It has areas which appear geologically suitable for waste disposal. These are particularly in Precambrian granite-gneiss terranes and clay-rich sedimentary strata, where it is possible to predict the future behaviour of the geological and hydrological systems and provide information on the risks.'UMPNER did not commission any research into, or seek advice on the risks associated with earthquakes. See the response to part 9.Officials are monitoring developments.The safety of nuclear power plants in Japan is a matter for the Japanese Government.The UMPNER report provides details of the cost of nuclear power and information on the management of radioactive waste.

Yes.ALIMTA® (pemetrexed disodium) is the only prescription medicine product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) indicated for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma; and for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, after prior platinum based chemotherapy. This product was registered on 30 June 2004 and the sponsor of Alimta is Eli Lilly Australia Pty Limited.Yes.This is a matter for individual state and territory governments.Medicines are included in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) - an independent, expert advisory body whose members include a range of health professionals and a consumer representative.In considering an application for listing a medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the PBAC must take into account the medical conditions for which the product has been approved for use in Australia, as well as its clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and clinical role compared with other treatments.The PBAC has considered the listing of ALIMTA® (pemetrexed disodium) on the PBS for the treatment of mesothelioma on several occasions. The PBAC rejected these submissions because of unacceptable cost effectiveness. The PBAC acknowledged the severity of the condition and the lack of an effective treatment for mesothelioma. However, at the price proposed in the submissions, even these important factors were insufficient to enable the PBAC to recommend the listing of ALIMTA for this patient group.The company has announced that it has made a new submission for ALIMTA® (pemetrexed disodium) for consideration by the PBAC at its November 2007 meeting. The results from this meeting will be made known six weeks after the meeting.All sponsors of medicines for treatment of patients with mesothelioma are welcome to submit information for consideration by the PBAC at any time.</DOC>

Yes.Yes.Yes. (b) Yes. (c) Yes.Currently there are two Commonwealth documents covering asbestos related issues:- the Occupational Health and Safety (Safety Standards) Regulations  -  Part 6 - Hazardous Substances (the Regulations); and- the Approved Code of Practice on Asbestos.In April 2005, the then National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) now the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) declared a revised National Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos 2nd Edition [NOHSC: 2002 (2005)] and a new National Code of Practice for the Management and Control of Asbestos in Workplaces [NOHSC: 2018 (2005)]. These two national codes of practice propose practical safer methods for managing asbestos hazards to support the Australia-wide ban on new uses of asbestos.In 2005, the Commonwealth Government in association with the then enHealth Council, produced the Management of Asbestos in the Non-Occupational Environment guidelines to inform home owners of the risk of exposure to asbestos products in homes. This guidance has been referred to by individual state and territory jurisdictions which have produced detailed guidance for renovators and home owners on dealing with asbestos-containing products in their homes.Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety regulations require employers falling within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction to ensure that the removal of asbestos from premises is by asbestos removalists operating according to the relevant State or Territory laws. This might require the removalist to obtain a license, permit or some other authorisation by a State or Territory authority to remove asbestos from premises.The transport and disposal of asbestos waste is controlled by the Environment Protection Authority, which stipulates the safe handling and disposal through specific licensing.In September 2006, the Commonwealth Government committed $6.2 million through the National Health and Medical Research Council to establish the National Research Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases and fund eleven research projects for three years.</DOC>

No. It is not possible to determine the impact one initiative, such as the Fuel Consumption Labels, has on the average fuel consumption of the Australian motor vehicle fleet. There are many factors that influence average fuel consumption.The estimates provided to the Government from the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE) indicate that the national average fuel consumption (NAFC) of new passenger cars has decreased since 1999.The Government has been provided estimates of the annual NAFC from the BTRE, shown in the table below. These estimates have been calculated using VFACTS sales data, compiled by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI). It should be noted that the test procedure has changed from AS2877 as prescribed for ADR81/00 and from Jan 04 all new vehicles had to be tested under the new ADR81/01using the UNECE R101 drive cycle.YearNAFC19998.6320008.6220018.6220028.6220038.4720048.4220058.3320068.20As provided in part (a) above, the BTRE estimates are based on data provided by the FCAI. It is assumed that the tests are conducted to all required procedures, and the BTRE is confident the estimates are accurate measures, particularly the trend in the improvement of fuel consumption. However, fuel consumption estimates may be typically lower than actual fuel consumption because the tests cannot account for factors such as individual driving behaviour and traffic congestion.</DOC>

The purpose of ACIS is to provide transitional assistance to encourage competitive investment and innovation in the Australian automotive industry in order to achieve sustainable growth, both in the Australian market and internationally, in the context of trade liberalisation. Registered ACIS participants earn assistance in the form of duty credits from the production of motor vehicles and engines and from investment in approved plant and equipment and research and development in Australia. Duty credits may be used to offset Customs duty on eligible imports, or may be sold or otherwise transferred.The Government does not dictate to ACIS recipients the types of research and development investment that must be undertaken. This gives ACIS recipients maximum flexibility to develop new technologies and products that meet customer demands and international market expectations.The requested figures are not collected under ACIS. See response to Question 1.ACIS participants receive assistance for eligible expenditure. This may be in the areas of improving fuel efficiency, reducing emissions and developing alternative fuel technologies.More specifically, research into fuel efficiency and the uptake of alternative fuels by the motor vehicle manufacturers in Australia is being assisted through the $150 million ACIS Motor Vehicle Producer R&amp;D Scheme, which has provided grants to assist with the development of alternative fuel engine development technologies and hybrid power train development.Outside of ACIS, the Government has recently provided one-off assistance of $52.5 million to Ford Australia, part of which was to assist with the development of a diesel engine Territory/Falcon, while GM Holden was granted $6.7 million to develop fuel economy and emission improvements for the VE Commodore.The requested figures are not collected under ACIS.
