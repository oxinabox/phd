     - I am very kind.
     My question relates to the taxation of payments to groundwater users under the Achieving Sustainable Groundwater Entitlements Program and the integrity of the government's future role in water management.
     Prime Minister, you would recall saying in your answer to my question in this place on 6 September 2006:The New South Wales government thus far have represented to us that they want the payment treated as income because, apparently, they are fearful of a precedent being established whereby such payments are seen as truly they are, and that is as compensation for the withdrawal of a previously conferred water right.
    Prime Minister, freedom of information documents obtained from the New South Wales government relating to this matter clearly indicate that the New South Wales government, through Ministers Knowles and McDonald, were indeed pleading the case of groundwater users in New South Wales not to be taxed under the income tax arrangements for payments received via the joint program.
    Given that the intergovernmental agreement is under the hand of the Australian Government Solicitor and given that the Prime Minister was a co-announcer of the program on 9 June 2005, has the Prime Minister misled the parliament by claiming it was the New South Wales government that wanted the payments to be treated as income, or will he now produce the documents that will support his answer on 6 September and again on 30 October last year?

     It follows on from the Treasurer's claim in his previous answer that the Telstra shares held in the Future Fund are protected from political interference.

     - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
     My question is to the Prime Minister.
     I refer him to the Treasurer's claim that Telstra shares held in the Future Fund are protected from political interference.
     Can the Prime Minister confirm that section 8 of part 3 of schedule 1 of his own Future Fund legislation empowers the government to direct the Future Fund regarding its handling of Telstra shares, including to deal with these shares non-commercially, in contrast to the provisions that apply with respect to the balance of the Future Fund?
     If the government is so concerned to ensure that the Future Fund holding of Telstra shares is protected from political interference, why did you insert this provision in the legislation?
     If Australia's future is not about broadband, what is it about?

     Minister, isn't it a fact that leading labour market economist Mark Wooden, a conservative economist, said:.
    .
    .
     there's not a lot of evidence that individual contracts produce productivity.
    He continued:.
    .
    .
     the biggest gains for productivity still revolve around a system which is collective based.
    Will the minister table the statistical evidence that proves the government's assertion that the government's industrial relations laws have increased productivity?

     Prime Minister, I refer to your answer to my question where you said that it was based on the wrong premise because it failed to take into account the different treatment of Austudy back in the late nineties - which had nothing to do with my question at all.
     Prime Minister, will you in fact answer the question I asked you, which is a future comparison about your government's commitment to education outlays, not the answer that you gave me before which is about the past.

     Does the Prime Minister recall that, in the last 24 hours, his government's backbench has described him as 'the greatest Prime Minister Australia has ever had', the Prime Minister has described the Treasurer as 'the greatest Treasurer Australia has ever had', and the Treasurer has described the government as 'the greatest environmental government that Australia has ever had'?
     Prime Minister, is there any claim to greatness that the government has yet to thrust upon itself?
     And is this why the Prime Minister maintains his claim that Australians have never been better off?

     I refer to the OECD report Education at a glance for 2007.
     Isn't it the case that Australia has the third lowest proportion of public expenditure on education in the OECD, that Australia's proportion of public expenditure on education is 14 per cent below the OECD average and that Australia's proportion of public expenditure on education has declined by nearly six per cent since 1995?
     Why, after 11 years in office, is the government's report card on education 'fail, fail, fail' and what plans will the Prime Minister now outline to the House to deal with his demonstrable failure on education policy?

     I again refer to the OECD report card 2007.
     Prime Minister, isn't it the case that expenditure on early childhood education in Australia is just 0.
    1 per cent of GDP compared to an OECD average of 0.
    5 per cent, placing us equal last for the eighth year in a row?
     Prime Minister, in the absence of an education revolution, isn't the nation at risk of leaving our children with a worse education system from the one the nation inherited?

     Has the Prime Minister now familiarised himself with the Treasurer's comments made on 30 July regarding the housing affordability crisis and about which I asked the Prime Minister on Tuesday:Journalist: Do you concede that there is a housing crisis, affordability crisis in Australia at the moment?
    Treasurer: House prices are higher than they have been and they are higher than they have been because more people are in work and more people are able to afford to borrow to purchase more expensive housing.
    Journalist: So is there a crisis, Treasurer?
    Treasurer: Well, no.
    Does the Prime Minister agree with his Treasurer that there is no housing affordability crisis in Australia?

     Given that the Deputy Prime Minister declared that the funding was a done deal and not an election promise, how does the minister explain comments in today's Financial Review, where his office states in relation to Chaffey Dam:.
    .
    .
     there were hurdles to clear before the commonwealth funding could proceed.
    His office also stated that the project needed to be 'consistent with the principles of the National Water Initiative and the objectives of the National Plan for Water Security'.
     Could the minister explain these inconsistencies between his office's statements and Mr Vaile's announcements?
     Could the minister guarantee to the people of Tamworth that the upgrade will proceed?

     I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian on 27 June 2007 concerning the purchase of Kevin Rudd's and Therese Rein's family home in Brisbane.
     Is the Prime Minister aware that this article states:Liberal Party figures in Queensland, including a forensic accountant, have been examining the purchase, and the links between the vendors and the Labor Party's investment companies, for several months.
    Is this report correct?
     - My question is to the Prime Minister.
     I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian on 27 June 2007 concerning the purchase of Kevin Rudd's and Therese Rein's family home in Brisbane.
     I also refer to the direct quote in that article:Liberal Party figures in Queensland, including a forensic accountant, have been examining the purchase, and the links between the vendors and the Labor Party's investment companies, for several months.
     - I am going to.
     - Can the Prime Minister assure the House that no government members or Liberal Party members were involved in this activity?
