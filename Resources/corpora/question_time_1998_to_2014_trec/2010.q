     - My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
     Could the minister advise the House of any joy on the EC assistance for the flood ravaged gulf, log jammed by the Queensland government now for over year?
     In light of the anniversary of this flooding from Ingham to Burketown, would he not agree that a task force of five Indigenous representatives, three bureaucrats, two greenies, one Sydney suit, a cattle rep and mining rep - neither of whom are pro-irrigation resumptions - and only one lonely farmer is not a task force that is going to, as directed, find sustainable water projects?
     On the contrary, their self-appointed spokesman, the World Wildlife Fund's Stuart Blanch, most arrogantly informed the government that such would not be able to be found because of the north's climate, soils and topography.
     Since most of the United States, China, India and Brazil - half of the world's population - lie within 35 degrees latitude with similar climate, soils and topography, and since Northern Australia's 305 million megalitres rivals the Brahmaputra, Yangtze and Mississippi, would he not agree that the findings are not only absurd but deeply embarrassing?
     And finally -  - Look, these are serious questions.
     If you want to interject, interject intelligently.
     It is a serious question on a very serious matter.
     - Finally, the minister would be aware that the top one-third of Australia has 300 million megalitres of water but negligible farming, whilst the bottom two-thirds, with only 80 million megalitres, has almost all of Australia's food production.
     Since most of Australia's food comes from the crippled Murray-Darling, would the minister not agree bluntly that unless dams and weirs are built in Northern Australia the country will not be the do-nothing, free-trading Mr Tim Fischer's food bowl of Asia but its basket case?
     Would the minister not agree that the task force verdict on Northern Australia - no water - has led to Australia's verdict on the task force: no brains?

     Treasurer, in light of the unresolved energy security debate in this country around an ETS, unresolved home insulation and home solar hot-water plans, rejection last year of a private member's bill for a national gross feed-in tariff scheme, a heavily distorted and currently flailing renewable energy scheme and an unresolved and inconsistent position on the use of uranium for domestic energy use - yet, perversely, the expanding of mines such as Angela Pamela and Olympic Dam for export demand, and added to this we now seem to be leaving sensitive waste management issues at these nine project sites to an overseas entity - how on earth, without so much as a press release, can you reconcile this majority takeover as being in the national interest when we look to be copping all the bad bits about this deal and receiving none of the good bits, such as the use of uranium to cheapen household electricity bills in our energy-security mix in the future?

     These cases were at Hughenden and Richmond with closed down operating theatres, leaving a population of over 3½ thousand nearly 300 kilometres from their nearest medical facility.
    In light of this and the internal Queensland Health papers indicating the economy and 'outcomes efficacy' of closing over 100 Queensland country hospitals - proposals already mooted at Babinda, Atherton and Mareeba - and the downgrading of a dozen other hospitals to, at best, medical aid posts, could the minister assure those outside metropolitan Queensland that the federal government's health plan will not involve any hospital closures or downgrades, and that all existing hospitals and the at present bare-bone service will be maintained at current or improved levels?

     I refer the Prime Minister to various public statements concerning the timing of a resolution to the mining tax issue.
     Last Friday, the Prime Minister said there were weeks and probably months of consultation to go.
     On the same day, the Treasurer said the government would soon move to the third phase of finalising the design.
     Yesterday, Senator Mark Bishop said that it needs to be addressed and resolved urgently.
     This morning, the finance minister said that you cannot put a timeslot on it, while the member for Brand said that the debate should be settled in the next few weeks, and then subsequently said it should be settled by August.
     My question to the Prime Minister is: when will he finally end this amateur hour experimentation with Australia's economic future and dump this bad tax?

     My question to the Prime Minister is: why won't he visit Cloncurry to explain to Mr Kelly that there is no problem really, that he does not have anything to worry about and that, in fact, the great big new tax on mining will be good for jobs and investment - or does he think that Mr Kelly is just part of a scare campaign conspiracy too?

     In light of the Deputy Prime Minister's statement that foreign corporations are paying only 13 per cent tax, is the minister aware that a good example of the counterproductive nature of foreign takeovers and the appallingly failed 'marketism' policies of this place is that the one million people living in North Queensland are now to get their milk from southern Queensland, 2,000 kilometres away, while North Queensland's Malanda Milk, locked out of Woolworths and Coles, must travel 2,000 kilometres south?
     Is the minister further aware that Woolworths and Coles, with 83 per cent of the food market, are paying dutch auction prices to the dairy corporations?
     This oppressive pricing from the chains has seen 240 North Queensland farmers tortured down to just 60.

     I refer to comments by Professor John Mendoza last Friday when announcing his resignation as Chair of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health:_ it is now abundantly clear that there is no vision or commitment from the Rudd Government to mental health _ The Rudd Government is publicly claiming credit for the increased investment in mental health when almost all of this is a consequence of the work of the Howard Government.
    If the Prime Minister cannot be trusted not to take credit for other people's work in mental health, how can he be trusted to be straightforward with the Australian people in any other area?

     I refer the Prime Minister to yet another Indigenous leader who is concerned about the impact of his great big new tax on mining.
     This time it is the former President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Warren Mundine, who said today of the mining tax:I'll be quite honest - it was badly handled upfront _ I have concerns as a Labor Party member that the resource super profits tax is totally absorbing all the energy of the government _Mr Mundine went on:The mining industry is a major player in getting people out of poverty _ It's the highest indigenous employer in the country - they're providing the break to the indigenous people on a major scale.
    We need to ensure that indigenous people are not forgotten.
    That is what Mr Mundine said.
     So I ask the Prime Minister: why won't he forget about modelling based on false assumptions, listen to the concerns of real people and dump this bad tax?

     Prime Minister, the small-business retail and domestic tourism sectors are under pressure right now from a combination of consumer online overseas retailing, international rather than domestic travel and challenges in accessing affordable credit post GFC.
     In the light of these pressures, what is the government doing to aggressively promote 'Buy Australian' and 'Holiday Australian' campaigns in the lead-up to Christmas, a key time for the Australian small-business retail and tourism communities?

     In the gallery today there are three young women who are anxiously awaiting the government's listing of the life-saving drug Soliris.
     One of those young women, Jenny, is forced to have three blood transfusions every month.
     Since the Prime Minister came to office, two young Australians have lost their lives as a result of an insidious disease.
     Given that the government has wasted billions of dollars on the home insulation and school building schemes -  -  - why, 20 months after the PBAC first recommended listing of the drug, does it remain unlisted on the PBS?

    ' Why has the government suddenly decided that struggling families can now afford to pay upwards of $100 per month to access telephone and broadband services under the National Broadband Network, when less than three years ago even the minister said it was 'expensive' and 'something people can't afford to use'?

     I ask whether the Prime Minister stands by her comments in this place on 20 October this year when she stated:I do commit to keeping the promises at a local level that Labor and Labor candidates made at the last election.
    The member for Herbert then left the chamber.

     Given that the government could not deliver on Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch, cannot build GP clinics on schedule, cancelled 220 of the childcare centres it had promised to build, could not safely put pink batts into roofs and wasted billions on overpriced school halls, why would anyone trust this government not to make a complete and utter shambolic mess of the National Broadband Network?

     I refer her to the fact that the original cost of the National Broadband Network was $4.
    7 billion.
     Then it became a $43 billion project written on the back of an envelope.
     In yesterday's summary of the business case, the total investment had increased to nearly $50 billion.
     It has now been asserted today by CEOs of 10 leading telcos, the Alliance for Affordable Broadband, that the true cost is closer to $55 billion.
     Doesn't this further blow-out demonstrate the government is all announcement and no delivery, and cannot be trusted to get anything right?

     Will the Prime Minister confirm that local government planning powers will be overridden so that households will have no right to be consulted on the intrusive and unsightly overhead cables that will be required for the National Broadband Network, and that they will have no right to object?
     Why will the Prime Minister not listen to the concerns of Australian families about the effect of the NBN on their local neighbourhoods?

     In Australia 1,145,000 people live with a profound or serious disability.
     They are likely to be unemployed, marginalised and significantly poorer than the average Australian.
     If the Productivity Commission recommends the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme in its July 2011 report, will the government commit to the implementation of such a scheme during the term of this parliament?

     Will the Prime Minister confirm that her priorities did not include ending the waste, repaying the debt, stopping the big new taxes and, above all, stopping the boats - the measures that the Australian people really want?
     Will she admit that what this proves is that, while Labor might be in government, the Greens are in power?

     I refer the Prime Minister to reports of her crisis caucus meeting last night where 21 Labor backbenchers outlined their concerns that this government has no agenda and, in particular, the Prime Minister is too scripted and, according to the ever-knowledgeable and wise member for Banks, guilty of parroting three-word slogans.
     Does this not simply confirm, Prime Minister, what many Australians now believe, which is that, while Labor is in government, the Greens are in power?

     I refer the Prime Minister to reports from water authorities that electricity costs are driving up water costs.
     The number of customers seeking assistance has grown by 20 per cent in the last couple of years.
     If the government cannot ease the cost-of-living pressures on struggling Australian families how can anybody expect you to get right the delivery of a $50 billion national broadband network?

     I refer to the fact that since Labor was elected in November 2007 they have committed more than $350 million to open more than 6,000 new beds in our immigration detention network - far more new detention beds than beds opened in public hospitals.
     If the government cannot protect our borders, how can anybody be expected to believe that it can get it right in the delivery of the $50 billion NBN?
