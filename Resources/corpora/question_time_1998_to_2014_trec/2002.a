 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member knows, Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence, issued a statement last night, and in that statement and in comments I and others have made we have pointed out that it is a longstanding practice, not just of this government but of successive Australian governments, not to comment on matters of intelligence and security.Opposition members - Oh! - As I said, it is a longstanding practice, and when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister it was a practice that was observed by his government as well. However, Senator Hill did point out that in this particular case it was important to reassure the Australian public that the allegations in the media, the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition, lack substance. In particular, neither the communications of the MUA, nor of the ITF, were the subject of DSD targeting or reporting. Much has been made of the fact, and the minister in his statement too has made it clear, that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Blick, produces an annual report every year and constantly monitors DSD's operations to ensure that they comply with the appropriate guidelines on the privacy of Australians and, if there is any breach of that privacy, that breach is referred to in the report to the parliament of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Senator Hill made it clear yesterday that around the period being referred to in the Daily Telegraph article there was an inadvertent error made - Opposition members - Oh! - There was indeed an inadvertent error made by DSD, and this had been referred back to the Inspector-General by Senator Hill, and the Inspector-General has had another look at this matter. These intelligence matters are matters that obviously need to be protected in the national interest but, because of the Leader of the Opposition's interest in this issue, the government would be happy, privately, to brief the Leader of the Opposition about that inadvertent error. I think when the Leader of the Opposition finds out what the inadvertent error is he will realise that this is an insubstantial error and he will realise that the kind of fear campaign that he has been developing about DSD and its role, based on rather a long period in opposition and out of government, I suspect, is little short of irresponsible. Trying to whip up feeling like that, if I may say so, against the fundamental intelligence agency of this country is irresponsible. It served Labor governments as an organisation extremely well, as the former Leader of the Opposition knows only too well. It served your governments extremely well, and it serves us well. It is not an organisation which is a tool of politics or political power. - Mr Speaker, I have answered the question. I have said that you can have a private briefing on an inadvertent error, and you will find out from that private briefing that you are embarrassing yourself going down this path.  - In conclusion, let me say that this is a government that does use its intelligence agencies to support our national interests and protect our borders, and on that point we make no apology. We are a government which will not wind back the operation of our intelligence agencies in so far as they support our national interests in protecting our borders and our security, and it will not be missed by many Australians that the Labor Party wishes to undermine the credibility of the DSD.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his maiden question. I think he will have many more opportunities to ask questions in this House. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, can I congratulate the honourable member for Dickson and other honourable members on both sides of the House for the very good maiden speeches that they have made.May I remind the House that on 9 November, which was the day before the election, I indicated that I would commission a report on the sequence of events involving the advice given to ministers on or about 7 October that some children had been thrown overboard the vessel known in the defence report as SIEV4. After the election, on 13 November, I formally requested the preparation of that report, which I am going to table, from the secretary of my department.It is clear from the report, which I will table during question time, that the original statements made by ministers regarding children being thrown overboard were based on reports and advice received. They were provided in good faith to ministers by serving officers of the defence forces and were used in good faith by ministers. It is also clear from the report that subsequently doubts about the veracity of the original advice to ministers arose within the defence establishment, but the report contains differing recollections regarding the communication of those doubts to the former defence minister.The report clearly states that neither me nor the minister for immigration were informed by our departments or other officials that the original advice may have been inaccurate. I table the report prepared by Jennifer Bryant, Assistant Secretary, Education and Immigration Branch of the Social Policy Division, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, dated 21 January 2001. There was a companion report prepared by Defence under the inquiry procedures of the Defence Act. It contains a number of coloured pages which are not as easy to reproduce as this document and it may be an hour or two before that document is available because of the need to reproduce the coloured pages. As soon as it is, it will be tabled and also made available.</DOC>

 - I have no knowledge or recollection of any such request having been made. I have not specifically spoken to the former defence minister about it. Can I simply say again that at all stages it is my advice that the law was adhered to and that there was nothing done in relation to Australian citizens that was not properly within the law and properly within the usages and customs of the intelligence service. There has been some reference made - the Leader of the Opposition has dwelt upon this in comment outside this place - to an inadvertent intercept. Could I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he cared to have a look at the web site of the Defence Signals Directorate and at the annual reports of that particular organisation going back, for example, to 1993-94, he will find that, given the amount of work involved for DSD, from time to time there are breaches, inadvertent intercepts.To suggest that it is some kind of security outrage that there was one inadvertent breach in relation to this material, can I remind him, for example, that in 1993-94 the annual report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security discloses that during the previous year there were 28 breaches. I offer no criticism of that. There were 28 breaches in the previous year and they all occurred when the Defence Signals Directorate was under the surveillance of and answerable to the former government. It stands to reason, if you just pause for a moment, given the nature of intelligence activities, that from time to time there will be inadvertent breaches. I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition to take advantage of the offer made - which I endorse - by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Leader of the Opposition be confidentially briefed about the nature of that. Any suggestion that at a political level the government sought to use the intelligence organisation to further its political agenda in relation to matters, I completely deny.  Let me make it very plain to the House that the issues at stake in relation to the action the government took regarding MV Tampa were very clear. We did not need the counsel and advice of the intelligence services to indicate what was in the Australian national interest in relation to that issue. We knew what the national interest of Australia required. The national interest of Australia required that the government take the action it did.The operation of the intelligence services were, on my advice, wholly consonant with the law, save and except the inadvertent breach to which Senator Hill has referred. There was no targeting of the unions, and any attempt to whip up some argument about us targeting the unions is rejected. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you continue to make reference to inadvertent breaches, I ask you to remember the contents of all these annual reports and the number of breaches previously reported. The Australian intelligence services deserve support, understanding and a defence by this government. They serve the national interest, and it is in the interests of all of us that their strengths be supported and maintained.I want to also make it plain that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Blick, who indicated yesterday that he was reviewing all of the material in relation to this matter, indicated to the defence minister this morning that he will carry out an inquiry. I welcome that. This government has nothing whatever to hide in relation to this issue. There may be a little bit of first day excitement on the other side about it. I can assure those who sit opposite and, more importantly, the Australian public that we have not used the intelligence services of this country for political purposes. We use the intelligence services to defend the national interest. We make no apology for that. We will do it in the future. That is our duty and that is our obligation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his maiden question - perhaps the most penetrating question from a member for Dobell in over a decade. It is a fine contribution to this House, and something which I am sure will continue. In relation to unauthorised boat arrivals, last year's budget allowed $250 million for unauthorised boat arrivals, $190 million of which was for the department of immigration. At the time of the mid-year review and in the pre-election statement, another $147 million for this financial year was allowed - capital and operating costs of $130 million to the department of immigration and the remainder principally in relation to costs involving Nauru. The additional estimates, which will be presented tomorrow, will include another $85 million which will cover approximately $18½ million in relation to Manus Island and the remainder will be in relation to capital and operational costs to the department of immigration. It is quite possible that there will be savings made on those costs in this financial year if the number of unauthorised arrivals remains, as it currently does, at very low levels. In August of last year, the number of unauthorised arrivals who came to Australia in that month alone was 1,200. If that rate, or anything like that rate, had continued, the costs of managing those unauthorised boat arrivals would have blown out to something like $400 million for immigration alone. This government has put in place a number of measures to protect Australia's borders and there is evidence that they are being successful. There have been no unauthorised boat arrivals in the last two months. -  - The meteorologists on the other side claim it is all an act of God. As previous years show, there have been arrivals in December and January in previous years. Let me figure it out - maybe monsoons only started this Christmas, did they? Maybe this was some kind of new development. One does not want to prejudge what the smugglers might do, because the smugglers obviously are looking for new ways of smuggling people into Australia and, this being the profitable trade that it is, one cannot say that success has been gained. I can say that the fact that the government put in place these measures has dramatically reduced the number of arrivals. We believe that there could be savings if that continues. We also note that the Labor Party, or at least a proportion of it, supports our proposals and our policies - which proportion of it, we cannot tell, but there is a proportion of it that supports them.  -  - Whilst many are interjecting, there are others who are saying publicly that they actually support our measures. I make this point: the government has determined that it will be putting in place those measures which will protect Australia's borders. There is evidence that that has been successful and that the costs have been contained against what they would have been otherwise. I make this point in conclusion: notwithstanding costs, we on this side of the House believe it is a government's duty to protect the country's borders, and we will be putting in place the measures which are required to do that. We believe it is one of the prime responsibilities for any government to protect its borders and to look after the national security. If the Labor Party can support us in doing that, so much the better, but this government will lead on this issue and it will deliver.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to be given the opportunity to set the record straight. What was just said was a misleading piece of information. The government is seeking to establish a regime to protect the national security across the board. It is very important that we see this as being a matter in the public interest, and I hope it will receive bipartisan support.The article to which the member for Barton refers relates to the espionage bill that is contemplated for introduction. The espionage bill is a piece of legislation that was developed in the last parliament and introduced. It was designed to bring the espionage offence up to date to take account of recent events and, in particular, to deal with a situation that arose in 1999 in relation to Jean-Philippe Wispelaere which demonstrated that there was a need to modernise the offence.Included in that bill was a provision designed to restate a provision in the Crimes Act relating to official information and to transfer it, in more modern and appropriate language, to the Criminal Code. Media reports have suggested that the purpose of this aspect of the legislation is to plug leaks, to stop whistleblowers and to curb the freedom of the press. Nothing could be further from the truth. That provision in that bill did not seek to change the law in any way; it simply sought to change the form in which it was expressed. I am encouraged by a recent article in the Canberra Times that correctly reports that the bill will not create any new official secrets offences.As I said when I first introduced the bill in September last year, the bill is primarily designed to strengthen Australia's espionage laws. The espionage offences will be significantly different but the provisions relating to official information will not be. I look forward to the Labor Party supporting the bill when it is reintroduced. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I can inform him that today's Westpac-Melbourne Institute index showed that consumer sentiment rose for the fourth consecutive month and is now about 13 per cent above its long-term average and is certainly above its pre September 11 levels. It is great news to see that consumers have recovered confidence, which fell in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. Yesterday's National Australia Bank business survey showed that business confidence was rising. It, too, had recovered and was now higher than at any time since the September 11 terrorist attacks.Rising consumer confidence and rising business confidence are good in a very uncertain world. We know that the United States economy was in recession at the end of last year. Japan is in its third recession in a decade. Singapore is in a deep recession. Taiwan is in a deep recession. Growth in Europe is sluggish. Yet the Australian economy throughout the course of 2001 probably grew not only more than any of the other developed countries but substantially more. No other country in the developed world has a growth rate anywhere near three per cent or above, and the highest outside Australia was around two per cent. Australia grew at about double the rate of the next highest growth in the developed world, and at about five times the average rate of the G7.I am sure all Australians will be pleased to welcome the news that the Australian economy continued to grow through the course of 2001. It was of course partly a response to many of the reforms which the government put in place over recent years. It would not have happened if we had not taken taxes off our exports - wasn't that a great reform, which was put in place on behalf of Australia's exporters. Australia's farmers got reductions in diesel costs and in the taxes on exports and were able to hold up Australia's exports while the world went into recession. Wasn't it good to have income tax cuts coming on-stream during the course of 2001, because that also kept up spending. The interest rate reductions throughout the course of 2001 were also supportive, as was the First Home Owners Scheme. I know that many in the coalition party supported the First Home Owners Scheme to help young Australian couples to get homes. It has been good for young Australians.We notice that the Australian Labor Party is now discovering the `aspirational voter', something that was discovered by Robert Menzies nearly 50 years ago. He called them the `forgotten people', people who were not part of big business or big unions but wanted to have a home and a family and wanted to better themselves in life, as was pointed out in a maiden speech prior to question time. We welcome the interest of the parliament, on both sides now, in the `forgotten people', those people who really want to save and get a home - and the First Home Owners Scheme was very much a part of that.The state of the international economy remains very severe. Nobody should kid themselves that we are going to go back, in international terms, to anything like the conditions that were experienced during the 1990s, but this government remains focused on keeping the Australian economy growing, to look after as best it can - by promoting further labour market reforms and economic reforms - those people who are very much the focus of government policy, those people who are very much on the minds, and retain the continuing interest, of the coalition government.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I do not have the exact words with me, but my recollection from looking at the document over the last couple of days is that the general tenor of the comments the honourable member made in his question is right, and this of course is the whole point. There were guidelines - they have been updated since the Intelligence Services Bill went through the parliament into the Intelligence Services Act, a piece of legislation introduced by this government to give the public still greater confidence in our intelligence agencies and, what is more, to set up a parliamentary committee with the role - albeit a limited role - of oversight over DSD as well as ASIS. It is very important that there is public confidence in these agencies and that there is transparency.There are privacy provisions - there are now and there were back then, last year in the period the honourable member refers to, and of course way before that, back into the period of the Labor government. Off the top of my head - I could be wrong - I do not think those privacy provisions were changed by this government after 1996. I think the same or very nearly the same privacy provisions applied under the previous government. Absolutely, it is not the role of DSD to collect conversations between Australians, except in circumstances of dire national emergency or where there is a very direct threat to national security. We have made the point here, and it is an important point, that the DSD say that in this particular instance -  and by `this particular instance' I mean during the period of time which the Daily Telegraph article referred to - there was an inadvertent error.One does not want to just leave the point of the inadvertent error hanging there so people run away and think that this is a conversation between Paul Kelly of the Australian and the captain of the Tampa or something like that, or between a Labor member such as the member for Fremantle or whoever it may have been and the captain of the Tampa. By the way, whether she rang the captain of the Tampa or not, I do not know; I would not be surprised if she had, though.The point of the inadvertent error, though, is that that is an error in relation to the guidelines the honourable member referred to. That is the point of `inadvertent error'. We will brief the Leader of the Opposition on what the inadvertent error is, so you can see that all this wild talk of spying on Australian politicians, on Australians and so on is, believe me, way over the top.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I wish to assure him that the government's third term agenda certainly does include boosting small business and helping small business to create more jobs. Let me say that the best thing that this government, this parliament and this polity can do to help create more jobs in Australia is to take the unfair dismissal burden off small business. After economic conditions generally and some tax matters, small business consistently says that the biggest single obstacle to hiring more staff is the unfair dismissal burden. Do not just believe me on this, Mr Speaker; let me quote the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for resources, who said: Well my wife consistently tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation. All those perceptions are out there, all of them are well founded ...The member for Hunter is absolutely right. It is about time the unfair dismissal burden was taken off the back of small business. If just one in 20 small businesses were to put on an extra staff member as a result of changes the government might make, there would be more than 50,000 new jobs in Australia -  50,000 more jobs that Australian workers and would-be workers need.On this issue we can focus on one or two hard cases, and on that basis we can build a whole regulatory burden that impacts on hundreds of thousands of good businesses like the business of the member for Hunter's wife as well as a few bad businesses or we can restate our faith in the decency of Australian small business and the commonsense of Australian workers to sort these things out for themselves. This government will never make quasi-Marxist assumptions that all employers are exploiters and that all workers are victims. This government will always try to promote a greater spirit of partnership in the Australian workplace.The Leader of the Opposition in a different context said yesterday that he had turned over a new leaf. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to turn over a new leaf in another context - a context vital to the welfare of Australian small business and to the creation of jobs in this country. I invite him to rise above his past as a union official to prove that the Labor Party really can change and to support the government's fair dismissal bill.</DOC>

 - I say to the honourable member for Ballarat that I do remember making a statement substantially to that effect, and it remains the intention of the government to legislate in this area. The reference in the Governor-General's speech was a reference to the consultation that we are undertaking with the business community, particularly with small business, so that when the legislation is brought in proper regard is paid to the impact of those changes on small business. I am quite resolved, and the government is quite resolved, that we will make this change. Without checking my files, but from recollection, if this measure had applied over the last period of years, something like 87 to 90 per cent of entitlements would have been paid to people who lost their entitlements as a result of companies going bankrupt or going into liquidation or receivership in circumstances where they could not meet their full workers' entitlements.This is an important and serious issue. It has been underlined by a number of company failures in recent years. I remind the honourable member that for a couple of years we operated a safety net scheme, to which no state government opted to contribute other than the South Australian government. We have now indicated that as a result of the failure of state governments to come to the party we are prepared to go further in order to cover these entitlements. I can assure the honourable member that we will be legislating. We are consulting - as the Governor-General's speech alluded to - with small business to ensure there are no deleterious impacts, but it is our intention to legislate. </DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Congratulations, firstly, on your re-election to the esteemed position of Speaker. Congratulations also to the member for Cowper on not only his election to the parliament to follow in the fine footsteps of his predecessor but also a great maiden speech this morning. The Howard government is completely committed to seeing that the 21st century for Australia is built very much on a research and information culture. To that end last year the government committed $2.9 billion to the Backing Australia's Ability program, which comprises a series of measures which support research, research infrastructure, incentives for industry in business and the commercialisation of ideas. Included in that is a doubling of the budget for the Australian Research Council over the next five years, a further $736 million.Two weeks ago I announced that one-third of that ARC budget - as I said, which will be doubled over the next five years - will be committed fully to four research priorities. They will be nano- and biomaterials, genome and phenome research, complex and intelligent systems and photon science and technology. The priority research areas have been adopted by the government after an exhaustive process, which involved 60 eminent scientists, the Chief Scientist and the board of the Australian Research Council - a process which lasted some four to six months. Finally, the expert committee recommended to the government that four research priorities be funded.Some of the criticism that has come to the government from members of the opposition suggested that in some way this was inappropriate. In fact, the recently retired Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra said in the Australian newspaper on 6 February this year:It is quite sensible to propose that at a given moment some areas of research, all things considered, are more important and more deserving of money than others.He went on further to say:... not to engage in this kind of priority setting seems silly in a country of fewer than 20 million people.The member for Cowper asks me about other policies. There are other policies, and in one sense there are not other policies. The Labor spokespeople have started the year where we left them. I think the Treasurer would remember this: the member for Dawson very kindly pointed out to us last year that the Labor Party are like a cattle dog in the back of a truck. They run from one side of the truck to the other, depending on the slightest attraction which seems to take their attention. Labor's shadow spokesperson has criticised me on behalf of the government for picking priorities. The shadow spokesperson for Labor has said:The Government's `picking winners' approach to research contradicts the stated objectives of the Australian Research Council.That is from a media release on 29 January. Firstly, one of the ARC's priorities - in fact, one of its charter objectives - is to:·	contribute to the development of a coordinated approach to setting priorities in research ...It makes you wonder how the Labor Party can attack the government for setting research priorities, when there is only one policy document on their web site when you visit it, and it is Knowledge Nation. If you go to page 37 of the hard copy, Knowledge Nation says:Government should be in the business of determining priority industries ...Wait for this - it says:... fear of `picking winners' should not be allowed to constrain Australia from developing a national investment strategy. On this side we have no trouble picking winners: we seem to have chosen one in our Prime Minister. But the Labor Party obviously has problems with these four priorities. I challenge the Australian Labor Party to nominate which of those four priorities it would not fund, particularly when you consider that Knowledge Nation said the following ought to be priorities:·	the development of industries in emerging fields such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, information and communications technology, and environmental management - Apart from anything else, environmental issues and dryland salinity and a whole range of other things important to the member for Cowper and many people on this side will be funded under the research that will be covered in these four priorities.</DOC>

 - I take the opportunity to congratulate the member for Jagajaga on her elevation to deputy leadership of the opposition. A point that needs to be made first in relation to higher education - and I am very pleased that I have been asked a question about unmet demand and the number of places in Australian universities - is that there are a number of issues that need to be pointed out. The first is that there are now 55,000 more equivalent full-time student unit places in higher education than there were when this government came to office in 1996. Some 25,000 of those are fully funded undergraduate places. The sector this year will have $10.4 billion dollars available to it in terms of revenue; $6.15 billion of that will come from the Commonwealth government, $1.98 billion more than it had when your government left office. And, most importantly in terms of unmet demand, in 1992 when there were 1.1 million Australians in this country without work, do you know how many people could not get a place in university? Twice as many as there are today. One hundred thousand people could not get a place in higher education in this country.The other thing that needs to be made clear is that the opposition has a choice. The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have a choice. You can spend this year doing what you have done for the past six years. You can oppose every single measure that is brought into the parliament by this government to increase wealth creation and you can do everything you can to oppose every measure that is proposed by this government, or you can support me and support this government in addressing the real issues that face Australian higher education. I have foreshadowed that much of this year will be spent in the process of policy review in relation to higher education and universities. We have to make sure that regional universities are on a sound footing. We have to have a system which means that work practices in universities are not much different from the rest of working Australia. We also have to ensure that the universities in large cities are able to see that they can compete with the rest of the world. What that means is reviewing all of the issues that affect universities, including governance and administration. If you want to come in here every day for the next year and criticise anything and everything that we do, then you consign yourselves to another term in opposition. I would also say to the newly elected member for Burke - and I listened with interest to his first speech - that in 1995, 15 per cent of students in Australian universities came from the bottom 25 per cent of income earning families. Three years after the election of this government it had increased to 19 per cent. There are 10,700 more students in universities today from low socioeconomic backgrounds than there were when we came to office. This government is about ensuring that higher education and information, research and innovation are the foundation for the future of this country, and you ought to help us put together meaningful policies to expand them further. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. We welcome the comments by ACOSS and their interest in the unemployed of this country. It is timely at this, the start of 2002, to outline not only what the government has achieved since the introduction of the Job Network and its expansion into regional and rural Australia from 300 old CESs to some 2000 outlets which are connecting Australians with people who are out there to try to get them work, but also some of the important initiatives that we are about to undertake and that are going to impact on the lives of both employers and employees.Last year the government announced as part of its Australians Working Together initiative that we would be committing $1.7 billion over the next four years to further improve the opportunities available for Australia's unemployed. To that end, we have $324 million being provided for 30,000 places in extra Job Search Training, with intensive assistance being given to people on how to get a job; we have 16,500 places in the Work for the Dole program, which is proving very successful right around Australia; we have $251 million being provided to help parents who want to re-enter the work force after they have been carers; we also have 3,600 new extra literacy and numeracy training places at a cost of $9 million.Today, unemployed people looking for an opportunity that perhaps is eluding them know that they can commence a Work for the Dole program with real work opportunities and that this government is going to reward them by ensuring that they receive a training credit of up to $800 towards real training at the end of that time. Once they have built their own commitment, their own self-esteem, and are back in the community getting work experience we can give them the extra assistance that they may need, with the $800 training credit to get them back in the real work force. So when ACOSS calls for additional funding in the area of employment services, I am pleased to say that this government is delivering now and will be delivering into the future.In the important area of indigenous employment we are taking an extra step from the old CDEP program and involving indigenous employment centres. Aboriginals, who are the most disadvantaged in our community, are working in their own communities and being fully engaged in employment again and being productive members of our society. We hope to be in a position this month to announce the first of those pilot programs. These sorts of practical measures are ensuring that, whilst the world economy is turning down, the Job Network and the government's employment services continue to provide for Australia's unemployed. There is much more to be done and we will continue to work with organisations like ACOSS and the myriad of other fine organisations providing Job Network services around Australia to deliver to both Australia's business community and the unemployed.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the report does contain a reference, from recollection -  I would have to read it again; it is a couple of weeks since I have read the report - substantially to the effect of the first part of the Leader of the Opposition's question. It also contains - this was not acknowledged in the Leader of the Opposition's question - reference to a number of statements attributed to the former defence minister's then staff putting a slightly different version and that is why in the comment I made when I tabled the document I said that there were conflicting reports regarding the communication to the minister. The report has been tabled and I would invite all honourable members and the media to read it. In relation to the last part of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I can certainly indicate to him that, as the reports will indicate, steps were taken at my insistence to make the video available. As far as I am concerned there was no attempt on my part or, to my knowledge, by anybody else to suppress any information.</DOC>

 - I am really pleased to have the member for Dunkley ask my maiden question in this place. I am especially pleased to be part of a government that has appointed the first ever Commonwealth minister for citizenship in 101 years. The member for Dunkley has shown, as all members on this side demonstrate in their conduct in public life, a commitment to the strengths that individuals from a variety of cultures bring to the equation for building a better and stronger community here in Australia. This government has put in place measures to ensure that Australia remains a tolerant, harmonious community and one that respects difference and encourages individuals from a diverse background to contribute to our nation.It is important to know that there are those in our community who, sadly, want to promote the negatives and to cause difficulties; they see one problem and try to say that that is the whole. On this side, we believe strongly that the positives our diverse community have brought to this nation need to be promoted, and we will deal with the problems one at a time. It is stunning to know that those opposite went into the last election without one mention of citizenship and multiculturalism. There was no guarantee of funding to the various government initiatives that we have put in place - the Living in Harmony grants, Citizenship Day. Those matters did not rate a mention in Labor Party policy prior to the last election. Multicultural Australia certainly did see through the Australian Labor Party on 10 November last year. The steps that the member for Dunkley seeks that will help the Australian community maintain its harmony following September last year include the wise appointment of a Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs by our Prime Minister and also the provision of new Living in Harmony grants and a partnership program, which are providing funding to address issues arising out of 11 September last year, using schools especially. After all, when younger Australians from diverse backgrounds get together in schools, it is important that they understand a respecting of the differences and have an energy to learn from those differences and to apply that in a positive way. So antiracism initiatives in schools are maintained, and settlement programs, something the Labor Party also did not commit themselves to prior to last year's election, are also continuing. I believe there is tremendous harmony in Australia's community despite all of the pressures that some opposite and some of their fellow travellers around Australia continue to try to put onto the Australian community. There is tremendous harmony in Australia. Last year -  -  - and those opposite would be wise to just settle down because it is important to note this -  - when the mosque in Kuraby in my electorate was firebombed a few days after September 11, the local community got together and went and expressed support - and, in fact, a great strength of feeling - to the people who attended that mosque. I have found that the imam at that mosque, Yusuf Peer, offered, in fact, great support to his community and rightly said it was just one individual within the community that did something wrong, not the Australian community as a whole.So it is obvious that, under the leadership of this Prime Minister and this government, the appointment of a minister to look particularly after citizenship issues highlights the fact that the diverse communities that we have and the strength that we have through that diversity are, of course, brought together by citizenship, a common bond. It is important for all members in this House to talk it up, not to talk it down, and I have distributed to all members some information about Harmony Day on 21 March, one of the commitments that we have but Labor did not have prior to the last election. I would urge all members to use their office to promote good harmony in our community, because it is good for all Australians, particularly those more recently arrived migrants.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that the assumption on which his question is based is wrong. It is plainly wrong, and I stand by the previous answer. The report indicates very clearly that the claims made by me and by the minister for immigration and the Minister for Defence on or about 7 and 8 October were based on clear advice communicated to us from Defence. Not only was there a reference made in an ONA report but there was in fact a written -  - In addition there was a written communication in a task force report which was conveyed to me, and that was the basis. And the information that was provided to the minister for immigration was, I understand, provided to him by the secretary of his department, Mr Farmer, who was a member of the task force. - The point I am making to the Leader of the Opposition is that the report makes it clear that at no stage were the minister - that is, the minister for immigration - or I told by our departments or by other officials -   - Oh, it's not true? - No. The Leader of the Opposition asked me when did I know. The answer is that my belief was based upon the original advice that I received and that other ministers received on or about 7 October. That remained my belief until I received this report in relation to the children overboard.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and may I extend my congratulations to you on your appointment. - Immediately upon my appointment as minister for regional services, I made public announcements attacking the scandalous differential that exists between city and country retail fuel prices. I also proposed a solution which was to achieve by negotiation or legislation an open, consistent and transparent terminal gate price system, so as to allow resellers, larger country consumers such as farmers, and motorists either direct access to the best wholesale price or the knowledge of the profit margin charged by local outlets.I have also made it clear that a typical road freight tanker freight rate for fuel is ½c per litre per 100 kilometres, meaning that for the majority of country resellers their freight cost is only equal to the Howard government one to three cent per litre country reseller subsidy. My office has already had discussions with major fuel companies and I am delighted to advise the House that the Shell company has announced today that it is to implement the process I have recommended in all states bar Western Australia where it is prevented from so doing by WA Labor government legislation. Shell has already announced a range of prices, which it will adjust twice weekly.The member for Lingiari has constantly regaled this House with the cost of fuel at Yuendumu, approximately 1,200 kilometres south-west of Darwin. Under these new arrangements, and after allowing a fair margin, the price of unleaded fuel at that locality can drop from its present $1.40 per litre to $1 per litre. Prices in Bourke, Gympie and Mildura could fall approximately 5c per litre after allowing a 7c per litre retail margin, which compares favourably with the 2c per litre typical for larger outlets. These savings can only be delivered if retailers take advantage of the direct access I have negotiated. I trust local members will involve themselves in ensuring that their constituents receive the benefits of this government initiative and the responsiveness of the Shell company, whom I congratulate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lalor for her first question. In this parliament I may get more questions than I have had in the past. Early in October a suspected illegal entry vessel with 229 people on board was intercepted off Christmas Island. On 7 October at 9.45 a.m. I was explaining the implications of the border protection legislation bills that this House has passed and I had a call from the secretary to my department, Mr Farmer, who was taking part in a meeting of the high level interdepartmental working group considering this issue. Mr Farmer advised me that the working group had received advice from a representative of the Department of Defence that all passengers on the vessel were wearing life jackets, that some were jumping into the water -   - and that some were throwing their children overboard. My recollection is that the vessel sank several days later. I did advise the media attending the press conference of the information I had received. I later became aware of some reports from Christmas Island that were carried in newspapers. I know of those reports only what was contained in them. I do not know whether they had any veracity associated with them or not. The fact is that at no time have I been advised that the initial advice that was given to me was -  - I simply say: at no time was I advised that the information that was given to me was otherwise than correct. The fact is that that was the case. I have not seen the report, which you are all reading, that has been tabled today. -  - That is the case. The Prime Minister has tabled the report today. I will read it and come to a view as to whether or not I should form a different view as to what may or may not have happened at that time.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I initially congratulate you on your election to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives again. - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Australia exports about $1 billion worth of steel products and some $450 million worth of that goes predominantly into the west coast mills of the United States. Members would be aware that the US government has conducted an inquiry, subject to a safeguards action, on the imports generically of steel into the United States and our exports to the United States have formed part of that inquiry. The administration is currently reviewing the recommendations of the ITC on that, which recommended tariffs of 20 to 40 per cent. I had the opportunity during a recent visit to Detroit, Washington and New York to press the case of the Australian steel industry in terms of the competitive nature of the product that we export and sell to the United States.A number of members in the House who represent electorates that produce and export steel - the member for Throsby, the member for Cunningham, the collective members who represent the Hunter Valley and Newcastle area - would also be aware of the sometimes painful but nevertheless important reform process that Australia's steel industry has undertaken in recent years. So the case that we are pressing with the United States is that what we export to the United States is not subsidised, is efficiently produced and is produced far more efficiently than other steel mills do in other parts of the world, particularly in the United States.We got a very good hearing from senior members of the administration, and BHP and other Australian steel exporters have made some suggestions as to how the Australian product may be dealt with in the administration's response to this. We certainly got a very good hearing, and they are seriously considering the suggestions that we made and that BHP made when they visited the United States the week before I was there. The important point to make - and it is one that often causes some concern in the Australian community - is that, when Australian industries are going through a reform process, whether they be manufacturing industries or agricultural industries, we are now in a position where we are driving the economy along and we are more efficient and more competitive in most sectors on the international scene and we do not deserve to be prejudiced in such a way that we get lumped in with the other steel producing countries of the world in an action like this. We will continue to argue the case on behalf of Australia's steel exporters in this particular circumstance and in others if they arise. We believe that we had a good hearing. Our suggestions are being seriously considered. We look forward to the response of the administration, which we understand is due in the first fortnight of March - that is the time frame that has been allowed. Our officials in Washington continue to work actively with our like-minded counterparts, particularly the US steel industry from the West Coast and some of the unions, I might add, that work in that steel industry that use the Australian feed stock that goes into supporting those jobs there.A final point that is very important is that we actually deliver steel to the steel mills on the west coast of the US at $US40 a tonne cheaper than it can be delivered from the east coast mills. We made that very salient point. I know the Prime Minister made that point as well in his meetings when he was visiting the United States. We should give credit to the Australian steel industry and to those who work in it that we can be so efficient and so competitive. That point should not be lost in this case and we have made it very strongly.</DOC>

 - I assume that the Leader of the Opposition's question refers to the issue of the photographs? - That being the case, I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the report, on which his question and the question of the member for La Trobe was based, after having quoted the finding that Mr Reith and a number of his senior advisers had been informed that the photographs released the previous day did not depict children in the water after having been thrown overboard on 7 October, then goes on to say that evidence from Mr Reith and his staff indicates that they did not consider that they had received clear advice that the photographs had been misrepresented. -  - It is typical: one part of the report is read out but the other part -  - If the Minister for Defence did not believe prior to the date mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition that he had received clear advice that the photographs had been misrepresented, it stands to reason that he would not have communicated to me or to anybody else a clear view that they had been misrepresented. The House will know that there was media debate about the photographs before the election. In fact, the day before the election on 9 November I and a number of other people were questioned about it. It arose out of the statements that were made by Vice Admiral Shackleton regarding what the video represented, and he made the statement that the video did not depict children being thrown overboard. That bore upon what the video depicted; it did not bear upon the veracity of the advice that was given to us about children having been thrown overboard. Nothing can alter the fact that we were informed that children had been thrown overboard. It was on the basis of that that the statements were made. There was subsequently doubt formed within the Defence hierarchy. - There has been conflicting evidence given to the inquiry about the communication of those doubts. I invite members to read not only the report that I tabled -  - but also the other report carried out by Major General Powell, dated 14 December 2001, that I referred to and which I now table.  - The government has commissioned these two inquiries. They show very clearly that the original statements made by me, by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and by the Minister for Defence were based on advice given in good faith and that advice was used in good faith. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say can alter that situation. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I do remember that interview, and I do remember giving that assurance. Shortly after that press conference I spoke to the then defence minister and asked him whether there was any further evidence that could be made available. He indicated to me - as was within my knowledge because of some press reports - that there were some photographs. I suggested that, if it was operationally possible, those be made available if they provided further evidence. My recollection of the conversation - there may have been two in a short period of time - is that it was agreed that those photographs would be made available. He subsequently made some comments about it. I have checked my transcripts for that period and, as the deputy leader will know, it was a very busy political period. Interestingly enough, I do not appear to have been asked another question on that issue for another 16 days.</DOC>

 - I thank my electoral neighbour and good friend the new member for Parkes for his maiden question, following closely on an outstanding maiden speech. It is good to have him here, and I know of his very great interest in transport reform, because it is very important indeed to the national economy, and in particular to rural and regional Australia, because of the need for efficient export transport services. It is very good news. This reform, in essence, provides an environment whereby rail may be able to compete far more effectively with road, because in many ways it is putting it on a similar footing. We have not, as some commentators have suggested or wondered aloud about, privatised the railways themselves. The track remains in public ownership and management structures, but above-track operations will increasingly now be conducted - in a pattern similar to road - by the private sector, bringing all of their expertise, their capital and their competitive spirit to bear on making this neglected transport sector in Australia really start to compete and really start to attract freight. I think that that is what will happen. The total value of this deal was some $1.172 billion. National Rail Corporation and FreightCorp were sold to the national rail consortium made up of Toll Holdings and Lang Corporation. As Terry McCrann in the Herald Sun commented, it is `a brilliant marriage of old and new'. It allows the company to offer a much wider range of transport services and solutions. In essence, done properly, it will mean more freight on rail and less on our roads, and - I think of very great importance - offers the chance to ensure that transport does not become a bottleneck in the economy, given that the latest estimates show that the total freight task in Australia will grow much more rapidly than either population growth or even economic growth over the next decade. We are going to have to be able to move that around.The honourable member asks whether or not there will be benefits for rural and regional Australia, and what impediments there might be in the way. I do want to make the point that part of the deal involves a substantial capital injection by the new consortium into rail infrastructure - money which will be added to by Commonwealth contribution out of the money earmarked some three years ago for upgrading of interstate track - if we can successfully secure a vital linchpin in all of this: proper access negotiations for the track through New South Wales so that the Australian Rail Track Corporation can operate a truly seamless interstate track in this country. I can only say that that is very important.Negotiations are well advanced. I sincerely hope that New South Wales will join other states which - regardless of their political colour, including states like Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia - have helped cooperate in rail reform by giving a seamless interstate access. If we can secure that through New South Wales, maybe we can replicate the revolution that has happened on the east-west corridor. Nearly 80 per cent of the freight now crossing the Nullarbor is on rail. The price has come down; the time has come down. If we can do that on the north-south corridor, we can grow rail share substantially, to the great benefit of the overall economy.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the member for Casey for his maiden question. It is certainly the first time he has asked a question but maybe not the first time he has written a question in this House. Can I say in answer to the honourable member's question that today's labour force showed that for the month of January the unemployment rate was seven per cent on a participation rate of 64.2 per cent, the highest participation rate recorded. What that showed is that numbers of people returned to looking for work. The figures for the month of January showed that in the month of January total employment rose by 101,800 persons - 101,800 additional jobs were shown by the figures. I have said to the House on previous occasions that these figures do tend to bounce around a bit but we can take great comfort that of the 101,800 new persons in work in January, as measured by these statistics, there were 70,500 in full-time employment. I think all members of the House will welcome that.  - I hear the interjection of the member for Jagajaga as she welcomes the fact that additional jobs were created.What this says is that it is consistent certainly with the ANZ job advertisements which show job advertisements went up significantly in relation to January. Whilst, as I said, these figures do bounce around considerably from month to month, it indicates that the employment intentions of employers were strong, that we are coming back after the shocks of September 11 in terms of employment, and this is consistent with growing consumer sentiment and business confidence. We do not underestimate the difficulty of the international economy, probably at its lowest level for some 30 years, but I think Australians can feel that we will come through the world recession in better condition than any other developed economy in the world and supported by low interest rates, a first home owners scheme, tax cuts, the taking of taxes off exports - all of the big structural changes which have helped the Australian economy. If we continue that forward we may see continued jobs growth.One figure that the House might be interested in is that since the election of this government in March 1996 there have been 948,000 new jobs created in Australia. We are within sight of one million additional jobs since March 1996. I think all Australians will take that as a welcome sign. We do not want to give up on unemployment - unemployment is still too high - but the rate of jobs which were shown in January will be welcomed by both sides of the parliament.</DOC>

 - To my recollection I had not received any information. The chain of events, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, was that on 7 October, unambiguously, as found in the report I tabled yesterday, advice was provided from a number of sources to the task group to ministers. On the basis of that advice it was subsequently not only referred to in the ONA report, but, more importantly, referred to in a task group report that was prepared on 7 October. That report contains the quite bald statement that children had been thrown overboard. It is undeniable that Defence advised ministers that children had been thrown overboard. That was even reconfirmed in writing by Admiral Shackleton on 8 November. So there can be no argument that the original statements made by ministers were based on advice we had received. That remains the position. It also remains the position that I was not informed by my department that the original advice that children were thrown overboard was wrong.   -  - The Leader of the Opposition says, `How can that be?' If he does not accept what I say on it, I invite the Leader of the Opposition to accept the finding of the report that I tabled yesterday. In a lot of the reporting of this issue and a lot of the commentary on this issue by the Leader of the Opposition the statement is made that my department was informed, but I deny having been advised by my department. The Leader of the Opposition never goes on to say that it was a finding of the report that I tabled yesterday that my department did not inform me and the department reporting to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs did not inform him.Perhaps for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition I should read from page 31 of the report that was tabled yesterday which provides the context of the behaviour of my department. I do not reflect, incidentally, on the behaviour of my department and I do not reflect particularly on the behaviour of the Navy personnel who were involved in this matter. I have nothing but praise for the behaviour of the personnel of the Royal Australian Navy in relation to all of these matters. Page 31 of the report says:Ms Edwards - and she is an officer in my department - reported that, in response to continuing media reports, PM&amp;C had contacted Defence Strategic Command on 9 or 10 October seeking evidence to confirm the initial advice and asking for a chronology of events. The chronology of SIEV 4 events provided to PM&amp;C by Strategic Command at 1201 on 10 October carries the footnote 'There is no indication that children were thrown overboard. It is possible that this did occur in conjunction with other SUNCs jumping overboard.' Ms Edwards indicated in her statement that 'When the photos appeared shortly afterwards, we did not pursue this issue further as it appeared to have been clarified.'Ms Halton - who is now the head of the Department of Health and Ageing - also remembers that there was some media speculation about the alleged incident by Monday and recalls that she told the Defence representative at the Monday or Tuesday meeting ... that they had better be certain about the veracity of the initial reports and they should do some checking. She thinks she told Mr Miles Jordana in the Prime Minister's Office that she had requested that this checking be done in response to the media claims. In her interview with me - that is the author of the report, Bryant - Ms Halton said that at no time did Defence advise the Taskforce that there was doubt about the claim of children overboard.This is a statement of the effective head of the task force saying that at no stage did Defence advise the task force that there was doubt about the claim of children overboard. The report continues:'While we had asked them to check that the statement was correct (Strategic Command did not always seem to have access to information from the chain of command) this issue was not pursued beyond 10 October, as the photos appeared in the press as the `proof' (the photos had similarly never been raised or viewed in the Taskforce).She goes on to say:At no time did I discuss this issue with Minister Reith. I was not informed that the published photographs were not of the incident on 7 October until quite some time after the event - I think it was in November sometime.'It is necessary to indicate that to put into context the references that have been made in the media and by the Leader of the Opposition about the advice that was conveyed to my department. The simple unassailable facts remain: my original statements were made on the basis of advice given in good faith and those statements were made in good faith, and statements were made in good faith by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and by the former Defence minister. At no stage did my department tell me that the original advice was wrong. At no time did the former Defence minister tell me that the original advice was wrong, and I had no grounds for suggesting otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I can inform the House that there are some changes proposed to Western Australian industrial legislation. These changes constitute an industrial relations roll-back on a grand scale. They will introduce a restoration of a Jurassic Park wasteland of strikes, bans and `no ticket, no start' signs. That is what the Western Australian legislation will do.Firstly, the proposed Western Australian legislation abolishes individual workplace agreements which have given 250,000 Western Australian workers higher pay for better work. Let us be clear what it means to increase minimum conditions. It means lower pay and fewer jobs for Western Australian workers. - Secondly, the Western Australian legislation gives unions virtually automatic access to the workplace - and we know what that means, Mr Speaker. As far as CFMEU boss, Kevin Reynolds, is concerned, a right of entry means the right to turn up accompanied by 40 union heavies, and that is the risk that this legislation places on workers and managers in Western Australia.Thirdly, this legislation will reduce normal working hours by five per cent and, on a conservative estimate, that means at least 3,000 jobs gone. Why is the Western Australian government sabotaging the Western Australian economy? It is quite simple. In December, the three largest union donors to the Labor Party wrote to the Western Australian Premier and bullied him into introducing this law by threatening to withhold future donations to the Western Australian Labor Party. The three unions in question - the CFMEU, the shop assistants and the Miscellaneous Workers Union - between them have given $10 million -  - Yes, $10 million to the Labor Party in the last six years. That is $10 million to buy Labor policy and that is 10 million reasons why the Labor Party cannot afford to reform itself. Thanks to a combination of the 60:40 rule and union donations, Labor governments wherever they occur are hostage to the union movement. The Leader of the Opposition knows this. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is a hostage to the union movement. After he got elected, he said he was going to change the 60:40 rule, and then he went along to the ACTU executive and was gently persuaded to change his mind - flip beforehand, flop afterwards. What else can you expect from the Captain Contradiction of Australian politics?</DOC>

 - I thought I said `advice' but I will check that. But if I said `evidence', as distinct from `unambiguous advice', I was wrong, because it was unambiguous advice that I was referring to. I will check that. But if that encourages the Leader of the Opposition, well, be encouraged, mate. I quote from the task force report that was prepared on the seventh: Once in the contiguous zone, the HMAS Adelaide fired volleys in front of the vessel and boarded and returned it to international waters. This has been met with attempts to disable the vessel, passengers jumping into the sea, and passengers throwing their children into the sea.Those were the words that were put into the task group report on 7 October. - The Leader of the Opposition is asking me about my state of knowledge when I made certain statements, and I answer in relation to my state of knowledge when I made those statements. The Leader of the Opposition gets excited about this. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition was making great play of the juxtaposition of this issue in relation to the election campaign. When I look through the interviews that I gave, I see that the very day before the election, in an interview with Cathy Van Extel on ABC Radio National, I had this to say:I have no doubt about the general quality of advice I've received from Defence.And this is me speaking on 9 November, not speaking from the vantage point of reports and so forth. It remains the case that we received advice that children were thrown overboard. That is the advice that I read out. That was the advice that was given. That was the advice that was given to the minister for immigration, and it was the advice that was used in good faith by the minister and the advice that was used in good faith by me. I went on to say:I have not received any advice from Defence to this moment which countermands or contradicts that.That was a statement as to my state of mind in relation to the matter on 9 November. What Admiral Shackleton said in his doorstop interview yesterday, as I read it, related to what was on the video and it did not relate generally to the whole issue. The truth is that we were given unambiguous advice, from people whom we were entitled to rely on, that children had been thrown overboard. Not unnaturally, that advice was made public. At no stage did I receive advice from my department or from Mr Reith or from any other official -  - or from my staff indicating that that advice was wrong. - Mr Speaker, I just repeat again the fundamental facts in this. We received unambiguous advice on 7 October. It was advice tendered in good faith. It was advice that ministers were entitled to use in good faith. They did; they made statements based on that advice. At no stage, as found by Ms Bryant of my department - not as found by me; as found by the person who was commissioned to carry out the inquiry - was advice tendered to me by my department. No advice was tendered to the minister for immigration by his department, and at no stage was I told by Defence, by Mr Reith or by anybody else that the original advice was wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for the question and particularly acknowledge his interest in the great fishing industries of Australia. This government takes very seriously its mandate to keep our nation's borders secure. Whether it be making decisions about who should live in this country, taking appropriate action to keep our country free of unwanted pests and diseases or protecting our marine resources, we have an obligation to stand up for our country and to make sure that we are able to protect the integrity of our borders. I am pleased, therefore, to report to the House that, following an extensive operation in the Southern Ocean, the Australian defence forces and particularly the Navy, in cooperation with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, have last week apprehended two vessels alleged to have been illegally fishing in southern Australian waters. The first vessel apprehended was a Russian flag vessel, the Lena, which was apprehended by the Navy on 6 February. A second sister vessel, the Volga, was apprehended the following day. This particular operation had been going on for almost two months. There was a period of hot pursuit by the AFMA vessel, the Southern Supporter, and then the Navy entered the operation with two vessels travelling something like 4,000 kilometres south of the Australian mainland to intercept and capture these two vessels.I am told that these two apprehended vessels have around 200 tonne of fish on board with an estimated value of $2½ million. These vessels were particularly endeavouring to catch the patagonian toothfish - a very highly prized fish around the world. The catch on these vessels is almost equivalent to 10 per cent of the entire legal catch in Australian waters. These vessels are alleged to have been involved in a major pirating operation. They are not insignificant vessels - over 80 crew are on these two vessels, which are currently being escorted to Fremantle and are expected to arrive next week.These sorts of operations are very difficult. They are conducted in high seas - in this instance, there were more than five-metre waves - with temperatures of less than five degrees, and the winds are almost always strong in these areas. I want to give credit to the professionalism of the Fisheries Management Authority staff and to the work of the Australian Navy in undertaking such a major operation, largely in secret, naturally, in this significant capture and bringing these two vessels to Australia. There are steaming parties on board and when they arrive in Fremantle they will be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions to undertake further investigations.We have a very large area of water that Australia has responsibility to care for. Those waters contain very valuable fish stocks. We take our responsibility to care for those fish stocks and to manage them sustainably very seriously. This operation demonstrates to the world that we will stand up for our obligations in this regard and that, even if it is a long way from our mainland, those who seek to transgress our waters can expect to be apprehended and to meet the full force of the law. I thank the honourable member for his question and assure him and the House that anyone who seeks to operate illegally in our waters can expect to receive the full response from the Fisheries Management Authority and the Australian defence forces.</DOC>

 - I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to congratulate you on your election. I thank the member for Herbert for his question and congratulate him on the strong endorsement by his constituency in the recent election campaign.The destruction of the productivity of agricultural lands by salinity and the degradation of water quality in our key river systems are the greatest environmental challenges facing Australia at the present time. The Howard government, with the states and territories, has put in place a national action plan worth $1.4 billion over seven years to mobilise communities and regions to combat this menace. It is fair to say, I think, that no government in Australia's history has put such a high priority on protecting and rebuilding the nation's natural environment. In fact, spending on environmental programs has trebled under this government since 1995-96. There is a very widespread belief amongst many people in Queensland that Queensland is a state which is not seriously affected by salinity in agricultural lands. This belief has thrived on the absence of proper research information. A more accurate picture has now become available. This shows that no less than 21 per cent of Queensland's cropping lands must now be regarded as high hazard salinity areas - that is over half a million hectares of agricultural land in Queensland. To prevent salinity destroying this land, there will need to be effective management of over 1.6 million hectares in that state.This work has been done by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources supported by the Commonwealth-backed Grains Research and Development Corporation. I would like to congratulate the Queensland minister, Mr Robertson, and the Queensland government on finally putting forward this accurate information about the extent of this problem in their state. In the light of this information, it is now very important that Queensland become an active partner in the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, because this agreement is when signed by Queensland going to deliver $81 million from both the Commonwealth and the state to Queensland communities to begin combating this menace. I encourage an early Queensland signature to the bilateral agreement under the action plan.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, congratulations on your re-elevation to the role of Speaker, and I would like to congratulate the member for Moncrieff on, firstly, coming to the parliament and, secondly, for a wonderful maiden speech, where he highlighted the significance of the tourism industry to his electorate and indeed to the whole of the Gold Coast. Whilst we have not yet received any definitive information about the impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the collapse of Ansett on September 14 and their impact over the Christmas holiday season, I can report to the House the evidence that I have accrued both in my discussions with a large number of members of the House and in visiting a number of electorates, including obviously the member for Moncrieff's electorate. It has become quite clear that drive tourism destinations, such as the Gold Coast covering, as I said, Moncrieff, and the electorate of McPherson, as well as the Sunshine Coast covering the electorates of Fairfax and Fisher, had a fantastic Christmas period. In fact, the member for Fairfax told me that it was the best ever tourism period over Christmas, which is great news. Other drive tourism areas, such as the North Coast of New South Wales - the member for Richmond's electorate - and regional Victorian areas, particularly along the Great Ocean Road covering Corangamite and Wannon, also had a very good Christmas period. Also, the member for Forrest has indicated that drive tourism destinations in Western Australia, such as the Margaret River, had a good Christmas. Mr Speaker, areas such as the Barossa, which I visited with you earlier this year, also did well. But there were drive tourism destinations that did suffer over the Christmas period. They included the Blue Mountains and the Shoalhaven, which were affected by perceptions of bushfires. Rather than the true impact of the fires themselves, it was the media perceptions of the fires that had the greatest impact on tourism business in the Blue Mountains and on the South Coast.There are areas of Australia that have continued to suffer from the impact of downgraded aviation travel. Certainly Alice Springs - I would be interested in the views of the member for Lingiari - and Darwin, the member for Solomon's electorate, did it pretty tough, but I understand from the member for Leichhardt that Port Douglas and Cairns are coming back and coming back off a low base, particularly after the collapse of Ansett. Tasmania and South Australia have started to recover but have suffered some impact. Unquestionably our $150 holiday incentive package has worked as a stimulant. I will say why. - The member for Hunter scoffs. Of the $5 million available, at the close of business on 30 January $4½ million had been sent out. Most significantly, the $150 rebate has been used for travel during the traditional down period from 1 February to 30 April. In total, 29,182 families are using the $150 rebate: nearly 30,000 households are taking a holiday in Australia between 1 February and 30 April as a result of this government's $150 rebate. That sounds like a successful measure to me - 30,000 families having a holiday using the $150 rebate. This one-off support for the tourism industry is having a positive impact. We will continue to work closely with the industry to monitor events over the next few months, and we will continue to work with the tourism industry to help grow a great and thriving industry.</DOC>

 - I will have to check precisely what I said in that interview because I cannot rely on the Leader of the Opposition to -  -  - You ask me to accept the version of something I said on 8 November but you cannot even get right something I said quarter of an hour ago. When you said that I had asserted that I had received unambiguous evidence and I got up and said I thought I said `advice' and you said, `No, evidence', I checked the transcript and it was `advice'. You ask me to remember something from 8 November! I will say this to the Leader of the Opposition: my recollection, when I answered the earlier question, was that the only person I had spoken to on that night was, in fact, the defence minister. I may have spoken to the immigration minister; I will ask him whether I did. I don't remember, but if there is one minister in this chamber who does not need any protection on this issue it is the minister for immigration. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and her interest in job seekers in her electorate. Yesterday and today - the Prime Minister alluded to this yesterday - many of us heard many fine contributions in the form of maiden speeches. This morning I was flicking through the maiden speech of the new member for Hasluck. I came upon an interesting comment that she made which is not new to those opposite but I guess it is just as ill-informed as those that we have heard over many years. She had this to say about mutual obligation:People without employment are being punished by one-sided mutual obligation policies. This notion of `punishment' is 100 per cent wrong. I will indicate a little later how she can set the record straight by visiting many of the numerous programs that are available in her own electorate.This is not a new notion being put forward by the new member for Hasluck. In fact, in the 1997 second reading debate the now Leader of the Opposition had this to say when speaking to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997:I think the most insidious thing about this is the very fact that the bill itself is headed `Work for the Dole'. This must be the most demeaning of approaches and definitions to young people that I can imagine - that you will compel them to work for the dole. The former Leader of the Opposition, in an interview on 3 September 1998, said:Work for the Dole was devised as social punishment.The comment that really goes to the heart of the front bench of the opposition is that of the member for Batman. Speaking to a youth conference in 1997, he said:Now he - referring to the Prime Minister - is massively increasing the social pressures on the most vulnerable young people in our community, the long-term unemployed, through his evil and politically motivated Work for the Dole scheme.This evil program - this punishment - is supported by the Labor Party in the very policy that they enunciated at the last election. Under the heading `Real Results From Work the Dole', it is stated:Labor is committed to retaining Work for the Dole.That was said before the latest and newest member of your caucus came in here and denounced it as being punishment.In the seat of Petrie just last week we announced yet another very successful program run by the Pillar City of Refuge Inc. It has a range of activities which will assist the unemployed, supporting each participant with work experience and training skills in the areas of information technology, web page design, retail, hospitality, catering, disabilities, child care and animal care. I ask you, Mr Speaker: is that, in the words of the member for Batman, supposed to be evil? I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that the participants do not think so. I encourage the member for Hasluck to go back to her own electorate and talk to the people who are have participated in the Work for the Dole program there. Since 1997 there have been 1,012 participants in the member's electorate - in the area that now encompasses the member for Hasluck - and 104 projects. Currently there are a dozen Work for the Dole projects under way. Perhaps she would like to go along to the Fremantle Education Centre which, I am sure, does not consider itself an evil organisation, which is working in nominated schools with the unemployed as classroom helpers, helping young kids with reading programs and administration, and being involved in library assistance jobs, gardening and technology assistance. Or perhaps she would like to go to Anglicare. It is working with the local arts centre, assisting in the production of a free local magazine for young people. Every member of the House on this side understands and appreciates that Australians and Australia benefits from Work for the Dole. What remains to be seen is when you, the Labor Party, will get to the crux of the matter, which is about having outcomes for people and participation. A just society is a society that allows those who are not in paid work to be fully functional members, to be able to have the self-esteem that comes with participating in programs like Anglicare. I say to the member for Batman, the Leader of the Opposition and the new member for Hasluck: go along and visit some of the Work for the Dole programs, see the success that they are having in society and the good that they are adding not only to their own community but to the Australian community as a whole. </DOC>

I do not have precise recollections about dates and times -  - It is easy enough to say `check', but I do not keep diaries that are that comprehensive about when people ring me and at what time they do. My recollection is, and it is probably about that time, that the Prime Minister told me that he was intending to authorise the release of the tape.Opposition members - What did you tell him? - I did not seek to offer advice.

 - I would like to thank the member for Riverina for her question, because I know a number of members have been raising this issue over the last few months. As the member for Riverina and a number of other members have told me, this is a looming and significant problem facing small businesses and the broader community over the last few months and into the future. For example, the member for Riverina gave me the example of the Junee Arts Council - in fact, all the arts councils in the Riverina are being refused public liability insurance because they are volunteer based organisations. All New South Wales arts councils have been asked to postpone any activity or event that might have a public liability component.Another example the member for Riverina gave me was a paint-ball importer and distributor - just a distributor - who has had his premium increased from $1,000 per annum to $30,000 per annum. Snowy Mountains Flyfishing Adventures in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate have been charged a 317 per cent increase in premiums. In the member for Page's electorate, the Channon Community Markets in Lismore had a 500 per cent increase in premiums. In Pearce, the Yanchep Riding School's premiums have risen 779 per cent to $21,000 a year. In the member for Murray's electorate, the Muskerry Moto Park was forced to close because it was unable to get insurance after spending $300,000 over three years establishing the park. The list goes on - and it is not just coalition seats; it is Labor seats as well. In Newcastle, the Newcastle skating rink was forced to close when premiums jumped 975 per cent to $86,000 a year. These are not isolated examples - the issue is spread right across Australia. The most significant response can only come - and must come - from the state governments. It has to come from the state governments because, under the Constitution, the states have responsibility for this area of law. It is not going to matter how much money is paid in premiums, it is never going to satisfy the fact that the number of claims per annum on public liability has risen from 55,000 per year in 1998 to 88,000 per year in 2000.   - Public liability has become a lawyer's feeding frenzy, and it is closely aligned with the fact that the state governments -  - It is closely aligned with the fact that the state governments have chosen to deregulate the plaintiff legal profession, allowing them to advertise `no win, no fee' and at the same time creating a culture in the broader community that suing for public liability is an opportunity to hit the lottery.The states are reluctant to recognise that only they can solve it. Behind the scenes, the states are doing something - but I say it is not enough. Victoria announced on 30 January a $100,000 package to assist adventure-tourism operators, helping them to establish risk plans. So Steve Bracks is saying, `Yes, we do have responsibility, but we are going to contribute $100,000 to it.' Queensland announced on 23 January the establishment of a task force on public liability insurance. South Australia announced on 23 October last year the establishment of a working party. Tasmania has released a paper on it, the ACT has released a paper on it, the Northern Territory has announced that it is holding a series of community forums and Western Australia is in the business of trying to close down small businesses with industrial relations changes, not trying to keep them open by taking a strong and firm stance on public liability. The federal government stands ready to help coordinate the efforts of the states. - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition laughs. Does the Leader of the Opposition think it is a funny matter?  - Do you think it is a funny matter? Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, this is a very significant issue in the community. - This is a very significant issue in the community. Senator Helen Coonan and I are working -  - Senator Helen Coonan and I have invited the states to come to the table with a proposal that provides a national solution to this growing problem. We will work with the states to come up with a solution. We stand prepared to do what we can to try to help the states to address the significant issue. At the end of the day the states know, as does the broader community, that this can only be solved by changes in legislation, and the legislation can only be passed by the state parliaments. There is no other solution to this. If the Labor Party in opposition think it is a funny matter, the Labor Party ought to be aware that this is having a profound effect in the broader community. As members on this side of the House will attest, if something is not done about public liability premiums, not just for small businesses but for sporting clubs and a range of other groups, in fact it will have a more profound effect on those community groups and small businesses over the next 12 months. We stand ready to help and support the states in their efforts, but there is a recognition by this government that more work needs to be done. </DOC>

He affirmed that he was the source of advice to me, and that was very important to me in that context because -  - Pardon? - The suggestion that it was in some way a correction he affirmed.

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and may I congratulate her upon her election to this House. I trust and know that she will carry on representation for the people of north-eastern Victoria in the fine tradition of her distinguished predecessor.As honourable members will know, I announced recently the latest instalment in the Commonwealth's contribution towards the wellbeing and the health of elderly and infirm Australians in the allocation of 8,000 new aged care places to some 400 aged care providers across this nation, worth $150 million in recurrent funding, and also the allocation of $23.3 million in capital grants. This is significant for two reasons. The first was alluded to by the honourable member in her question, and that is that older Australians in rural and regional Australia will particularly benefit with 50 per cent of all the places and 80 per cent of capital funding going to these areas. To take one example, in the electorate of Indi the people of north-eastern Victoria will benefit with 93 additional places allocated to Wangaratta and Wodonga, which the honourable member represents in this place. That includes 50 high care places, 20 low care places and 23 community care places, worth in the order of $2.4 million to that electorate.The second matter of significance in relation to the recent allocations is that there was a record number of high care places in this round. This round involved the release of 2,041 high care places, meeting the needs of particularly frail older Australians. In addition, there is a total of 4,245 low care places and some 1,711 places in community aged care packages. The Commonwealth allocated an additional 22,000 places in 2000-01, 14,000 places in last year's round and 8,000 places in this year's round. May I also take the opportunity of noting -   - The member for Grayndler interjects. He is so interested in aged care that in his first speech in the House in this new parliament he spoke about cricket. Under the Aged Care Act providers of places allocated to them are given a reasonable time of two years to bring those allocated places into operation. This reflects a judgment on the part of the parliament of a reasonable period of time to obtain the necessary financial commitments, to obtain local government and town planning approvals and to build their nursing home, hostel or extension.It is true, as has been indicated - and as I indicated, honourable member for Grayndler - in recent reports that some 2,816 of these places which have been allocated are outstanding and have not been brought online within two years. I inform the House and honourable members that each and every one of those places will be investigated, that each of the providers who have that allocation will be asked to enter into a firm time line in relation to these matters and that if they are unable to bring these places online in a timely and responsible manner then those places will be reallocated.I have also entered into discussions in relation to other bodies where there may be roadblocks to bringing the places online. I had discussions yesterday with the Australian Local Government Association and their president, Councillor John Ross, in relation to any delays which may be occasioned by local government and town planning approval. Providers are being asked to provide some milestones which we can check off against in order to ensure that what the community expects and what the government is responding to in relation to providing these places is actually being achieved. I note that, of the 8,000 places that have been allocated in this most recent round, more than half of the providers to whom places have been allocated have indicated that they will bring them online. Their expectation is that they will come online not within the two years which is provided by the legislation but within one year, and we will be following that matter up.As I said at the outset, this is a further contribution on the part of the Commonwealth government to the care, wellbeing and health of elderly infirm Australians. In the election commitments which were announced before Christmas we added a number of major commitments in terms of increasing the number of aged care places in Australia. We are interested in the wellbeing of older Australians and we will continue to address their needs.</DOC>

 - In the report, Mr Farmer said in a statement:... to the best of my memory, the issue of children being thrown into the sea first came to my attention at the high-level meeting at PM&amp;C on the morning of 7 October. My memory is that this information came orally from a Defence representative at the meeting. Mr Ruddock rang me while I was in that meeting and I told him that we had been informed by Defence that the people on the boat were wearing lifejackets and that some children had been thrown into the sea. Unusually for me I took that call at the conference table and the other participants at the meeting heard me pass on this information to Mr Ruddock ... When you look at the context of the report, you see that one of the aspects of this particular incident which followed on the return of a vessel to Indonesia -  - was that it was becoming very obvious in discussion generally we had had about these matters that the people on board were seeking to frustrate possible returns and numbers of incidents were occurring - and some of them were revealed in the report in this particular instance. There was the information about this being the first vessel where all of the people came with life jackets. Then you had the following up, which you saw as this matter evolved in time, with other incidents of sabotage to the vessel and of people jumping overboard and being, as the report said, thrown overboard. - Yes, that is what I said. - I am explaining to you the context in which I believe what was happening here was quite clearly planned and premeditated. That is what I was putting to you. You have to see it in the context of the -  -  - I will complete the comment I was making. In the context of what we had experienced before and the wearing of life jackets, it is quite clear that what was happening here was premeditated with a view to forcing -  -  - Yes. It was quite clearly premeditated -  - with a view to ensuring that these people were taken on board. The point that is forgotten -  - as people seek to try and use these particular issues to make it appear -  - as if the people who have been coming on these boats were in some way angelic, what you need to understand, is what was included in the report yesterday, and that is -  - It is quite clear from the report - and I just remind honourable members of it. In relation to passengers, the report states:It was clear from an early stage interactions with the SIEV 4 could involve a new level of difficulty. Passengers were aggressive for the very first time in such sightings. They were wearing life jackets. There was concern that they may bring about a safety-of-life-at-sea situation to achieve their goal of landing at Christmas Island.That is the context in which I assert very positively that this was premeditated, planned. They wore life jackets because they were -  -  - I am sorry -  - The only comment that I was going to make is that you only have to go through and look at the full reports that were included in the documents tabled yesterday which elaborate on the degree of difficulty that the Navy had, notwithstanding this particular incident and how it was reported, in dealing with this particular issue involving this group of unauthorised border arrivals. The facts as related in those reports indicate sabotage to the vessel, fires on the vessel, and people jumping overboard and having to be brought back onto the vessel. All of that was clearly premeditated with a view to ensuring that they were brought into Australia rather than being returned to Indonesia. I do not apologise for that remark at all.</DOC>

Let me say that those allegations - that is, the ones regarding the Toowoomba school - were, I believe, responded to by His Excellency. In relation to the other allegations, it is my understanding that His Excellency will, in addition to the appearance on the AustralianStory program tonight, be releasing a detailed statement replying to the allegations made on the Sunday program.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The outback in Australia is perhaps one of the last great frontiers, and this is a year when we are urging all Australians to put it on their travel itinerary - to visit it, to see it, to experience it, to seek to understand it - and I think we will all be the richer for that. It was launched in 1999 with an initial contribution from the Commonwealth of some $2 million. During the election we increased that amount. I am delighted to say that all states and territories across political lines have strongly supported the Year of the Outback and that right across the board, including in this place, the year has very strong support.Two weeks ago I was in Alice Springs with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin; the Chairman of the Year of the Outback, Bruce Campbell; the Mayor of Alice Springs; See Australia's Graham Perry; and the effervescent Ernie Dingo, amongst others, to launch this event. Alice Springs is one of four major centres in terms of population -  Alice Springs, Mount Isa, Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie - covering an area that extends across most of the land mass of Australia. It probably has of the order of 200,000 people across it and yet, as I mentioned earlier, it is one of the most fascinating regions on earth.At that particular event three young outback people were farewelled to commence a journey to Sydney to invite their metropolitan and provincial cousins to visit them in outback and regional Australia. Sally Saint, a student from St Phillip's College, Glenis McBurnie, who is a horticulturist at the Alice Springs Desert Park, and Lyall Woodbury, a student from the Gap Youth Centre, are taking that invitation to Sydney. I certainly hope that schoolchildren there and their parents will respond positively. There are no less than 550 events already listed for inclusion as events centring on the Year of the Outback across that vast area of Australia. There are exhibitions, festivals, shows, concerts, talkfests, cattle drives, camel treks and paddleboat trips. - I hear the Treasurer saying he'll come - and with his family I hope - setting a good example, and that would be just terrific. There is a whole range of events. I urge all members of the House and their families to get behind this and visit the outback. I think we will all be the richer if we come to understand this marvellous part of our economic and social fabric. </DOC>

 - I am sure the whole House would join me in welcoming back the member for Paterson. There were a few people who thought that, when he lost his seat, he might just fade away; but he is back, bigger than ever and better than ever. Mr Speaker, you will be pleased to know, I think, that the House printing bill will be a bit more moderate this year as a consequence.In response to the member for Paterson, productivity is very important to the growth of the Australian economy. One of the reasons why the Australian economy has done comparatively well over the course of the 1990s, particularly over the last five years, is the strength in productivity growth of about 2.4 per cent under this government, compared with an average of 1.4 per cent under the Labor Party. I saw a new convert join the ranks of those who believe that the government has been doing well on productivity. The member for Fraser wrote in the Australian newspaper today, telling us how important productivity is, how important it is to the economy and how the economy is `doing quite well' at the moment. Of course, it is all the result of the Keating government's work back in the early 1990s. That is pretty funny because last year the Australian Labor Party were telling us that the Australian economy would head for a recession and that it was all our work. Now, as the Australian economy outperforms most others in the world and does better, it is all their work. Last year there was a recession and we had `Whelan the Wrecker' trying to put forward economic policy; now they get a new spokesman and, because things are going so well, it is all their good work, even though it sort of happened 10 years ago. What a fine `McMuddle' they are getting themselves into now. He is trying to have two bob each way in relation to his economic policy. What does he say has to be done to run a strong economy? Listen to this from the Australian Labor Party -  -  - It is his first speech on economic policy, which means that he has outperformed his predecessor by one speech. This is what the Labor Party now say is important: stable interest rates and low inflation. And get a load of this: disciplined budget policy, openness to international trade and competitive domestic markets. Over the last five years the Australian Labor Party fought us every step of the way as we balanced Australia's budget after they had left a legacy of $80 billion of accrued deficits when they went out of office. They fought us all the way on low interest rates. - This is well known down at the Penrith RSL, based on what the Penrith ALP told Neville Wran down at the RSL. I quote from a very authoritative source, Mr Glenn Milne. He said that, according to the minutes down at the Penrith RSL - and I am not sure whether the member for Parramatta was there - one of the Labor Party members said:... `people remember Labor's 17 per cent interest rates. Compare 6 per cent and 17 per cent interest rates and that is why aspirational voters deserted us.'The Penrith RSL and the Penrith ALP got it right. We will watch with interest to see if this new found support for the government from the Australian Labor Party can withstand the first whiff of heat. We will watch very carefully now that they have discovered that the government's economic policies which they tried to defeat have brought benefits to aspirational voters. On this side of the parliament, we will continue to deliver good outcomes to the people of Penrith, Parramatta and Australia generally.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. Along with all other members, I welcome him back to this House. I am aware of growing support for the government's campaign to liberate small business, including support from some unlikely quarters. No lesser person than the shadow minister for workplace relations now thinks that small business should be freed from the shackles of unfair dismissal laws. According to the Australian newspaper of last Thursday, the shadow minister took to the Labor caucus a package of measures to help small business, but he was rolled, says the paper, after complaints from New South Wales senator and former union official Steve Hutchins. It is understood that ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, was furious about the package that the shadow minister brought, and she called on the ALP to reject outright any move to help small business.The big question here is: why is it that the President of the ACTU is able to use the parliamentary subsidiary of the union movement over there - the Labor Party - to block important reform for small business? There are two reasons for this. Since 1996, the 10 largest union donors have given no less than $27 million to the Labor Party - those are 27 million reasons why union money speaks louder than democratic principle. The second reason is that more than half of the Labor Party frontbench comprises former union officials. In fact, to his credit, the member for Barton is about the only member of the shadow cabinet who was not a union official, a parliamentary staffer or a public sector employee before entering this parliament.It is well known that the ACTU treats this parliament as a retirement village for superannuated union heavies. In the case of the member for Throsby, who is my former constituent and a resident of Manly, this place was actually her third choice for a retirement village, after the New South Wales upper house and lower house.I congratulate the member for Barton on his campaign to try and break the power of the union bosses. The member for Barton is a third generation Labor member of parliament, a blue-blooded Labor peer and is living proof that the hereditary principle is not all bad. If he really wants to help small business, he will persuade his colleagues to pass the government's fair dismissal law so that small business can create 50,000 new jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I am aware of the strong support that has been forthcoming for the government's policies on unauthorised arrivals. In fact, it would be fair to say that there was very strong support apparent from the opposition for the policy taken by the government on these issues before the last election. The strongest measure of support, I think, came in the outcome to the federal election, if you put together the government's position and the support it had from the opposition. Those who took a contrary view appear to have come from minor parties that received a very insubstantial degree of support. I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's comment about truth in these matters, because it is apparent that this view has not always been universally shared. I am aware of criticism coming from a number of sources, including the New South Wales Labour Council, undertaking campaigns to dismantle the policy of mandatory detention. I am also aware of the presence of trade union leaders at rallies supporting the dismantling of that policy.I looked to see where there are alternative policies, and I have not seen them. In fact, looking to see an alternative policy from the Labor Party before the last election, we saw them endorsing the government's position in relation to border protection and advancing some novel approaches in relation to a coastguard, which I have to say would not have altered the situation one iota and certainly would not have led to us locating any more unauthorised arrivals than we do now, because most of them are located.It was difficult to find any other policies. I looked hard and long. I do not mean to look too much to the back row to see my friend the honourable member for Bowman. I was looking forward to the Labor Party producing some policies on immigration and multicultural affairs in the last election. In fact, the honourable member for Bowman was even suggesting that I might expect to see one. He criticised the government for having a policy on multicultural affairs and thought it did not go far enough. He said:... the promotion of multiculturalism in Australia requires real commitment, leadership and long-term vision ... Labor will make further announcements on these issues later in the campaign.I waited and waited, and of course in the campaign there were no policies on immigration or multicultural affairs. If one looks to see where there was any real deception on these matters, I think it was in the Labor Party, which was not prepared to have the courage of its convictions on these issues that we have seen after the election. In fact, you only have to look at what is being said now on these matters. We have numbers of frontbenchers speaking on this. For instance, the member for Fremantle said at a rally outside Parliament House:It provides a further review of the issue of mandatory detention. The wall has been broken on this issue. Keep persuading not only the members of the opposition but the government too.Then we had the member for Denison, who said on radio 3AK that Australia should allow the detainees, whilst their claims for asylum are being assessed, into the community, released with reporting conditions. That is not detention. It would not work. If you look at the United Kingdom, with an admitted 120,000 people at large that they cannot locate, you see the truth in what I have said about such policies being proven unworkable. In the context of those remarks by his colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition has the audacity to be out there - as he was on 6 February - saying:No-one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. At no stage did Mr Jordana indicate to me that he had been given advice that the original information was wrong. Have I had discussions with him and other staff? Of course I have. As a result of those inquiries, I have been informed that at no stage did I receive any advice from any member of my staff casting doubt on the veracity of the original report. Moreover -   -  - In addition, Mr Jordana has specifically informed me that he at no stage received any indication to that effect. Not only did he not tell me that he had been given advice contradicting the veracity of the original report; he also indicated to me that at no stage had he been given advice to that effect which would have given rise to any such discussion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I know she joins with all of her colleagues on this side of the House in being totally opposed to the practice of people smuggling and utterly determined as a government that we do nothing to give people smugglers comfort or the opportunity to make profits.The Australian government is working very closely with the Indonesian government in a number of practical ways to address the problem of people smuggling. Naturally enough, with the problems that beset Indonesia at the moment - with a new government, with an economic crisis and with some problems in some of the regions of the country - this has not been Indonesia's first priority. But, following the visit that the former defence minister, the minister for immigration and I made to Indonesia in early September last year, as time has gone on we have been very impressed with the strength of the Indonesian response to this problem within the confines of the resources they have available to them. There is no doubt that the Indonesians now are taking measures which are working to break the back of what is a major criminal conspiracy which, amongst other things, undermines the sovereignty of states. Next week, on 27-28 February, I shall be co-hosting with my Indonesian counterpart, foreign minister Wirajuda, a Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling. I am optimistic that by getting together ministers from so many countries around the region real progress can be made collectively to address this problem. Already we have 31 ministerial-level representatives who have accepted to go to this conference, from 27 different countries. Representatives from the International Organisation of Migration, the UNHCR and other organisations will also be present. The conference is a very good opportunity for us to consider all aspects of the problem and to put together a broad framework for how to address it.It may also interest the House to know that Indonesia has established some separate working groups with Australia to discuss effective cooperation in a number of areas - in the areas of immigration, legal cooperation and police cooperation and on defence issues, as these all pertain to the issue of people smuggling.There is substantial cooperation between Australian agencies and a range of Indonesian government authorities on people smuggling. The work we have been doing together, as well as the very strong and determined stand this government has taken against people smuggling, is beginning to have some effect. That is not to say for a minute that we are claiming there will never be another arrival in the future of the kind we have had in the past. We could not make that claim. However, there have been no arrivals in Australia since early November. Honourable members may be interested to know that there have been well over 3,000 potential unlawful arrivals who have been detained in Indonesia. That simply underlines the cooperation between Australia and Indonesia and the progress that we are making as a government and as a nation in addressing this issue.</DOC>

 - I cannot say whether my department has or has not received such information.  -  - I have indeed had a discussion with them about Mr Enniss. Certainly in relation to the issue of people smuggling, I understand that there was an allegation on a television program yesterday that Mr Enniss was some sort of informant for the Australian Federal Police, not for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have had some contact with Mr Enniss, so that is why I am choosing my words very carefully. -  - I know. It's a bit of a set up, isn't it! We had a consular problem with him some years ago and the consular officials from the Australian embassy in Jakarta gave him some assistance. He was in some difficulties in Kupang. To the best of my knowledge, that had no relationship to or association with the issue of people smuggling. It was over a dispute that he had over some fisheries project, or whatever - I am not entirely sure. But it was a project of that kind. In relation to the story that has appeared, this is a matter for the Australian Federal Police. The minister for justice has said that the police are establishing an inquiry into the allegation that has been made.The only point I would make in conclusion is that, in stark distinction to what the honourable member said in a statement that he made or was quoted as saying, whatever the facts in relation to Mr Enniss are - and I would not purport to try to establish those - I do know that in a broad sense, particularly in the investigation of criminal matters in this country, the police obviously try to make contact with people who might be able to give them information about criminal activities. That is the normal practice of police nationally. Obviously, it would be the normal practice of police anywhere around the world. If you want information on people smuggling, I don't suppose you would go and talk to the Canadian fisheries agency. You would talk to people who might have specific information in relation to people smuggling. You would try to get that information and use it. In relation to Mr Enniss, and any role he may have played as an informant, that is entirely a matter for the minister for justice. It is not a matter for me. As I said, my department has had contact with him in relation to a consular matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. If honourable members are interested in this matter, they might care to examine the advice of Major General Powell because Major General Powell and his advisers put together a detailed chronology of the significant events. That was constructed using the operational message traffic and email records and written statements provided by key personnel. Last week I quoted extensively from this document because I thought it was helpful in understanding the nature of the circumstances under which naval personnel were working. It was a very demanding situation, as the major general records. It makes it clear that in a difficult environment - and if you read the chronology you can see that - where, after the vessel was first located and boarding parties were prepared, there were a number of events of very significant concern to any Australian. I note after first light there was the reference that I made last week to a number of the intended unauthorised arrivals threatening to commit suicide and throw children overboard unless they were taken to Australia. That was recorded in a signal from the Adelaide - that there was a disturbance on the vessel, an aerial ripped from the mounting and thrown over the side. There was a boarding party at 8.40 that prevented a number of people from jumping over the side. At 8.43 there was a `man overboard' declared by the boarding party, and they found five people in the water. And then you had six more at 8.49 overboard. And then you had the later situation in which there was recorded these particular events on the top of the coach-house:A man dressing a small child in a life jacket, preparing to throw the small child overboard. - It said:Child not thrown overboard. Child and father returned to the wheelhouse. - It said:Boarding party officer advised child and father under observation in the coach-house.Some other people were then returned to the vessel from overboard. The boarding party then went on board the vessel further and -  - There was then a report at 9.08 that steering capability had been lost on the vessel:Further investigation appears steering sabotaged by unauthorised intended arrivals. Rods bent.It then says there was:... a man, a male, in view of the wheelhouse, threatening to throw women and children overboard. This did not occur. Main engine disabled -  - Because it was not made available to me at that time. - At 10.28 it records:Main engine disabled by the unauthorised arrivals. Cooling lines slashed and fused to engine casing. Rags and plastic thrown on the casing to produce toxic thick smoke.And then you see the final man overboard returned to the vessel. And then it goes on further:At 10.49 Adelaide's damage control team embarked upon the vessel to repair the main engine. Repairs to the main engine completed.Then they found at 12.57 a small fire on the forward end of the deck, which was extinguished. At 1.30 the boarding party was extracted. - Yes, I will, because it is quite illuminating. It went on, and said further:At 5.11 the vessel displayed a distress signal. - It said:There were sabotaged steering rods, bent, chains removed -  - And:engine damaged, cooling hoses slashed and melted onto engine casing. Oily rags and plastic on engine manifold caused more smoke in the engineroom. It was then found that there was water in the fuel and the starter motor damaged.And, as you go on, you find that the vessel lost power:Water in greases. Pumps provided by Adelaide.And it goes on then to record that at 3 o'clock on the following day on the vessel which was still under tow the bilge levels were increasing and pumped by Adelaide.I would not want to draw unnecessary conclusions, but it is quite clear vessels of this type only remain afloat if they have power, if the pumps continue to operate and the engine capacity is there for them. When that was removed by the sabotage that was clearly reported, that led to a situation in which the lives of the unauthorised arrivals and their children were clearly put at risk.</DOC>

 - There is very little that I can say in response to the member for Barton's question that has not already been said by the Minister for Justice and Customs in his media release yesterday and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today. But I can add one point. I did not see the Sunday program in which Mr Enniss's activities were investigated. I have had a brief look at part of the transcript and it is evident there that Mr Moses, the director of operations of the AFP, who was interviewed for the purpose of the program, neither confirmed nor denied that Mr Enniss was an informant. This is consistent with police operational practice and it is something that I think should be adhered to in ministers' answers on behalf of police matters.On that basis, I will say that the AFP has neither confirmed nor denied whether Mr Enniss, or for that matter any other person, is an AFP informant. It needs to be borne in mind, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out, that the police must use intelligence methods to gather information. This involves obtaining information from people who associate with those engaged in criminal activities. Some of these people may be more savoury than others. I make no comment about Mr Enniss, except to repeat that the minister for justice has said the AFP will conduct an investigation and the matters raised in the program are currently the subject of that investigation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. In Western Australia, the Gallop Labor government has released a draft workplace relations bill. This Labor Party bill has the potential to close down new and existing employment in Western Australia's 116,000 small businesses. There are many significant changes covering union access to the workplace and a range of other `mates rates' type issues. But if you just take one example of the impact of this bill you can see the sort of effect it will have on Western Australia's small businesses.At the moment, a worker has 28 days to make a claim for unfair dismissal. Under the Labor Party's bill the time limit is removed and a worker can make a claim whenever they want. For example, say you run a hot bread shop in Northam in the electorate of Pearce and one of your workers is consistently late for work: after warning them, you terminate their employment. Under the Labor Party's new bill in Western Australia you could face an unfair dismissal claim in six months, in a year, in two years or in 10 years. This is a permanent ball and chain on Western Australia's small businesses. It is drafted by the unions and it is designed to close down jobs in Australia's small businesses.The Leader of the Opposition said - and I believe it was in good faith - on 26 November last year that he really wants to `develop policies that support small business'. I say to the Leader the Opposition that in his first policy workshop he can pick up the phone to his mate the Premier of Western Australia and tell him to stop this job destroying bill. If the Labor Party is serious about creating jobs and helping small businesses then the Leader of the Opposition can do something now about it and stop Western Australia's small business job destroying bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his maiden question. I am not altogether surprised that it came to me. He raises a very important issue indeed, which is the question of the shortage of supply of doctors in particular, but also of other allied health suppliers, in rural and regional Australia. The reason that there is an underspend in rural and regional areas on health through Medicare is the shortage of those GPs and specialists. In other words, this particular part of the economy is supply driven, perhaps in contradistinction to other normal economic parameters in different parts of the economy.I am delighted to be able to tell the member for New England that this government has been the first that I ever recall seriously seeking to address this very serious problem. In fact, the previous minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, and I started to address it in the member for New England's home centre of Tamworth. Mike Wooldridge came out with me. We went to Tamworth, Gunnedah, Mudgee, Moree, Ashford and a whole range of places to look at everything -   -  - I am very interested to see that the opposition is not interested in rural health. I will come to them in a moment. The origins of the problem lie more than anywhere else in the neglect under Labor of this critical issue, but I will come to that in a moment. - Yes, since you ask it. The opposition Treasury spokesman says, `So it's our fault?' To a very large extent, yes, it is, and there has been no attempt on your part to redress the problem. I have looked at the issues surrounding base hospitals, inasmuch as they are federal responsibilities. I note that the member, of course, is a recent arrival here from the New South Wales parliament. If ever there was a government in Australia that neglected rural and regional health it is the one you came from! That is the sphere that you came from. I note your great effectiveness in persuading them to take seriously the needs of rural and regional health. I note it. I remember some work done by the previous minister for health, which established that, in all regions of Australia and all the capital cities, the Australians who expressed the greatest concern about neglect of health by their state government were regional New South Wales people.More than anything else, the genesis of the problem that the member for New England refers to lies in the fact that, for years, grossly insufficient numbers of country kids were trained in medicine. The intake in our medical training institutions from country areas slipped to minuscule levels. That became a real issue, because if you accept that around 25 to 30 per cent of Australians come from rural and regional areas, and if you accept the conventional wisdom that overwhelmingly country kids are the ones who will go back to the country after they have trained in a professional area, you need to get your intake of country kids through our medical schools up to at least 25 per cent, preferably 30 per cent. In some of our institutions when Labor were there, the country intake had slipped one, two or three per cent. Under the scholarships and other arrangements that we have put in place, it is now running at around 25 per cent. That is a proud record.The final two points that I want to make - I could spend a lot of time on this - are that we have committed some $700 million of resources in this very important area. I would like to see the New South Wales state government reflect a similar commitment to the health of rural and regional New South Welshmen. The next point I want to raise is this: unfortunately, you cannot train medical practitioners overnight, so the immediate shortfall is proving very difficult to meet, although I enjoy a very constructive working relationship with people like the chairman of the Barwon health division. We work together, but, unfortunately, while we have set the foundation for recovery in place, it will be some years before the increased numbers of rural kids trained in medicine start to ease the supply in the way that I know we all want to happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. It is very appropriate that his first ever question in the House of Representatives should be about Cambodia, because he led the Australian Observer Group to the elections in Cambodia in, I think, 1998 and has shown a strong commitment to Cambodia. I know - if I may add this - he will make a very fine member of the House of Representatives. Call me biased, but I think he will!The Australian government, as members know, is very committed to the long-term restoration of peace, stability and democracy in Cambodia, and we are very committed to the establishment of a credible international tribunal to bring to trial the Khmer Rouge leaders for atrocities committed during the 1970s. The Australian government very much regrets the decision that was made by the United Nations on 8 February to withdraw from negotiations with Cambodia on the establishment of a Khmer Rouge tribunal. We were particularly disappointed with the suddenness at which the decision was made and the lack of consultation with key players, including ourselves and other countries that belong to what was called the Friends of Cambodia Group, including the United States, France and so on. We have strongly supported the establishment of this tribunal. We provided over a quarter of a million dollars to fund research and policy advice in setting it up. We are prepared to provide additional financial support and legal expertise once the tribunal is established. I very much hope in the next few days, after a number of countries, including ours, have made representations to the United Nations, which is what we are doing at the moment, that the United Nations will resume negotiations with Cambodia and we may see this tribunal established. All members of this House would agree that no member of the Khmer Rouge should be able to escape from the terrible deeds that they committed during the 1970s. This tribunal is an opportunity to bring those people to justice and it is very important that the United Nations just does not abandon altogether discussions with the Cambodians but continues to work with them, so we will certainly be encouraging that.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is: I have not seen the statement. I assume that it has been made at the Senate estimates since this House began to sit. Therefore, I will take the opportunity of having a look at the context in which the statement attributed to Mr Moore-Wilton has been made. Of course, I have read the report, but I will wait and see the context in which Mr Moore-Wilton made that statement.Mr Speaker, while I am on my feet, can I add something to an answer that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition? - He asked me about Mr Jordana in my office and I said - and I repeat, because it is the case - that Mr Jordana at no stage raised with me any concerns about the veracity of the original reports. I repeat that. I have checked with my staff and, for the record, I have also checked with the head of my department. He conveyed, during the relevant period, no indications of any advice that he had received which contradicted the original advice. Mr Jordana did tell me that he believed that he may have been told by someone in the former defence minister's office, and perhaps by Jane Halton in Prime Minister and Cabinet, that there were unsubstantiated rumours in Defence regarding the juxtaposition of the dates on the photographs. He has indicated to me that he believed that was very late in the election campaign, around the time that press reports appeared concerning those same matters. He has also indicated to me - which is the fact - that, as those were simply unsubstantiated rumours, he did not raise the matter with me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon, who, perhaps more than anyone in this House, has taken a keen interest in the wool industry over a very long period of time and has seen its highs and its lows. As a key member of the coalition's agriculture committee and particularly in his previous chairmanship of the wool committee, he has played a key role in the reforms made to that industry and can take a share of the pride in the turnaround that this industry has enjoyed over recent times. As the honourable member suggested in his question, wool prices have risen sharply over recent months and broke through the $10 a kilogram mark last week, reaching a 10-year high. That is really good news for Australian wool producers, who have been through a lot of very difficult times and can now look to the future with renewed optimism. Last Tuesday's northern market indicator, which is an indicator of the strength of the market in Sydney and Newcastle sales, broke through the $10 a kilogram mark and finished the day at 1,008c a kilogram. The eastern market indicator, which has perhaps traditionally been the main benchmark, reached its highest level since June 1990 and also went close to the $10 a kilogram mark at 985c a kilo.This represents a significant turnaround, and it is interesting to note that these are the highest prices since about 1990. It is interesting to note who was the agriculture minister at that time. It was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who sat around at that stage and presided over the demise of one of Australia's greatest industries - the wool industry. The Leader of the Opposition saw the wool industry fall around his knees and now he is asking the Australian people to trust him with the whole economy, the whole of the nation. - The reality is that he was a failure as an agriculture minister. He saw an industry that everybody felt was almost indestructible -  - brought to its knees. He had no solutions and no answers. It took the election of the coalition government to start the reform of the wool industry, to put in place the new structures that have radically changed -  -  - Those opposite presided over the decline of wool prices and the reality is that that has now been turned around. The opposition even opposed many of these changes. I know the honourable member for Corio wanted to support them, but he got rolled in his caucus, so we had the opposition even opposing the reforms that have led to this significant turnaround in the industry. The reality is that the wool stockpile has now completely gone. The farmers will receive the last of their payments in relation to the returns from the stockpile - the residue of those amounts - in the next month. Indeed, the industry now has, for the first time in decades, a real market delivering genuine market signals to producers. I am pleased to report that those market signals are favourable. The Chinese have indicated an increased demand and purchasing requirements for the year ahead. All of that underpins a much brighter future for the Australian wool industry. Our great Australian wool industry can once again assert its greatness. It has worked cooperatively with this government to turn around the policy vacuum that occurred under Labor and to deliver a prosperous and bright future for the wool industry.</DOC>

 - The fact basis of that question is wrong in two respects: the first is that the original allegations made by me, made by the minister and also by the former defence minister, were based upon advice we received from the task force and not only was it not unsubstantiated, the Leader of the Opposition provides me with an opportunity -  - The fact base of the Leader of the Opposition's question is wrong in two respects: the original claims made by the government were not based on unsubstantiated rumour, they were based on advice that had been received -  - The original advice conveyed on 7 October was confirmed in writing by a task group report given to me, and given to the former defence minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and it contained an unambiguous statement that children had been thrown overboard.Opposition members - Rumour! - That's a rumour - a task force report is an unsubstantiated rumour! That is the first error in the Leader of the Opposition's question. The second error is that he deliberately - I can have no other conclusion - misrepresented the supplementary answer I had given in the House barely three minutes earlier when I indicated that Mr Jordana had not passed that information on to me, yet the Leader of the Opposition twice represented to this parliament that he had. He is the person who is guilty of deception -  - No, I've only just started. It is important that this House understands - and again it appears that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand or chooses not to understand - the chain of events that have occurred in this matter. The original claims made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, by myself and by the former defence minister were based on advice given in good faith and acted upon in good faith. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has pointed out to the House today, it is indisputable that the actions of people on board that vessel put at risk not only their own lives but the lives of the children on that vessel. The reality is, as pointed out very, very effectively in Alan Ramsey's article at the weekend when he quoted at length from General Powell's report, the naval personnel on 7 and 8 October were acting in very, very difficult and very, very challenging circumstances. I repeat to the House again, and particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, at no stage was I told by my department or by any member of my staff - I repeat, at no stage was I told by my department or by any member of my staff - that the original advice tendered was wrong. I never had a discussion with Mr Jordana about that up until the time when the recording of those events was commissioned by me after the election. - The reality is that the Labor Party is running this `We was robbed' argument in an attempt to try and explain away its own miserable performance. The Australian people voted on 10 November for my government for a number of reasons. In the area of border protection, they voted because they believed us and they didn't believe the Australian Labor Party. They voted in favour of the coalition because they wanted a government that was strong on border protection. They voted for the coalition because they wanted people who could efficiently manage the Australian economy. They voted for the coalition because they wanted a group of people to stand up for the interests of this country abroad. I make absolutely no apology for any aspect of the election campaign that I have conducted. It was an election campaign that was designed to represent to the Australian people our views and our intentions as to how this country -  - should be governed over the next three years. At every stage during the children overboard issue I have acted on bona fide advice. I have acted in good faith. Whenever material ought to have been released, I have released it, including the video, and I have absolutely no reason to be concerned about the conduct of the Senate inquiry, politically biased though I know it will be, and as everybody in this House will know. Let the questions be asked; I am totally relaxed about the answers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and for her interest in this portfolio. The member is a strong advocate for the veterans in her community. I am pleased to advise the House that this is the 60th anniversary of the defence of Australia. The Howard government will continue its strong support for Australia's veterans and war widows. Since coming to government in 1996, the coalition has increased the Veterans' Affairs budget by 37 per cent, that is, from $6.2 billion to $8.7 billion, and it has extended the eligibility for the gold card to more than 40,000 veterans.I would also like to acknowledge my predecessor, the member for Maranoa, who was a most excellent minister and advocate for veterans all over Australia. The veteran community is very much aware of the Prime Minister's strong commitment and interest in veterans' issues. Already this year the Howard government has addressed the anomaly that saw war widows who remarried prior 1984 lose their pensions. Most will now have their pensions reinstated, and I would encourage any widow who has not yet lodged a claim for reinstatement to contact my department to ensure that she is receiving her rightful entitlement.From 1 January, the British Commonwealth and allied veterans over the age of 70, with qualifying service, have been eligible for full access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Howard government is also committed to enabling war widows on income support payments to have their support income indexed to maintain their standard of living and to extend eligibility for the gold card to all veterans with qualifying service from post-World War II conflicts. I have also recently announced the arrangements for a landmark review of veterans' entitlements. This is one of the most significant reviews to be undertaken in recent years in this particular portfolio area. It will bring further clarity to perceived anomalies in the Veterans' Entitlement Act, and especially disability payments. This government has also provided a particular focus on extending care to rural and remote veterans who face special difficulties because of their isolation. Last financial year 50 per cent of funding allocated through the veteran and community service grants was provided to veteran and community groups to develop assistance to veterans in remote and rural communities. Many of these projects were specifically aimed at addressing health and socialisation issues - the difficulties faced by veterans in these remote areas. It is also my aim to give a new direction and vigour to the government's commemoration program this year, the 60th anniversary of the defence of Australia. Their Service Our Heritage has been a great success into the lead-up to the Centenary of Federation. But now that the Centenary of Federation has passed it is time to take stock and to look at new ways that we can look forward to the appreciation of our veterans in the future for the benefit of new generations in Australia. - This is the 60th anniversary of the defence of Australia and there are some very important commemorations that we must make to pay tribute to our veterans and our serving personnel. This government has a very strong record on delivering on its commitments to the support of veterans in our community and it is my high priority while I am the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to continue delivering to these veterans and war widows who deserve our utmost respect.</DOC>

 - It is true that I quoted from that ONA report at the National Press Club - yes, I did. It is also true that - as was revealed, of which I was aware, in the estimates last night - a minute was sent on 7 November to Miles Jordana in my office, and it was addressed to Miles. This was responding to a request from Mr Jordana consequent upon a request by me that we refresh our memories on documents relating to the `children overboard' issue so that I could be properly briefed for the National Press Club. It was not, as was incorrectly alleged in some reports this morning, a request for fresh documentation. What simply happened was that I said to Miles, `We've got the Press Club on tomorrow. Will you go over the material? I would like to see any written material in relation to the children overboard, because I will undoubtedly get a question about the issue,' because it had been in the papers in the morning. There was a paragraph which stated:We are not yet able to identify the source of the information in the ONA report, though it could have been based on the minister's statements. But there may also have been Defence reporting, for which we are still searching.That was what was said in the -  - I am reading from the ONA note. People will make their own judgments about that. They will also make their own judgments about the fact that, quite separately from the ONA report - and I have released this document today, and I will table a copy of it - there was a fax to me at Kirribilli House on the evening of Sunday, 7 October of a document entitled `Options for handling unauthorised arrivals'. This document was also sent to Mr Reith and Mr Ruddock, and it states:Once in the contiguous zone, the HMAS Adelaidefired volleys in front of the vessel and boarded it and returned it to International waters. This has been met with attempts to disable the vessel, passengers jumping into the sea and passengers throwing their children into the sea.That quote is contained in the task group document. I will say this to the Leader of the Opposition, as I said to the media earlier: if this document had been given to me in the refreshing process a month later, I would have quoted from it in preference to the ONA report. I was not, as indicated - and as I indicated in the press conference - apprised by my office of the paragraph in the minute from Jones to Jordana. - You can ask me a second question on that, if you want to - and a third and a fourth; I do not mind. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I am happy to stand here as long as you like and answer your questions on this subject because this government has got nothing to hide on this issue. The reality is that you were done over in the election and you still cannot get over it - that is your problem. You were beaten fair and square in an election. This is the 2002 version of Evatt's outrage after the 1954 election on the Petrov affair. I wonder when he is going to write to a foreign minister about it, Mr Speaker! The facts are very simple. The ONA report was relied upon by me at the Press Club because it was the only document that I had been given. If I had been given the other document, I would have quoted from that. I was not told until after the election that the ONA report had been based on media reports. I was not told that, and, as I indicated to the press today, if I had known that before the press conference, I would not have used it. But it would not, in my view, have altered the veracity of the claims that I made. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects again, `Why?' The reason why it would not have altered the veracity is that I had a document with the masthead of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, sent to me on 7 October - the very day that Mr Ruddock made his statement - and it contained an absolutely unambiguous statement that children were thrown overboard by the passengers. It also serves to remind us that the following day this vessel sank at the hands of the passengers, not at the hands of the Royal Australian Navy. As a result, the lives of all of those children were put at risk. It was only the actions of the Royal Australian Navy that saved their lives. Most Australians are aware that if you deliberately sink a vessel with a lot of children on it you are really putting the lives of those children at risk, and I think that is reprehensible behaviour. -  - Very briefly, I said that I was going to table the document of 7 October. As I indicated earlier this morning at a news conference, I omitted a section of that report because it bears on relations between Australia and Indonesia. It does not have any relevance to the issue now before the House. I took the view that it would not be helpful to that relationship, which I know is close to the heart of those who sit opposite, as it is to many on this side of the House. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to view the material that has been omitted, I am perfectly happy to make it available to him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his maiden question. I congratulate him on his election to this House. I thank him for the inspiration that he has provided for millions of Australians over the last few years. I am aware of the issue of compulsory union levies, and I would say to the member for Macarthur that basic fairness requires that people cannot be charged for services they have not requested. If someone sent me something that I had not requested and tried to charge me for it, that person would be guilty of a scam - a scam, pure and simple. Despite this, unions are now trying to charge non-members $500 a year if they happen to work at places where unions have a monopoly over workplace bargaining. This means that potentially millions of Australians are liable to a $500 a year union tax. I am pleased to say that some decent Labor people have serious misgivings about these compulsory union levies. The Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said:You can't put a tax on other members of the work force and the state can't require the collection of union fees from non-unionists.Good on Bob Carr! The member for Barton, the shadow minister for workplace relations, said in answer to a question about these levies: Before I felt comfortable with that concept, I would want to know why unions are unable to recruit members in a particular area. These are reasonable points that have been made by reasonable members of the Labor Party. The big question is: does the Leader of the Opposition share his senior colleagues' misgivings about these compulsory union levies, which have been described by the Industrial Relations Commission as `little but an attempt to coerce people to join unions'. This issue, which will come before the House shortly, is a real test of whether members opposite believe in freedom of association or whether they believe in industrial conscription; whether they are a democratic political party or whether they are just the siamese twin of the ACTU. On that score, I think Australians owe a debt of gratitude to those members opposite who have had the courage to attack the notorious 60-40 rule; members like the member for Werriwa, the member for Barton, the member for Griffith, the member for Melbourne - decent Labor people who are standing up for freedom and democracy. They deserve the support of all members opposite. In particular, there is the member for Hunter who said that the problem isn't just the 60-40 rule itself, but it is the further rule which says that every member of the Labor Party must also be a member of a union too, which means that the Labor Party is a hock -  - Members opposite, particularly the member for Hunter, have made it very clear that unless there is change the Labor Party will be nothing but a wholly owned subsidiary of the ACTU. I say to members opposite that they will very soon have a chance to demonstrate their intellectual integrity, and their political independence, by supporting the government's legislation to ban compulsory union levies.</DOC>

 - I should point out in reply to that question by the Leader of the Opposition that the letter does record extreme shock. It does refer to her and her husband vividly remembering the shock. I would make the observation that this recollection had not been available some weeks earlier when the initial statement was made to the inquiry. - I simply make that observation. I would also make the observation in answer to the question -  - Seeing as the Leader of the Opposition has raised the question, can I just read from the letter. The letter reads:My memory is that I received a phone call at about 7.30 at night from the Department (Ms Bryant) in which she told me that an officer from International Division in PM&amp;C (I understood this to have been Ms Harinder Sidhu) had conveyed to her that a staff member in Ms Sidhu's section had overheard some Defence Officials at a meeting where, in the tea break, they had discussed the photos and their belief these were not what they were purported to be.So you have a situation where you have a tea-break, it is passed on to a staff member, passed on to somebody else, who has passed it on to Bryant. Ms Halton goes on to say that, from memory, she did not speak to Mr Moore-Wilton but she left a voicemail message. And then, in brackets, the letter says: (I cannot be categorical on this last point). - I would make the point that, if you really wanted to convey something that was critically important and was something that caused shock, I would have thought some attempt other than to leave a message on a voicemail was required. But I put aside the question of whether Mr Moore-Wilton was advised or not. This issue was alluded to in the Senate estimates last night, and I indicated to the House yesterday the recollection of Mr Jordana that he could have had a discussion on the issue of the photographs with Ms Halton. So there is nothing in this letter which is in any way inconsistent with what was said yesterday.It remains the case that that issue was not conveyed to me by Mr Jordana. At no time did Mr Jordana raise that matter with me. It remains the case that I never at any stage received from my department or from my staff any advice which contradicted the original advice on which I relied. And nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has produced or anything that has come out in the Senate estimates has in any way altered that one unassailable fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for his interest in the Australian and international economic situation, which impacts so very directly on the lives of all Australians. I know the home buyers in the electorate of Cook have a great interest in interest rates and the direction in which the economy is heading. The member for Cook will know that through the last year the United States economy went into recession, as did Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and most of Asia. But the Australian economy appears to have survived the largest international downturn in the last 30 years.I think both sides of the House will say that is a good thing for Australia: that we have managed to keep our economy growing and strong through an international downturn. You can think back to just 1990, when the international situation was not nearly as severe and yet Australia was in deep recession with 17 per cent interest rates at that time and a haemorrhaging budget. How much worse would it have been in this international downturn if the government had not strengthened the Australian economy?According to the Economist magazine in its survey of 15 industrialised countries for growth rates in 2002, Australia is forecast on average - an average of all of the forecasters surveyed - to have a growth rate of 3.3 per cent. Not only is it the highest growth rate of the 15 developed nations in the world that are carried in the Economist but it is the highest by a substantial amount. There is no other economy surveyed where the average is above two per cent, and yet Australia is forecast at an average of 3.3 per cent. So Australia is not just leading the world but leading the world by a very substantial margin, and doing it at a time when the international economy is probably the weakest it has been in three decades.Standard and Poors attributed this resilience in the Australian economy to structural reforms, low fiscal debt, stable inflation and conservative macro-economic management. As Standard and Poors have recognised, the government's economic management throughout the course of the last couple of years has managed to insulate Australia against the great challenge we have had from overseas. Standard and Poors praised Australia's fiscal flexibility, underpinned by low public debt.If you wanted one difference between Labor Party economic management and Liberal-National Party economic management it can be illustrated in this way: in its last five budgets the Australian Labor Party ran up cumulated debt of $80 billion. After turning around the budget, this government has now repaid $56 billion of that $80 billion. That is why Standard and Poors can talk about low public debt.  - The Socialist Left member for Melbourne talks about privatisation. What, like the Commonwealth Bank? Like Qantas? Like Australian Airlines? Every now and again the Socialist Left member, as he hovers around the Macquarie Bank, likes to prove he is a modern socialist in favour of privatisation.Let me tell you what the Labor Party's privatisation policy was about: they ran a deficit, they sold off assets and they were still in the red and borrowed $80 billion. It is absolutely extraordinary. We would like to see a modern socialist in the member for Melbourne's modern mantra. We would like to see him go back into all of those merchant banks and tell them how he really is in favour of foreign ownership, how he really is in favour of Telstra privatisation and how he is really going to become a very model of a modern socialist. The member for Melbourne: the very, very model of a modern socialist Melbourne. That is what we would like to see because we might actually get some thinking out of the Australian Labor Party.We welcome back the member for Werriwa. It is good to see him back on the front bench. He is another modern socialist. When he left the back bench of the Labor Party and came down the front he raised the average IQ of both the backbench and the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. Now he engages in a new experiment: is it possible to be a thinker on the front bench of the Australian Labor Party? We wait with interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for the question. It is an important question because Australia, as part of its global approach to combating people smuggling, is pursuing an extensive range of strategies. These involve the regional cooperation model with Indonesia to assist in dealing with the flow of potential illegal immigrants through their territory. We also work cooperatively with other countries. We have been able to do that with Cambodia, for instance, within our region and with other source countries, where we have been providing very substantial aid and assistance. This issue will be further addressed by the regional conference to be held in Indonesia later this month, at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and Customs and I will be present.Late last year, when the Labor Party elected to become part of the solution and not part of the problem, we were able to pass certain laws which strengthened our territorial integrity. This strategy has been successful in deterring potential illegal migrants from making their way to Australia. At the same time, we have also been able to ensure that people who have endeavoured to reach Australia without authority have been unable to do so. That is through a range of measures, which include the cooperation we have had from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Regrettably, there have been some attempts to frustrate our measures. Yesterday, I informed the House of the attempts to sabotage the vessel which arrived on 7 October last year. That involved a substantial destruction of the wheelhouse, the disabling of its engine and steering, and other matters that have been identified. But this is not the only time when we have seen steps of that sort taken.On the evening of 8 November the lives of Australian personnel were put at risk when passengers aboard another vessel set fire to their craft. The information was made publicly available in a statement of 9 November and the information included the minute and an accompanying two-page report from the commander of Northern Command, released by the Minister for Defence. It is not inappropriate that I should quote from a document that is already publicly available.That document identified that the vessel on this occasion was observed dumping fuel and water overboard and that parts of the ship structure had been thrown overboard. The boarding party conducted boarding, which was made difficult by barricades. On boarding, they discovered a fire in the midship's hold. The boarding party officer attempted to extinguish the fire which had taken hold and a drum exploded and the hold erupted into flames. By this time, most of the passengers were off and in the water and the Wollongong had boats collecting them. Tragically, there were found to be two women deceased from what was believed to be drowning.The assessment was particularly interesting because what it said was that the passengers were aware of government policy to return unauthorised vessels arriving in the contiguous zone to Indonesia. They had prepared their vessel to obstruct the Royal Australian Navy boarding parties and had set about deliberately destroying their vessel in order to avoid their return to Indonesia. The fire was deliberately lit, and the exploding drum is indicative of an attempt to prevent the boarding party from extinguishing the fire. That this was a deliberate action by the passengers is reinforced by the fact that they all wore life jackets. There have been other incidents where steering has been sabotaged, where water has been found in fuel tanks and where passengers have deliberately frustrated any attempts to allow the vessels to continue if returned.The violence has not only been confined to boats. On 1 June around 200 people in the Curtin centre in Western Australia set fires in the dining room and in a demountable building, and attacked an officer attempting to video the incident. In November last year at Woomera a series of fires caused damage to the female ablution blocks, recreation and program rooms as well as a kindergarten. On 7 December more fires were lit at Woomera, destroying a laundry and an ablution block. On 19 December further fires were lit at Woomera, and aerosol cans were used as flamethrowers to attack detention officers. Twenty buildings were damaged or destroyed in these incidents, leaving the taxpayer with a substantial bill of about $2 million.People might think that this is occurring only in Australia, but tragically in the United Kingdom a major detention facility, erected for dealing with either unauthorised arrivals or people whose claims have been exhausted, which was a new facility with a substantial degree of amenity, I believe - I have not seen it myself, but I believe it had a substantial degree of amenity - on the reports that I have seen was deliberately fired. That led to very substantial loss of property - a bill of $A97 million. That incident, which was a very substantial incident in the United Kingdom, also led to staff being injured. It is indicative of the difficulties that you have in dealing with substantial numbers of people who are not prepared to have their claims properly looked at and, in the Australian context, a population where something of the order of 70 per cent have had decisions rejecting a primary application.</DOC>

 - I am not offering a comment because I do not know who she is referring to. - I am suggesting -  - that if the Leader of the Opposition or somebody in the Labor Party wants further information regarding Ms Halton's letter, they are perfectly entitled -  -  - If they want further information about her letter, they are perfectly entitled to direct questions -  - I am not suggesting thereby that I am endorsing or disputing, but it is self-evident that if Ms Halton, or indeed anybody else, writes a letter, and unless she has consulted me about the letter before she has written it and has briefed me about what the letter means, I cannot answer questions on a reference to other parties. That is just elementary logic. - I simply repeat that Ms Halton has written a letter, and if the Leader of the Opposition wants to know to whom she is referring then I would encourage the Leader of the Opposition -  - to arrange for Senator Faulkner or Senator Cook to ask her that question. So far as Mr Jordana is concerned, I have already indicated to the House, as I did yesterday, that Mr Jordana had a recollection that Ms Halton may have spoken to him about the photo issue. I said that yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition goes `Oh!' as though that is some kind of stunning discovery. I mentioned it yesterday. As to the other references in the letter, of which self-evidently I have no direct knowledge, because they do not relate to my acts or the acts of my staff, you should therefore ask Ms Halton when she is before the Senate committee.</DOC>

 - First, can I congratulate the member for Solomon for his maiden question and say how delighted we are to have him in the House of Representatives.Government members - Hear, hear! - It was a close thing, but it was a good outcome. The honourable member shows a great interest in this issue, and I am glad to be able to inform him that the government are working successfully to raise awareness and to increase cooperation throughout the region in combating people smuggling, and we are doing that through a range of strategies. First, over the last few months we have been conducting a very effective public information campaign in Indonesia to counter perceptions that Australia might be a soft target for people smugglers.This is, in essence, a three-tiered approach. First, we have done a good deal to raise the profile within the Indonesian community through the media, explaining why it is in the best interests of both our countries to develop cooperative efforts to counter people smuggling. Second, we have reached out to the Indonesian communities in the major fishing areas suspected of being used by people smugglers. Australian Embassy officials have made visits and participated in public meetings in order to publicise the tough approach, including potential punishments, towards fishing crews who are found guilty of participating in people smuggling - for example, people who receive money for ferrying people to Australia. Third, we have been disseminating a good deal of information and material amongst the illegal migrant communities in Indonesia, warning them of the dangers and the criminality of the people smuggling trade.I can report to the House that my department advises me that local communities have responded very positively to the campaign and an increasing number of people are now aware of the risks involved with people smuggling or getting involved with people smugglers in a way that clearly was not the case in the past. I am also pleased with the way the relationship is developing more broadly in the region on this issue. For example, with Malaysia we have developed good cooperation on people smuggling. There has been good cooperation, in particular, between our police and immigration authorities, and that has contributed to the arrest of some key people involved in people smuggling in Malaysia. I also understand that Malaysia is seeking to review some of its border arrangements, which we have welcomed. In July last year, Cambodian authorities intercepted 242 illegal migrants heading for Australia, and they have subsequently prosecuted the people smugglers who organised that attempt. So we are very appreciative of the Cambodian government for the measures they have taken. We have been working closely with Thailand as well in tackling its problems as a significant transit and organisational centre for people smugglers. One of the people smugglers involved in the Cambodian operation was, in fact, arrested in Thailand following his deportation from Cambodia.As I told the House yesterday, we are looking forward next week to the regional conference on people smuggling, so what we are seeing is not just the possibility of achieving reasonable outcomes from that conference but also very good cooperation at the bilateral level. Although, as I said yesterday, you cannot be sure that there will not be further attempts to get to Australia - and there may be - there has been a substantial reduction in the problem in recent months. I do not know about the Labor Party, but I know in the broader community that is very welcome.</DOC>

In relation to the first part of the question, can I confirm the Australian Financial Review report, I would never be so bold as ever to do that, but I can refer the Leader of the Opposition to the letter from Jane Halton which has been released today. I can refer him to the material provided by Jenny Bryant in the Senate estimates yesterday and I can refer him to the reference I made to what Mr Jordana had told me both in the House yesterday and at a news conference today and again, I think, during question time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his second question and I welcome the opportunity to draw to the attention of honourable members the support for border protection measures and particularly those that involve mandatory detention of those who arrive without lawful authority, and for good and proper reasons. For instance, in this place we saw this statement:I believe it is crucial that all persons who come to Australia without prior authorisation not be released into the community. Their release would undermine the government's strategy for determining their refugee status or entry claims.The statement went on:The government is determined that a clear signal be sent that migration to Australia may not be achieved by simply arriving in this country and expecting to be allowed into the community.That remarkable statement was made by former minister Gerry Hand in 1992. It may be surprising to honourable members opposite to know that I supported the statement when it was made and I think it remains appropriate today. I have another statement, but this time it was made in a news conference and, as we have heard some recent comments on this matter, I would like to read it in full for members: The fact is that we want to send a very clear message to anyone who is intending to come to Australia illegally by boat with no valid claim that the doors are closed.I suppose he would be accused of demonising. I go on:Obviously detention is an important part of our response. Detention has been criticised in the past, but I think the value of detention cannot be underestimated.That statement was made by Nick Bolkus, then minister for immigration, speaking on 30 December 1994 in Adelaide. If we could fast-forward to the year 2002 -  - As I said, if we fast-forward to today, we have the Leader of the Opposition saying:No-one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.The member for Lalor has said:There needs to be some form of mandatory detention. It is essential for identity checking, for security checking and for health checking. That is why we have mandatory detention and it will remain our view that mandatory detention is required for such purposes.But while the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor are putting these views, we have a number of other views that are being put. I note the member for Watson had this to say:During the election campaign, Howard spun this on us too quickly. I don't think we had much choice then. I really don't have a great deal of criticism of where we went there. But now we've had a bit of time to reflect on this, what the government is doing is wrong and we've got to educate people to take them along with us on this.The member for Franklin said:We got a hiding for the third time in a row. We need to do something different.The member for Denison, who is a former Minister for Justice - and, I might say, that was when they instituted detention centres - had this to say:Whether or not there is a majority of the community in support of proposals I put forward, there are millions of Australians who are. Millions of Australians expect their parliamentarians to speak on their behalf to ensure that we have a better way of approaching this issue than having women and children and families behind razor wire in Woomera and with a Pacific solution which has been discredited from the start.Then we had some further comments:We got dragged down a very wrong path through a period of almost Australian McCarthyism by a government that is cynically manipulating the Australian community opinion.I might quote the member for Werriwa on some matters that he has had to say in relation to that. - The point I wanted to make - and I will come to this point fairly clearly - is that we now have the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor out there saying, `No-one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.' We also have the member for Sydney out there saying, `The ALP must come out publicly and say that the bipartisanship that occurred before the election was a mistake.' The Labor Party is bitterly divided on these issues. It has demonstrated no capacity for leadership in relation to these matters. It certainly was not prepared to argue on any of these issues before the election and it is prepared to have voices all over the place now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. Many people in New South Wales may have been severely affected by the bushfires. Some lost their homes; some lost their businesses. Many people in the affected regions - not just the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, as the member for Macquarie showed me, but also on the South Coast, the Shoalhaven, around Sussex Inlet, and Wollongong - were affected through the loss of power and the loss of water and telephones for an extended period. I think there is general agreement that it was a natural disaster of extraordinary proportions. Coming on top of the events of 11 September and the collapse of Ansett, the bushfires had a major impact on the tourism and small business related entities of the South Coast and the Blue Mountains. In fact, according to See Australia, the domestic tourism authority, of those people who planned to go on a holiday over Christmas, 28 per cent of New South Wales residents had to change their plans in some way due to the bushfires.The bushfires had a direct impact, but there was no greater impact than the effect on the national and international perceptions of both the Blue Mountains and the South Coast as a result of the fires. Unfortunately, coming out of these events there was a perception that the Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains were completely wiped out by the fires, and nothing could be further from the truth. There was a perception that the pristine beaches of the South Coast were affected by the fires, and nothing could be further from the truth.However, I am pleased to advise the House that, after consulting extensively with local small businesses and working cooperatively with the member for Macquarie and the member for Gilmore, whose electorate is on the South Coast, the government is making available $1 million to help promote these areas over the next few months and help them rebuild the very important tourism trade that they lost over the Christmas period. This is a cooperative effort. The state government in New South Wales has made resources available. We are working with the local councils. I commend the small business communities in each of the affected areas and I commend the member for Gilmore and the member for Macquarie for their great effort in helping to obtain this package.</DOC>

 - I will check exactly what I said yesterday and I will get it before question time ends. If I have any occasion to qualify the answer I am about to give, I will do so. I dispute the allegation in the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition that the advice from ONA cast doubt on the original advice.  What the ONA advice dealt with was the information on which the ONA report had been based. Furthermore, in recollection, what I said to the House yesterday was that `unsubstantiated rumour' was the description given by Miles Jordana to what he had been told. That was his description. It is also my recollection that I informed the House yesterday that the unsubstantiated rumour related not to the issue of whether the original allegation of children being thrown overboard was wrong but to whether the photographs were of the 7th or of the 8th. As I indicated earlier today, it is obviously in the interests of the Leader of the Opposition and others to merge in the minds of the public the two issues - that is, whether the children were in fact thrown overboard or whether the photographs related to the 7th - the date on which the children were alleged to have been thrown overboard - or the 8th. They are related but separate issues. In reality, what the Halton letter speaks of and what the unsubstantiated rumour dealt with was the question of the date of the photographs, not the veracity of the original advice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. Yesterday, ACOSS released a report stating that Australia still has a very serious long-term unemployment problem. Australia does still have a serious long-term unemployment problem but the figures that they have provided saying that there were some 385,000 people on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months do not go to the accuracy of what this government has achieved for those people who were unemployed when we came into government. In fact, at the height of long-term unemployment, which was July 1993, there were 320,600 people who had been unemployed for more than 12 months. Of course, that was under the previous Labor government. That figure is now some 56 per cent lower under this government and today stands at 140,700. It has fallen by 35 per cent since the introduction of the Job Network. Of course, this is a combination of the good economic policy and economic growth which have been delivered by the Howard government. But we recognise that there is more to be done and, as part of the Australians Working Together package, we will inject another $324 million into labour market programs providing things such as $800 training credits to people completing Work for the Dole programs. I should inform the House of some of the latest results of the Job Network and the performance over the last seven months, which are very encouraging to Australia's unemployed. In the seven months to the end of January 2002, almost 6,800 job matching places went to indigenous job seekers. This is a 36 per cent increase over the same period in the last financial year. Forty-five thousand people commenced Job Search training in the second half of the year. This is an 11 per cent increase on last year. One hundred and sixty thousand people have commenced intensive assistance since June 2001, with interim outcomes being achieved by 52,900 of these participants, 30 per cent more than in the same period last year - a clear indication that the government's Job Network is working for the unemployed of this country. Being a government of free enterprise, we have the NEIS system, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, and the commencements for the long-term unemployed and for indigenous people, those that are at risk of the longest term unemployment, have also been increasing. The other good news for our unemployed today is that there were 63,917 new vacancies lodged in January directly by Job Network members - 7,000 more than in January 2001 and 12,000 more than in January 2000. These are jobs that are available for all unemployed people to access, wherever they are around Australia. An additional 43,000 new vacancies from the Fairfax Group newspapers, the government Gazette, Defence recruitment and other Internet recruitment sites have also been advised on the AJS.We are not only delivering better employment outcomes and getting more people into work; we are doing it at far lower cost than the previous government. More employment outcomes have been achieved. For example, it is now costing about $6,200 for each intensive assistance outcome, compared to $12,000 for the program it replaced. For Job Search training, it is costing $1,100, compared to the Labor Party's $2,500. There is more to be done. The government remain committed to the unemployed of this country and to the business community and, if the opposition would support the government, not only in the Job Network but also with our fair dismissal law bills, we would see further erosion of long-term unemployment.</DOC>

From recollection, you asked me about the question that I put on notice yesterday. I have not as yet been provided with the results of the inquiries that would have been made as a result of that. Can I say, having sort of, as it were, been given some different advice - conflicting advice - from this general area in the last 48 hours, I want to be absolutely certain of the advice I get before I reply to the question.

I will obviously seek advice on that, and when I have replies to both the question yesterday and the question you asked me today I will naturally come back to the House. - I am not making any commitment to do that today, because I intend to be absolutely certain of the advice I get before I open my mouth on the subject.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Page and also congratulate him on his elevation to Deputy Speaker. I know he is a very keen advocate of practical environmental outcomes, and I know this Friday he will be going to Lismore and acknowledging 10 young Australians who are participating in the Green Corps project. Just behind him is the member for Parkes - and a very good maiden speech he made also talking about having sustainable environmental outcomes, and he too will be going this Friday to acknowledge a Green Corps project in his electorate. Two very keen marginal seat campaigners, certainly from this side -  -  - The member for Herbert was acknowledging a Green Corps project at Corbett's Waterhole in Townsville - a very good member. And of course this Friday another fine member, the member for Eden-Monaro, will be down at Merimbula again advocating the cause of Green Corps. The Green Corps program is a wonderful opportunity to give young Australians the chance to fix their own environment. - I am glad to see that there is so much active interest from the opposition, because they certainly have not shown it in the past. Of course, it is a partnership that develops between local Landcare groups, whether they be Coastcare or Dunecare. This has been a very successful program; indeed, it was one of the first programs that the Howard government introduced in 1997. Over 7,600 young people have now participated in Green Corps. There are three key objectives that we want for these young Australians. The first is to give them knowledge and experience of their own local environment. The proof has been in the pudding, because of the sheer popularity of the program. There has been so much demand that it is now outstripping supply. I see the former minister responsible for Green Corps nodding his head. It gives 17- to 20-year-olds an active experience. The second is that they be given quality training, particularly in the area of regeneration techniques and habitat protection. It gives 134 hours of accredited training which participants can use to go on to further environmental courses, and there is a fairly generous allowance of up to $300 per week. But the best outcome is for the environment itself. Since the Green Corps project has been in operation, over 700 projects have delivered, through those participants, the planting of four million trees, the erection of 2,000 kilometres of fencing, over 30,000 hectares of weed removal, the collection of five tonnes of seeds and the construction of over 1,600 kilometres of walking track.But the member for Page did ask a very clear question: are there any alternative policies to Green Corps? The simple answer is no. While there has been considerable interest on this side of the House, it is unusual that the opposition have been strangely quiet about this program. I have to say that that is always a sure indication that the government is on a winner. Your silence condemns you. Indeed, this century, in this parliament, only two ALP members have mentioned Green Corps - one of them was the former Leader of the Opposition, who claimed it was a form of conscription. I can just imagine the Green Corps members on the Collins class submarines. But this side of the House is fully supportive of Green Corps. That is why we have extended the program to 2005 to give those young Australians that choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. My department was indeed a participant on one of the people smuggling task forces. By the way, I congratulate my department on the excellent job they did and on the determination they have shown to ensure that this country can be freed from the problem of people smuggling.Opposition members - Answer the question. - As for the answer to the question in relation to the `children overboard' incident, my department had no particular information on that issue at all. The issue is not the responsibility of my department. In relation to advice provided to me on that issue, I have sought still further advice from my department on several occasions this week and they have confirmed to me that they gave me no advice on that matter, which is hardly surprising because it was not an issue for which I had ministerial responsibility.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the member for Forde for her question and for her longstanding interest in education, particularly for the lower income members of her outer Brisbane metropolitan electorate. The Howard government has made enormous inroads by making a further commitment to lower income Australians and their access to Australian education - higher education, vocational education and training, new apprenticeships and schools. For example, the government runs a higher education equity program, funded at almost $6 million a year. This year it will be making loans available for 30,000 equivalent full-time student units, or 65,000 students by the time you include postgraduate students, to undertake postgraduate education in Australia.The government has increased by 678 the number of indigenous students in higher education. In fact, in the 10 years from 1992 there has been a 44 per cent increase in the number of indigenous Australians in Australian universities. There are 9,658 more Australians from rural and remote parts of this country now in Australian universities, due in no small way to the efforts of my predecessor, now the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. We also have 8,327 Australians who carry a disability and who are now in Australian universities since the election of the Howard government. This year, as a part of Australia's commitment to regional Australia, 670 more places in regional universities will be available. That will increase to 1,830 places over the next four years.If you look at vocational education and training, you will see that there are four times as many indigenous Australians undertaking new apprenticeships now than there were when the government came to office. There are 170,000 Australian students doing vocational education and training at school. We now have 6,000 students in Australian schools who are undertaking part-time new apprenticeships. Further to that, 32 per cent of all of those who are doing new apprenticeships in Australia are people from rural and remote parts of the country. Arguably one of the greatest commitments that the government has made to lower income Australians in education is in the area of schooling. There is $2.5 billion more, or a 69 per cent increase in funding, now available through this government to Australian schools than when it came to office. The government has increased by 46 per cent the amount of money available to government schools, despite the fact that enrolments have increased barely more than one per cent since the election of the Howard government in 1996. But one of the other key reforms is in giving access to low income families in this country to non-government schools. Fourteen per cent of the families in this country who earn less than $20,800 a year -  - If you go to the Labor Party web site, there is one policy on it - Knowledge Nation. But visitors to the Labor Party web site are invited to make -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, visitors to the Labor Party web site are invited to make a submission to the policy review, so I would like to make a submission. What needs to be submitted is that 14 per cent of Australian families who earn less than $20,800 a year have children in Australian schools. One in five of those families sends their children to non-government schools, and they have available to them $53 a day. I invite the Labor Party to further consider the 21 per cent of families in this country who earn less than $26,000 a year and send their children to schools, and one in five are in non-government schools.  - Of those families, one in five, earning $73 a day, have their children in non-government schools. - On 26 November last year, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the first visit of the Leader of the Opposition to the western suburbs of Sydney. It mentions Gina and Greg Fletcher from the Bird In Hand Inn. Greg Fletcher, who is a factory worker, said:... the Labor Party's pledge to take money away from private schools had not been popular. - He said:People around here don't have much money but they save and save so that they can send their -  - Greg Fletcher from the Bird In Hand Inn said:People around here don't have much money, but they save and save so they can send their kids to a private school and get a good education and then Labor says you shouldn't try to do this. - What Australia needs in relation to the educational aspiration of its children is practical commonsense approaches and policies, not more divisive class war rhetoric.</DOC>

 - Let me repeat again: I did have a discussion with Mr Reith on that occasion; I did have a discussion with Mr Scrafton. Whether I had a discussion with Mr Jordana on the evening of the 7th, I cannot be certain; it could have been sometime during the day. My recollection is that Mr Jordana was not at the Lodge. The people who were at the Lodge with me were Mr Sinodinos, Mr Nutt, Mr O'Leary, Mr McClintock and Mrs Howard. - Yes! She always gives me very good advice, and I usually take it. It is always wise to listen to the advice that your wife gives you.From recollection, I spoke to Mr Scrafton entirely about the video. The reason I spoke to Mr Scrafton was that he was on Mr Reith's staff and he had been asked by Mr Reith to go to Maritime Command in Sydney and have a look at it. I may have spoken to Mr Scrafton a couple of times. - I wondered who that was rattling around in the kitchen - now I know!I did speak to Mr Reith. I do not think that I spoke to Mr Jordana in the same time frame that I spoke to Reith and Scrafton. I spoke to Reith and Scrafton on the phone. I do not think Jordana was there, but I will make absolutely certain. I try to keep an open house. I really do not want to keep anybody out of this - some of my staff might feel a bit lonely if they do not get named in this little exercise!We did not split hairs. It remains the case that I was never given any advice by my staff or by the department that the original advice was wrong. It also remains the case that this is an exercise in the monumental incapacity of the Australian Labor Party to face a political reality that the Australian public did not believe them on border protection. The political party that has practised deception on this issue is the Australian Labor Party. During the whole of the campaign - and certainly in the person of the member for Brand - you did not want a cigarette paper between us and you. If this issue was burning up the member for Brand, why didn't he raise it during the debate? If this issue was burning up the Australian Labor Party, why didn't they campaign on it? Australian Labor Party wanted to have it both ways. - You wanted, on the one hand, to represent to the Australian people during the campaign that there was no difference between you and us. But if you happened to crawl over the line you then wanted the right to pull apart the policy you had supported for the purposes of the election campaign. We are seeing that again and again. We are seeing the disintegration of Labor's unity on this issue, as evidence that they were never serious about supporting our policy. They did that for political purposes in the hope that if they won they could then unpick it. They were the people who deceived the Australian public. I have not misled the Australian public on this issue. I stand by everything that I have said, and I totally repudiate what the Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to establish.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that the government has made helping young home buyers, and home buyers in Australia generally, very much at the forefront of its policy considerations. That has been done in two particular ways: the first is by lower interest rates and the second has been the government's very successful First Home Owners Scheme. I can inform the House that, since the government commenced this in July 2000 as part of the new Australian tax system, 271,000 Australians have received the first home buyers grant. - A total of 271,000. Of those, 31,000 received the full grant of $14,000 for the construction of a new home. As a result of that, dwelling investment increased by a record 13.7 per cent in the September quarter, the largest quarterly rise in the history of the national accounts. No doubt housing will come off in quarters which are to come because of that extraordinary rise.The variable home mortgage interest rate at present is 6.05 per cent, compared to 10½ per cent when this government came into office. On a $100,000 mortgage, that means Australians are saving $370 per month, which is great, isn't it - helping young families? If you want to compare the home mortgage interest rate of today with that of the Labor Party at 17 per cent, the saving on a $100,000 mortgage - wait for it - is $10,950 a year of after-tax money. And that is on a $100,000 mortgage.The honourable member for Cook, and I think the member for Hughes and the member for Parramatta, are now sitting in safe Liberal seats in outer Sydney. One of the reasons of course is that mortgages in Sydney are much higher; therefore, low interest rates have saved people a great deal more money. In fact, the average new mortgage for first home buyers in Sydney is $183,000. So, if the saving per annum on $100,000 is $10,950, in Sydney the saving could almost be double that in terms of the difference between a coalition government and a Labor government.These are some of the benefits that good economic policy is bringing to the people of Cook, Hughes and Parramatta and in other seats around Australia. We notice that the Labor Party is now talking about changing its rhetoric on interest rates. It would have the public believe that it is now in favour of low interest rates. It did nothing about low interest rates when it was in office, but now it is saying, `Me too - we are in favour of low interest rates.' I will return to this in due course when I get asked a question by the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, who has not asked a question in this parliament yet. He may recall that, back in July 1989 when home mortgage interest rates were at 17 per cent under the Labor Party, he put out a statement, along with left-wing MPs, saying: `In current circumstances, all arms of economic policy will need to remain tight, including monetary policy.'Home mortgage interest rates were at 17 per cent and what was he calling for? - keeping monetary policy tight. It was a classic press release! I am sure he will also remember it because he proposed a new tax on homes over $400,000. We will be interested to see, when he asks his maiden question in this parliament, whether he is still committed to tight monetary policy, 17 per cent interest rates and taxes on $400,000 homes - because we do not actually believe this conversion to low interest rates; we think it is nothing but political opportunism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I must say that I awoke this morning to a media broadcast alleging that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Keelty, had stated that Indonesian crew had sabotaged the boat causing it to sink on 8 October. The commissioner yesterday appeared before a Senate estimates committee and was responding to a number of questions in relation to the sinking of the Indonesian vessel that carried a number of suspected unlawful non-citizens towards Australia. I am familiar with the way in which Senate questioning occurs, and sometimes with some of my longstanding friends, the questioning is somewhat circuitous, particularly when it comes from Senator Cooney. But further responses by Commissioner Keelty -  - Nothing against him. Keelty indicated that the Australia Federal Police's considered view was that asylum seekers were responsible for the sabotaging of the vessel causing it to sink and not - let me stress - the crew. The answer reported this morning was obviously selectively quoted, not in context, and it is worth noting that, in particular, the ABC has since apologised for the report and withdrawn the story. But the issue of course demonstrates what can happen in relation to the way in which these issues are pursued. It is a case here that the unfocused questioning by a Labor senator proved to be an obstacle to the clear understanding of what the facts were in that particular case.The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition was not listening in to the estimates debates last night. He did not pick up this morning a copy of the transcript - as I have - and go through it and satisfy himself as to what was being said. He was quick to be out there picking up the comments and suggesting that they were true. Of course, what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition is that he has now come out and said, `Well, I'm terribly sorry; I got it wrong.' What it demonstrates more importantly than anything else is that trial by parliament won't give you an adequate hearing in relation to these matters. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I acknowledge not only how well he did in the Aston by-election last year but how extremely well he did subsequently in the general election, where the voters endorsed their own wise choice a few months earlier.The fact is that state sovereignty and the protection of international borders are a fundamental tenet of international law and international relations. There is no doubt that, as you go around the world, each country is increasingly looking at ways of ensuring that it has the capacity to protect its own borders. Border control, after all, is recognised in all of the appropriate international conventions and through the whole process of international law and there is no doubt that the international community, broadly speaking, is very concerned about the issue of people smuggling. In the European Union, where I have been recently, it is a substantial preoccupation - people smuggling into the European Union coming through eastern and central Europe. The different European governments are taking different approaches and examining further approaches that they could take to try to address these issues.The amount of support the Indonesian and the Australian governments have for next week's regional conference on people smuggling is witness to the international concern there is about this issue. It is true that not every newspaper in every country of the world agrees with the strong stance that the Australian government has taken on border protection matters. I would be the first to make that point. The London Guardian and the Independent, both newspapers of the left of centre of the British political spectrum, have criticised us for the tough stance we have taken. I think you will find increasingly, not just amongst the populations of like-minded countries but amongst the governments of many - certainly not all, but many - like-minded countries, a good deal of sympathy for the position that the Australian government has taken. I was asked also by the honourable member for Aston whether there are any alternative approaches. In the course of the last election campaign the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, and his colleagues, made it clear to the Australian people that they were at one with the Australian government on the issues of border protection. They agreed with the government on border protection and the war against terrorism, so they agreed that the election should not be about those issues; it should be about a range of other issues. That was the commitment that every elected member of the Australian Labor Party in this parliament took into the last election campaign and people voted for members on the other side on the basis that they supported the government's position on border protection. It is now a matter of record that no sooner was the election out of the way than the Australian Labor Party changed its position altogether on border protection. For a start - and I think very significantly - the Labor Party came out and said it opposed what is sometimes described as the `Pacific solution'. In other words, before the election the Labor Party said it supported the government but after the election it said to people smugglers that, if there were a Labor government, Australia would not stop people landing in Australia. They would not do what the coalition was doing and stop these people landing in Australia. The Labor Party's position is to oppose sending people to Manus Island and to Nauru. That is the Labor Party's position. I am not making that up. That has been clearly stipulated by the Leader of the Opposition.I make the point that, when it came to the great deception of the 2001 election, it was the great deception by the Australian Labor Party that the Labor Party told the Australian public that they supported the government's policy and after they won back their seats they said they did not. That is the great deception. We need to know what Labor members and shadow cabinet ministers said amongst themselves during the election campaign. The member for Kingsford-Smith, who has been demoted - I think appropriately, by the way -  -  - Yes, I think that it is quite appropriate. The longest serving shadow minister for foreign affairs in Australia's history, he used to boast, and now, tragically, it is all over. He said during the election campaign, `On this issue of border protection we will review all commitments.' Did the member for Brand or the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition ring up the shadow minister and ask him what he meant, that this was out of line with Labor Party policy? If so, I think the same standard should be applied to the opposition as to the government. I think we should be told what conversations went on to make it possible for the Labor Party to undertake its great deception during the 2001 campaign. The Labor Party has a lot to answer for, telling people that it supported the government on border protection before 10 November and changing its position afterwards. I think the Australian public will damn the Labor Party for its weakness, for its division and for its hypocrisy. - </DOC>

 - It was not untrue because the statement I made to the House last week referred inter alia to the report of the people smuggling task force, the document that I released yesterday - and that was unambiguous. In fact, you referred to Rear Admiral Shackleton. Rear Admiral Shackleton put out a statement on 8 November confirming that advice had been given to ministers that children had been thrown overboard.That is what Rear Admiral Shackleton said - that is the reality. Once again, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, the sequence of events was that the minister for immigration rang me at Sutherland on 7 October and on the basis of that - which, in turn, was on the basis of advice he received from the head of his department - he made a statement and I made certain statements. That evening, on 7 October, I received the most unambiguous advice imaginable from the people smuggling task force which said quite unequivocally that children -  - The Leader of the Opposition is yelling out, `It was wrong.' We are talking about the credibility of statements based on advice. When I was speaking back on 7 and 8 October I did not have before me the reports that I tabled in the parliament last week. The Leader of the Opposition is carrying on as if I did. I can only speak from the knowledge I have of matters at the time I make my statements and I repeat that at the time I made my statements I believed on the strength of what the minister had said and on the strength of what had been contained in that task group report that children had been thrown overboard. Nothing referred to by the Leader of the Opposition casts any doubt on that. I was asked a question by the member for Lilley. I have had a look at the question that was asked of me by Fran Kelly and there is nothing I gave in the answer that is untrue. I make the observation that she referred to the photographs. There were, in the media about that time, references to doubt in relation to the photographs. I think that, on either 7 or 8 November, there was a report about the photographs on one of the television news bulletins, but in any event any doubt about the photographs was taken over by the release of the video. One of the reasons why the video was released was in fact to see if that could address the question of the photographs. Can I just take the Leader of the Opposition back to the beginning of this. At the beginning of this, there was no reference to photographs. There was no reference to a video. Back on 7 October the statements made were not based on photographs, they were based on advice that had been received. It was given in good faith and the statements made were in good faith, and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has said and nothing that anybody can say on this issue, either today or at any time in the future, can alter that one simple, unassailable fact. We were given advice in good faith; we made statements in good faith on that advice. As I said last week, at no stage was I given any advice which contradicted the original advice given to us which I have referred to in this answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his maiden question in this House. I should express my confidence that, under his stewardship, the electorate of Ryan will once more be one of the brightest jewels in the coalition crown in the great state of Queensland.Let me say that this government is completely committed to more democracy and more freedom in Australian workplaces, because this government has faith in the decency of Australian managers and in the commonsense of Australian workers. Because we have this faith, we prefer workplace agreements to one-size-fits-all industry-wide awards. We are committed to giving workers real freedom to join or not to join a trade union and we do not believe there should be strikes without secret ballots first, because strikes cost jobs, and workers should not have their wages put at risk by militant union officials who do not face a similar threat to their livelihoods. The real issue here is union power, because the last thing that militant union officials want is real democracy in Australian workplaces. The real problem is the nature of the Australian Labor Party. Is the Australian Labor Party a democratic political party or is it nothing but a branch office of the ACTU? I want to congratulate again those members opposite who have had the courage and the decency to criticise and attack the notorious 60-40 rule which is doing so much to destroy democracy inside the Labor Party. I want to congratulate the member for Barton, the member for Melbourne, the member for Werriwa, the member for Fremantle and the member for Hunter. The only member opposite who does not know where he stands on the 60-40 rule is the Leader of the Opposition, who cannot decide whether he is the leader of a political party or whether he is still the president of the ACTU. On 25 November last year the Leader of the Opposition said:The influence of trade unions necessarily has to wane.That is what he said on 25 November, but two days later he went to a closed-door meeting of the ACTU and he emerged from this meeting to declare - listen to this:I am not Tony Blair. I won't forget where I come from.`I won't forget where I come from' - the presidency of the ACTU! Then he went on to say -  - The Leader of the Opposition went on to say:I am not interested in the third way. This was an obvious repudiation of the member for Werriwa who, as members of this House know, is a third way fanatic. It is a very dangerous thing criticising the member for Werriwa, as the Leader of the Opposition has just done. It is a good job the Leader of the Opposition is not a Sydney taxi driver, or he would be in all sorts of trouble criticising -  - I have been asked what opposition exists to creating freedom and democracy in Australian workplaces. As I said, the 60-40 rule is one of the biggest single problems. - Tony Blair has a bit of advice for members opposite when it comes to democracy in the workplace. Tony Blair, in a speech to the Trade Union Congress in Britain, said:Modernise your political structures, as we have done in the Labour Party. The old ways of the Labour Party were the resolutionists, the committee rooms, the fixing and the small groups trying to run the show. That has no future.The Australian Labor Party has no future unless it can throw off the shackles and the straitjackets of union power.</DOC>

 - Can I say it was not untrue. If Vice Admiral Shackleton had given me some private advice which I had not disclosed, then you would have a point. - That is exactly it. - That is precisely it. - Can I just read out the statement that was made by the Chief of the Navy on Thursday, 8 November. He says:An AAP report attributed to me following today's farewell of HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Kanimbla concerning unauthorised boat arrivals is inaccurate. My comments in no way contradict the minister.This is David Shackleton, on 8 November. He continues:I confirm the minister was advised that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard.Can I make the point that, if in fact the proposition is that in some way I have been concealing advice, the Leader of the Opposition would have a point. But the reality is that everything he is relying on is not private advice but, rather, some public comment made by Vice Admiral Shackleton. Vice Admiral Shackleton says that he has not contradicted the minister. He says this on 8 November. So if you are going to start using public comments of David Shackleton's you have a situation that on 8 November David Shackleton has said that he has not contradicted the minister and the minister has been saying, based on earlier advice, that children were thrown overboard. So, if you want to play the game of using David Shackleton's public comments, publicly on 8 November he is saying that he has not contradicted the minister and he is confirming that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard.Can I also take the opportunity, in answering that question, to say this - and I do thank the member for Lilley for drawing my attention to a question that Fran Kelly asked me at the National Press Club: it is very interesting when you go back a few months and read answers you have given and then you listen to arguments that have been put out in the public domain by your political opponents and you suddenly realise that before the election the context in which this issue was seen by the Australian people - and I believe now is still seen by the Australian people - I anticipated and the government understood. In relation to the `children overboard' issue, I said this in answer to Fran Kelly: ... I don't want to trivialise it because it was a traumatic, emotional turn to the issue  -  it's not really, you know, directly on the issue of whether you agree or disagree with the policy that we are pursuing. I mean, the Australian people are concerned about the policy that we're pursuing. Those who support it, support it, and those who don't, oppose it. But that's the central issue in the debate but I have to say to all of you who've sort of raised queries about this... -  - The reality is that then it was clear to me and it was clear, I believe, to the Australian people that -  - the thing that really mattered was whether or not the Australian public supported our policy on border protection. That is what they voted on. They did not vote on the issue of whether children had been thrown overboard; they voted on whether or not they supported our approach to border protection, which was for a strong policy, or the approach of the Labor Party, which was to pretend that they were as strong as the government and that, if they scrambled over the line, they would have plenty of wriggle room to get out of the policy they had pretended to support during the election campaign. Everything that is being done by the Labor Party, and indeed by others, on this issue, including the Senate inquiry, is not about a search for the truth; it is about political advantage.The Leader of the Opposition laughs at that. The Leader of the Opposition would never stoop to try to score a political point! But I will leave the Leader of the Opposition out of it for the moment. I heard on ABC radio this morning Senator Andrew Bartlett talking about the Senate inquiry. He said, `Of course it's political.' When you add Senator Bartlett and you add Senator Cook - Senator Cook is going to be the chairman of this inquiry and, in relation to the Senate estimates investigation, he was literally salivating on ABC television last week; he was talking about a cinemascope coverage of it - and when you put in his cinemascope, what is going to happen in the Senate inquiry will be nothing other than a blatant political exercise, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I think it demonstrates the concern that he has in relation to many of his constituents who are employed in the detention centre environment, particularly at Port Hedland and at Curtin, near Derby. I am aware of a number of incidents where officers for the Defence Force, Customs, my own department and other border control agencies have been placed in very difficult circumstances by those seeking to frustrate our efforts in relation to border integrity.Yesterday, and I think the day before, I read to the House from a report by naval officers in relation to circumstances they had faced where engines had been sabotaged, fuel lines had been cut - particularly as it happened on 31 October - steering gear had been disabled, fuel and water had been dumped overboard and people were jumping overboard in order to flee rescue. We had the deliberate sinking of vessels and, in other cases, attempts to sink vessels.My department has also received reports of aggressive and uncooperative behaviour towards boarding parties. Of course, this behaviour has put the safety of Australian citizens clearly at risk. As the Navy report I quoted from yesterday makes clear, lives were placed at risk when fuel drums were positioned near fire that had been deliberately lit. These are not isolated incidents. The staff at detention centres and others should not be expected to go to work and face violence and potential injury -   - One would expect that members opposite who claim to have some interest in the circumstances in which Australians work and their conditions of employment would have regard to those matters. - As I say, when detention staff go to work they should not expect to be beaten up. The fact is, as I have informed the House before, some of the fires that have damaged and destroyed buildings at Woomera have left a bill of $20 million, and I have to say that these incidents are not isolated. Detention is not easy policy, as the British government is finding. They have had damage to substantial buildings, amounting to something in the order of A$100 million. Again, they were deliberately lit by people who disagreed with the way in which they were being managed and being required to leave. Here we had on television last week a video of some of the unacceptable behaviour at the Port Hedland detention centre last year. In relation to that screening, some of the events that were not shown were the destruction of property and the injuries sustained by officers attempting to end that disturbance. I am advised by my department that 19 officers suffered injuries requiring treatment after rocks and lumps of concrete were thrown at them. - Not all asylum seekers - some. - One or two people throwing rocks do not produce 19 officers injured as a result of those items being thrown at them. In that incident one detainee reported afterwards a cut to the arm. Most members would have seen the incident of 26 January at Woomera, where an APS officer was struck on the head by a rock while attempting to assist an injured detainee. That is what happened. An officer was seriously injured by a rock thrown at his head while attempting to assist an injured detainee. On 19 December, my staff report that six detention officers were injured after being pelted with missiles. In this same incident that I mentioned yesterday, detainees threatened officers with aerosol cans that were being used as flame throwers. A report of that incident notes that some 40 to 50 detainees gathered, arming themselves with bed frames, metal poles and other weapons. I am sure that most members on this side of the House would agree with me when I say that no Australian going to work each day should be expected to have to put up with behaviour of that sort.</DOC>

 - The first part of the question goes to what I had put on notice two days ago. The answer is: no, I have not. -  - The reason is that I have sought advice through the minister's office of, I think, the public affairs section of Defence. There are something like 300 or 400 photos, and I think you have most of them anyway.  - You have a fair number of them, and you know that. Let me make it clear that I am perfectly happy to fully answer after the Leader -  - I was asked the question a couple of days ago by the Leader of the Opposition and I will answer that question, but I cannot answer that question without the assistance of Defence. The Leader of the Opposition will be aware that I was given some inaccurate advice in relation to the photographs on Sunday. I do not wish to unduly labour that point. These mistakes can happen and I move on from that. But I am going to be absolutely and completely satisfied that I am getting the right advice on this before I release any more material, because I do not intend to be falsely accused by the opposition then of misleading the Australian public.As to the question of cropping, I was told on Sunday - and I have not been given any advice to the contrary, but I will check it again - that there was no cropping. - I was told that there was no cropping. That was the advice I had. I am perfectly happy to check that again. I would regard cropping as being quite inappropriate. If I thought people had deliberately doctored the photographs, I would take action - of course I would. I think that kind of conduct is quite unacceptable - it does not matter who engages in it. I am perfectly happy to say that. If that causes anybody who has heard my answer any discomfort, so be it. We are not in the business of doctoring photographs.While I am on my feet, the Leader of the Opposition asked me a couple of questions about some comments that Admiral Shackleton had made during a doorstop interview. Although most of Admiral Shackleton's comments focused on the day and immediately before the election on the AAP attribution of what he had said about the video, it is quite interesting when you go through the full transcript of what Admiral Shackleton said. It actually contains a statement which bears very directly on the subject matter of the Leader of the Opposition's questioning. One of the questions asked by the journalist on 8 November - and it bears on the question of whether any contradictory advice was received - was:On the boat people issue, did Mr Reith ... sorry, did the Navy ever change the advice they gave to Mr Reith?And the advice we are presumably talking about there is the advice about the children having gone overboard. The answer from Admiral Shackleton was:No, no, it did not.In other words, on 8 November, Admiral Shackleton is saying there was no change in the advice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question and deep interest in the educational outcomes of young Australians. -  - I am sorry if I am distracted, Mr Speaker. I am just wondering what the leadership issue is -  - Despair, disillusionment and disengagement amongst young people have many causes, even more manifestations and can take the form of self-harm, drug use, risk taking behaviour, disengagement and disillusionment, both from life and from the education system generally. What this government and what this country is aspiring to do is to see that every Australian - young people and those who are not so young - is able to find and achieve their own potential, whatever that is. For many young Australians, that means that we develop and we articulate a vision of education that sees that Australians remain in the education system for as long as they are able, that they are encouraged and have the opportunity to complete year 12 and to go on and pursue a university education. Many Australians, in fact some 330,000 Australians, are now undertaking new apprenticeships - it has more than doubled since 1996. For other Australians, their natural abilities and their instincts lie in vocational education and training - in TAFE, in new apprenticeships and in all of the fine things which are a product of the great work done by my predecessor.I was surprised last week when I saw that the member for Jagajaga had made a 20-minute contribution in this House on the issues of education, and not one positive remark was made about TAFE, vocational education and training or the legitimate career choices of Australians who choose not to undertake a university education. On the first day that I had the privilege to be the Minister for Education, Science and Training, I opened the Australian newspaper to see a photograph of Tyson Hoey and Melissa Dinon from Salisbury High School in the electorate of Bonython, adjoining the electorate of Makin. These two young people, led by Helen Paphitis, the principal at that school, attend a school that has gone from having only 30 per cent of students complete year 12 and five per cent go to university to now having about 30 per cent of the students go on to university, having completed year 12, with a year 12 completion rate of 50 per cent. Most importantly, through the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation, vocational education and training programs, the support of local businesses and the Jobs Pathway Program, every other student in that school who would otherwise be condemned, as the newspaper said, to a life of poverty is now engaged in some sort of training and/or work.The other point that needs to be made is about Tara Thomson. Five days after my swearing-in, I opened the Adelaide Advertiser, I read about Tara Thomson and I picked up the phone. Tara Thomson is being cared for in the electorate of Kingston by the Hallett Cove Youth Project. I phoned Tara and I spoke to her. She dropped out of school when she was 14 and she has a sister who has followed in similar footsteps. Now, as a result of vocational education and training programs, she has re-engaged with the education system. She has a part-time job and she also has a first aid certificate, of which she is as proud as I am of my university degree. The one thing that the Australian Labor Party needs to understand is that every single Australian should be recognised and respected for the career choices that he or she makes. They should not under any circumstances feel that their choices are debased because they do not undertake a university education, which is the current Labor Party position and obsession.I should point out to honourable members, by the way, that I received a lot of correspondence about this issue. For example, an academic from a Queensland university wrote this:Dear Dr NelsonIt is good to see some commonsense comments regarding tertiary/vocational education. As a university academic, I am committed to excellence and, quite frankly, it is not possible for some students to satisfy our requirements.The one thing that we must do as a nation is make absolutely sure that young people feel that they are not being pressured and forced to remain in the education system beyond their natural abilities, to be studying things to which in their hearts they know they are not suited. The Labor Party might not be interested in young people who want to do apprenticeships, but as a nation we are only as good as the technicians and those people who support us in our professional and scientific endeavours. </DOC>

 - As the Minister for Education, Science and Training, I am very satisfied that all of my staff are doing an excellent job to assist me in articulating the government's policies in education, science and training. The particular staff member to whom you are referring, for example - and I challenge some of the Labor members to do the same - came out to Cabramatta with me on a train to spend the afternoon with street kids re-engaged in the education system through the Links to Learning program. If the member for Jagajaga wants to focus on issues about which Australians are genuinely concerned, how about giving a bit of thought to those young people who are currently undertaking apprenticeships and training and all of the initiatives, supported by all of my staff, which mean that kids who had lost hope have now been given it?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for not only advocating the interests of small businesses in his electorate but also being interested in the interests of all small businesses, particularly those in Western Australia. The Gallop Labor government's proposed workplace relations bill is the biggest threat to small business employment in Western Australia. This Labor Party bill has the potential to undermine Western Australia's 116,000 small businesses, which employ more than 350,000 people. As an example of what this bill could do: the bill proposes to expand the definition of `industrial matter' to allow the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission to rule on any matter in dispute, including social or political issues not connected with the worker's job. For example, taking a printing business in Joondalup in the member for Moore's electorate, if the workers go up to the boss and say, `Look, we'd like to take a day off to go to the May Day rally in the main street of Perth,' and the boss says, `Look, I've got a lot on my plate at the moment; I can't afford to lose you for a day', under the proposed Labor Party laws, that printing business can be forced to not only give the workers a day off to attend the May Day rally but also, in fact, pay them in full. Under the Labor Party's proposed new Labor laws, every day becomes a union picnic day in Western Australia.Small business cannot afford to have its feet put in concrete boots by the Labor Party. The Labor Party says that, under the contract with the people that the Leader of the Opposition has, he is turning over a new leaf. We all recall that. He said he was turning over a new leaf. He also said that he was going to go into bat for small businesses. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there is a very simple opportunity here. Ring up Geoff Gallop and say, `Mate, this is madness. This is going to cost jobs in small businesses. This is going to force small businesses to close. It will be the biggest impediment to employment in Western Australia if every employer in every small business thinks that the unions are going to run the workplace instead of the small business itself.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Obviously, the member represents one of the prime sugar growing areas of Australia. The sugar industry in Australia is obviously very concerned at the prospects of the US farm bill that is going to extend the excessive level of subsidy and support that has been provided over a number of years. At the moment Australia, as a result of negotiations that were undertaken a number of years ago, has a sugar quota, I think, of around 89,000 tonnes into the US market. The US producers, against whom we compete, have been heavily subsidised. On all reports, the farm bills that have been proposed by the House and the Senate intend to continue that.We have undertaken a significant lobbying effort in Washington at a political level. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and indeed the Prime Minister and I have been engaged in that effort, as have a number of industry organisations, including those from the member's electorate representing the sugar industry. Some of the interesting analytical work that has been done with regard to the proposed farm bills by independent sources in the US has indicated that the percentage of the support that ends up going to farmers who really need it is rather low. An independent report published by a Washington NGO, the environmental working group, shows that total farm support payments rose from $7.3 billion in 1996 to $23 billion in 2000, and that the top 10 per cent of recipients - or the wealthiest 10 per cent of recipients - received 67 per cent of the payments. The report further stated that two-thirds of all farmers received no payments. This is the case that we have been taking to our counterparts in the US administration, in the Congress and the Senate.What is the government going to do? We will continue to argue our case with the Americans. We will continue to argue our case within the multilateral system of the WTO - a policy perspective that we have held from the time that we were elected to office to launch a meaningful round of negotiations in the WTO, which is the area where we will see, ultimately, the benefits of trade liberalisation regarding agriculture. We will continue to argue a sound case as far as the Australian sugar industry is concerned. We will continue to work broadly across the markets of the world to open up new markets for the sugar industry, such as those that are opening up in places like Taiwan and other parts of the world. We will not just put all our eggs in one basket, so to speak. We will continue to work on our market access agenda and at the same time argue the case right until the final point as far as the US farm bill is concerned, so that our sugarcane farmers, who operate in an unsubsidised fashion, and transparently, can compete efficiently in the international marketplace.</DOC>

Most of the substance of that question is of course the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, but I heed the member's request and certainly will make a call on the minister - hopefully when he has a spare moment in the near future - to question him on those matters. I might therefore be able to correspond his advice to me to the member. It is worthy of note in many of these issues that my constituents were very strong in seeking the current WTO rules. We have imposed them on the world, and the world seeks to impose them on us. It is an area of great difficulty for the minister controlling that issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question - another member from this side of the House who sees the great value in the unifying concept of Australian citizenship being promoted amongst the almost 1 million permanent residents in this country who are yet to take out citizenship and commit themselves and offer their loyalty to Australia. It is very worth while reminding the House also that this side of the House sees citizenship as a very strong, unifying force - something that is worth while promoting. The value of Australian citizenship is of course recognised and appreciated all around the world. It is astonishing to know that those opposite went to the last election with no policy pronouncements on the matters of citizenship and multicultural affairs, and they have still failed to produce any clear undertaking to endorse the government's programs in this regard.In contrast, the government are honouring our election commitment to add to the critical mass we created by a deliberate campaign last year which saw record numbers of people taking out citizenship and also saw in September the first ever celebration of Citizenship Day. We are honouring our commitment to put $1 million annually into promoting Australian citizenship as the single most unifying force in our community. Last year's very successful promotion of Australian citizenship during our Centenary of Federation year saw a record number of people - in fact, a 56 per cent increase over the same period in the previous year - applying for Australian citizenship. That was just in a three-month campaign which ended at the time the election was called by the Prime Minister. This year the government are committed to working with grassroots Australian communities through service clubs and local governments to encourage their interaction with and encouragement of permanent residents to take out Australian citizenship.It is also important for those of us who were born in Australia and who want an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment and loyalty to Australia to know that affirmation ceremonies - some of which took place on Australia Day with some 4,500 people in Victoria alone and several hundred in my electorate - are another way of members in this place, and indeed the Australian community, coming together. We need to focus in on those things which unite us as Australians: our commitment to citizenship of this country, our understanding of the English language and our support for the rule of law and for parliamentary democracy are all important aspects of bringing this nation together in an even stronger and united way than is already the case. As we live in the best country in the world we should have nothing to fear from the notion of promoting citizenship to those who have yet to take it out.Again, it is surprising that those opposite failed to produce a policy in this regard. I certainly hope that members opposite join those on the government side in our ongoing efforts to promote the great virtues and the unification of our community which Australian citizenship brings. </DOC>

 - I did say that, and I have responded to the other questions. Nothing alters the fact that the statements made by me and by the minister and by the former defence minister were based on advice we received from Defence. I would remind the House again that, in the exchange that took place between the journalists and Rear Admiral Shackleton on 8 November, he did two very important things. First of all, he confirmed in a statement he made that Defence had advised its minister that they believed children had been thrown overboard. And then, in answer to another question, he said that the Navy had not changed its advice to the minister. That is a public statement by the head of the Navy acknowledging that Defence had given advice to its minister that they believed children had been thrown overboard. And then, in answer to the question: did the Navy ever change the advice they gave to Mr Reith, he said, `No, no. It did not.' That is a public statement by the head of the Navy.I know that the Bryant report has given a different complexion to the service advice, but that of course has come after this statement and it has come after the election and it has come after all of the statements that I continue to make in good faith. I cannot stress that too strongly. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, `If you heard this or you heard that' - which I did not - `but if you did.' He is trying to verbal me into saying I did. - For the past few days I have been asked quite a number of questions about this issue. I have no doubt I will be asked a few more before we move on to something else, but that is fine. Can I just quietly make the point that the Leader of the Opposition drew my attention to this by asking me about what the Vice Admiral had said - but remember the context. The Vice Admiral was interviewed after the farewell of the Adelaide and certain words were attributed to him. He put out a statement confirming an antecedent event: namely, that the minister was advised that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard. I find that in the course of his earlier interview he was asked whether the Navy had ever changed the advice that they had given to the minister. He said, `No, no, they didn't.' - I will simply repeat, and then conclude, that there has been a lot of questioning of me and my colleagues about whether contradictory advice was given in relation to the original advice. I am simply pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition and those that sit opposite that on 8 November you had a situation where the head of the Navy confirmed an antecedent event: namely, that the former defence minister was advised that Defence believed children had been thrown overboard. Plainly he was referring to the advice given. The initial advice - and I am grateful for the support from the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion - was that children had been thrown overboard. But, interestingly, the Vice Admiral on that same day in his media doorstop when asked the question, `Did the Navy ever change the advice they gave to Mr Reith' - and the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me that it was the original advice - said, `No, no, it did not.' In other words, he was confirming the original advice. I rest my case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I know she is a very keen advocate of family friendly policies, and why shouldn't she be? There is a very good story to tell of what the coalition has done, particularly when it comes to child care. What we have seen in child care over the last couple of years with the child-care benefit is that there has been a substantial reduction in cost and the utilisation rates have expanded dramatically.I think it is a very good opportunity for the member for Lilley - and I certainly encourage the member for Lilley - to have a look in his own electorate at the fantastic work that child-care centres are doing. He may wish to go and visit Teddy House - he could perhaps check in there next week - a very good centre in his electorate which has been flourishing under the  child-care benefit. I certainly encourage him to take up my advice.Let us look at the facts and what has been happening with the child-care benefit over the last few years. In the last four years there has been a 36 per cent increase in child-care funding compared to the last four years of Labor - $4.7 billion in the last four years and $6.7 billion has been committed for the next four years. Despite all the doom and gloom that was proclaimed by the Australian Labor Party prior to the introduction of the child-care benefit, there are now 20 per cent more child-care facilities in this country than there were prior to the increase - that is 2,118 new child-care centres. That means that there are now just under 200,000 new child-care places available since the introduction of child-care benefit, which has been a tremendous part of the ANTS package. The other important point is that there are now 670,000 children using formal Commonwealth funded child care compared to around 480,000 when Labor was last in government. The reason they are using child care is that it is far more affordable. On maximum child-care benefit rates, for one child in a child-care centre it is $129 a week; for two children it is $269.64; for three children it is $420.86. That is a substantial amount. It is all about giving families choice. One of the reasons why it is becoming affordable, not only because of the increase in payments, is that the last ABS survey of the CPI showed that there was an 8.7 per cent decrease in the cost of child care. Why is that? It is because this government have increased payments through child-care benefit because we believe in giving families choice. We have also introduced a quality assurance program, because we want to see the standard of formal child care increased. It is about giving a safe, caring environment to Australia's most precious asset - that is, our children. That is why the Howard-Anderson government have introduced for the first time since Federation - he is a very good Prime Minister, with foresight - a ministry for children and youth affairs.</DOC>

 - I confirm to the House what I have previously said about my discussions with Mr Reith. I specifically add that he did not convey to me in our discussion the discussion he had with Air Marshal Houston. But as the Leader of the Opposition has raised the evidence that was given before the Senate estimates last night, can I quote some other evidence. This comes from the senior military adviser to the government, the Chief of the Defence Force. This is what Admiral Barrie had to say. Bear in mind Admiral Barrie is the senior military adviser to the government. He ranks in precedence over everybody else. It is very, very interesting evidence. - I go on. This is what Admiral Barrie had to say, and it bears very directly on discussions with and advice he gave to the former defence minister, Mr Reith. This is what Admiral Barrie had to say:But I have to say, in all, that I was never persuaded myself that there was compelling evidence that the initial report of the commanding officer was wrong.This is Admiral Barrie speaking last night, not speaking six weeks ago. `I was never persuaded that the initial report was wrong.' He went on:It was my view that the photographs were simply part of evidentiary material. The really important aspects of this are witness statements and perceptions. And that initial report, so far as I was concerned, ought to stand.Significantly, he then goes on to say:And I never sought to recant that advice that I originally gave to the minister.In other words, last night the most senior military adviser to the government said that he never sought to recant the original advice that he gave. Last night, they thought they had an Exocet from the air marshal. I think you have had a decent torpedo from the admiral. This was going to be the big one. The big one is that the senior military adviser to the government is saying, as recently as last night, that he never sought to recant the advice that he gave to the minister. I think that speaks volumes for the nonsense, the sheer political motivation, of this attack that has been launched by the opposition over the last couple of weeks. You have the senior military adviser to the government saying that. Admiral Barrie also said:And it is my view that the commanding officer's initial report - which was reported to me on the Sunday - and the subsequent events while I was CDF ought to stand.Just remember that the original advice on which my statements were based, the statements made by the minister for immigration and the statements made by the then Minister for Defence were on the reports that emanated on the Sunday, and yet Admiral Barrie is saying that he still thinks they ought to stand. That absolutely closes the circle. This attack by the opposition has been completely blown away by the press release that has been given by the admiral last night.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. He has been very active for many years in pursuing good economic and social outcomes for people in rural and regional areas. I think all members of the House would acknowledge that strong economic growth has benefited Australians, broadly speaking, to a very great degree in recent years, but some of the changes that we are seeing in the economy have left some regions and the people who live in them facing particular circumstances of difficulty as they adjust. The government have been very keen to do what we can to ensure that all Australians, including those who live in some of the `flatter' areas in terms of economic performance, benefit from the very strong outlook of the economy.To that end, the flagship of our regional programs, the $100 million Sustainable Regions program, has seen us announce eight prototype regions. They have been very warmly welcomed in the regions where we have set them up. Seven of them now have their committees announced and up and running. It is interesting that the Queensland government have been claiming this program and the funds in it as one of their own. They can see the value of it, unlike their federal counterparts, who said during the election campaign that they would scrap it should they win. I dare say the relevant Labor member for the north-west and west coast of Tasmania would have noted that, in relation to the Sustainable Regions program just set up in his area, the Cradle Coast Authority Board will form the nucleus of the north-west and west coast Sustainable Regions Advisory Committee. It has been very widely welcomed there. I note that the Advocate, his local press, said:The federal government has done the right thing in using the Cradle Coast Authority to manage the excellent contribution of $12 million in regional funding. It is a credit to the federal government - I hope that will be echoed by the local member - that it has recognised this area's regional approach to development.The editorial goes on to say:If ever an example was needed of the value of regional cooperation and the rewards which can come from it, there could be no better than the announcement of this federal government fillip.There is a whole range of these initiatives that we have put in place, seeking to achieve the objective of everyone in Australia benefiting from strong economic growth and better services. There is Networking the Nation, the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, the Regional Solutions Program, the Regional Assistance Program, the Regional Tourism Program, bonded scholarships for medical students, rural transaction centres, Roads to Recovery - the list is quite extensive. It is a toolbox approach, recognising that no two areas face similar difficulties or can be made to fit similar solutions. The member for Batman took a toolbox approach, too, to regional Australia in the last election, but what it contained was a sledgehammer and a list of programs that he intended to either scrap altogether or replace, in many cases, with loans. That ought not to be forgotten. Labor's approach to regional development during the last campaign was based on loans. The Labor Party love public sector debt. They want everyone back in the situation where they owe money, where they have to repay loans and pay interest.Look at the list of programs that they were going to either get rid of or wipe out. The Regional Solutions Program was to have been abolished. The Black Spots Roads Program, which has saved countless numbers of lives in Australia - and will in the future, because we are continuing it - was to have been abolished. The Roads to Recovery program was to be `retargeted'. I know what that would have meant: they would have given their colleagues in the state governments control of it. We bypassed the state governments; we gave it to local communities because we figure that they know where the money needs to be spent. But not the ALP - they wanted it run through the state governments, and you know what would have happened then.The Regional Assistance Program would have been abolished. The Sustainable Regions program would have been abolished. Area consultative committees were under threat. Twenty million dollars would have been taken out of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program, which has been very much needed out in those areas hit by the deregulation of the dairy industry. Six hundred million dollars, under the stewardship of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to fortress Australia in terms of quarantine and our clean, green image, would have been redirected to an ill-thought-out coastguard. Landcare was threatened, Work for the Dole was threatened, private health insurance was threatened. The Employee Entitlements Support Scheme would have been abolished and Tough on Drugs was threatened. There was no policy from the alternative minister for regional development - no policy at all.It is not surprising, therefore, that Labor members have had their say as Messrs Wran and Hawke have moved around. One Labor member said:'The heartland deserted Labor, because Labor deserted the heartland ...  'The ALP has been a policy-free zone for at least three years ...The most telling point of all was a question asked by one prospective member:'Where is policy made? ... Spin doctors. No principles and policies ...It is pretty clear that the Labor Party, insofar as rural and regional Australia are concerned, do not believe in going out there and talking to people; they just spin.</DOC>

 - I cannot possibly answer that question. How can I know? -  - I thought that over the years I had acquired a few skills, but I did not think that I had acquired a skill to know of conversations taking place between two other people! - Oh, he was out of the country. There are such things as mobile phones. - For the self-evident reason that I have explained, I cannot answer that question beyond repeating what I earlier said in relation to my discussions with Mr Reith. Everybody is aware of the statements made last night by Air Marshal Houston and Admiral Barrie. As to the latter, I can only repeat that as recently as last night the government's senior military adviser said that he never sought to recant the original advice that he gave to Mr Reith. I am pretty happy with that statement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can report to the House that since this government was elected we have now paid off $56 billion of Labor Party debt. I think it is well known that in the last five years of the Labor government they accumulated $80 billion worth of deficits. This government came into office and turned the budget out of deficit - a deficit which the Labor Party said did not exist. Talk about misleading the public before an election! The Labor Party was running around before the 1996 election saying that the budget was in surplus and it was $10,000 million in deficit. Talk about misleading the public before an election -  you went to the 1993 election with tax cuts which were l-a-w, got elected and took them away. Since this government has come into office it has repaid $56 billion of Labor Party debt. In fact, I can report to the House that it is expected by the OECD that Australia's net debt position will be around 5.6 per cent of GDP, falling to 4.5 per cent - taking into account states and territories - in 2002. Let me give some comparisons: the debt to GDP ratio of the United States - bear in mind Australia's 4.5 per cent in 2002 - is 41.4 per cent. In Europe, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 47.7 per cent. In Japan, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 66.8 per cent. Australia is about a tenth of many of the comparable economies of the world. Let me show the benefit that this has for taxpayers. When the Labor Party were in office we had to raise $8.4 billion in taxes to service their debts. That was just to pay the servicing costs of Labor Party mismanagement. After repaying $56 billion of Labor Party debt, we are now saving $4 billion a year in interest payments, which means that is $4 billion a year more for schools, for beds -   -  - No, for all schools actually. Government schools did not have the opportunity of getting that money because you were paying for past debts - that is Labor Party debt-driven policy. - I'll do a history lesson because you need it, old son. You are never going to learn anything from this Leader of the Opposition. - He was a big part of the problem. We can remember all last term - he stood here and he had his little bags of plastic - remember? Remember his Hockey Bear pyjamas? The GST was going to cause Australia to go into recession. The GST was going to cause earthquakes, starvation and all sorts of plagues were going to be visited on the community. He did not do one thing by the time the election came. He never produced a policy - we never had a policy. He will run around and he will try and inveigle the reputations of good, decent, honest people in this place. But I make this prediction: he will never produce a policy. I say to all of the people of the Labor Party: two weeks of distraction has kept the pressure off him announcing a policy, but it will come to an end. When it comes to an end, he will be as naked as he was at the last election. I am not a pretty sight, but as naked as he was at the last election, three years of plastic salads and Hockey Bear pyjamas, where did it all end for the Labor Party? No policy on roll-back; no policy on economics; no policy to take Australia forward. We are watching it again. It will end in the same way. Have your fun now because it will come to a conclusion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. - Thank you very much for the opportunity to elaborate on some of the facts that ought to be known. I notice that the opposition very much seems to want to get out some of the facts in relation to these matters, but when people are going to elaborate on some of the other facts they do not seem to want to hear them. I am aware of reports which record passengers on boats seeking to frustrate efforts to return them from where they have come. This House is already aware of an incident involving SIEV4 on 7 and 8 October last year when more than 200 men, women and children were forced into the water when their boat was `deliberately sabotaged' - in the words in the report that I read yesterday - by the suspected unlawful arrivals. They were the people who were responsible and that was the information that was clearly conveyed to the Senate.But people jumping into the water has happened before, and it has happened since. The fact is that on 17 December four people jumped off a boat which was later sabotaged, and again it was Navy personnel that were forced to place themselves at risk in order to rescue those people involved. There was a similar incident reported to have occurred the next day involving the same vessel.I am sure members would be interested to know whether young children were involved. In evidence before the Senate committee that has been brought to my attention about a vessel which arrived at Ashmore Island on 22 October, Admiral Shackleton had this to say:SIEV7 was a vessel which had entered Australian waters and was at anchor on Ashore Island, Ashmore Reef, in that lagoon. It was in company with the Customs vessel, the Roebuck Bay, and a naval patrol boat, the Bendigo. During the incident, as it were, I think it was about 15 people from the vessel jumped into the water, one woman amongst several women held a child over the side, a young child, by its wrists, and the child was dropped into the water. The child was recovered by one of the people in the water, who swam to the child, raised it from the water and then they were subsequently brought out of the water and back to the vessel. - Admiral Shackleton was subsequently asked by Senator Brandis -  - whether there was a belief among naval personnel -  - that children were being thrown overboard and that that was not uncommon. I want to quote him; you said you want to listen to some naval officers. He replied:If you were asking is there a belief that this is a common event, then I would have to say that that is probably the case.Our Navy and the border control personnel should not be subjected to behaviour of this kind in carrying out their responsibilities and their duties. More importantly, children should never be placed in that sort of situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I appreciate his interest in this issue. Honourable members might be interested to know that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that there are 21.3 million refugees and displaced people, and so, clearly, with that vast number of people it is essential to have an international resettlement program which is both orderly and effective. It almost goes without needing to be said that clearly no single country could absorb that number of refugees, and so there must therefore logically be some orderly process for managing it.Over and above that, there is enormous international concern about the global criminal trade of people-smuggling. This is a trade which is estimated in Australian dollar terms to be worth about $15 billion a year. The simple fact is that it very substantially undermines the integrity not just, by the way, of refugee programs but of more broadly defined immigration programs.Since the honourable member asked, it is interesting to reflect on what other governments have said about this, because there is the occasional hysterical comment in this country about the issue. Jack Straw, now the British Foreign Secretary and the former Home Secretary, a man for whom I have the highest regard, said in February last year, `The system has drifted out of the control of governments and into the hands of criminal gangs.' A Japanese spokesperson at a meeting of state parties to the refugee convention in December last year said, `Smuggling may pose a vast threat to the refugee protection regime.' The Danish immigration minister said two months ago, `The international protection regime can easily be undermined by criminal people-smuggling networks.'Other countries are taking increasingly decisive measures to reinforce their border control. I draw the House's attention to the new US-Canada border security agreement, which includes a focus on deterrence and disruption of illegal immigration. The Canadian Foreign Minister told me the other day that Canada had turned back 20,000 potential illegal migrants from its border with the United States in the course of the last year. The new British white paper on asylum and immigration includes tougher penalties for people traffickers and tighter visa and border controls.The fact that this government may be out taking the lead is not a surprising or unusual thing for this government. But the simple fact is that many governments around the world are determined to make a contribution themselves to destroying this whole process of people-smuggling.The fact is, though, we were pleased during the last election campaign that in this country the Australian Labor Party supported the government's view on border protection. When the honourable member asks, `Are there alternative views?' at first blush, and up until 10 November, you would have said there were not. It is worth remembering what the member for Brand said on the Sunrise program on 7 October. He said that the backbench supported the border protection bill and continued:They did not support it under duress. They support it with pride ...That presents the public with a particular message, doesn't it? Before the election -  ironically on a date they love to quote - on 7 October, the Labor Party was saying that it supported the government's position on border protection `with pride'.It is therefore of great interest to Australians that there is suddenly, after 10 November is out of the way, a new Labor Party policy on this issue. The Labor Party went into the last election promising people who voted Labor that they would support the government on the issue of border protection. As soon as the election was over, they changed their minds. They supported us with pride before the election and now they condemn the government. The member for Sydney is an example. It would be interesting to see what brochures she put around in the electorate of Sydney during the last election. I do not live in the electorate of Sydney; I live in the electorate of Mayo, which is a particularly fine and supportive electorate. On 12 December, the member for Sydney said: The ALP must come out publicly and say that the bipartisanship that occurred before the election was a mistake.So the member for Sydney went into the election proudly supporting the government on this issue and after the election said that it was a mistake. The member for Fremantle was `ashamed she did not speak sooner'. That is what she said on 4 February. And the member for Denison said, `We got dragged down the wrong path.' The fact is, the Labor Party said one thing before the election - it made one commitment to the Australian public before the election - and is now saying another.Would some people, particularly Labor members in marginal seats - those seats where they just scraped over the line - like the member for Brisbane, the member for Griffith and so on, have won if the Labor Party had told the truth about what they really thought on this issue at the last election? The answer is that if you had told the Australian public the truth of your position at the last election you would have a lot fewer members here today than you do have. There are members on the Labor Party benches who are sitting there by virtue of a great deception. That is the great lie of the 2001 election: that you said one thing to the public before the election and you did another thing after. - Mr Speaker, I apologise for that. On 6 February, the Leader of the Opposition said on the Sunrise program, a program apparently favoured by the Labor Party:No one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.The member for Sydney has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention. What is the view of the member for Fremantle or the member for Denison, and indeed many others, on this issue? How is it that the Leader of the Opposition has not heard what they have said? Is the Leader of the Opposition telling the truth when he says that he has not heard? Is that the truth? Only yesterday he had to apologise for telling a lie. All I can say is that the lack of integrity from the Labor Party after this election is just as it was after the 1993 election, when you promised the l-a-w tax cuts and you took them away after the voters voted. You promised you would support us on border protection up to 10 November and now you do not. I think it is a disgraceful deception.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I am not aware of what has just been tabled in the estimates, but I will find out. But I tell you what, I am aware of what he said last night. What he said last night has been in no way withdrawn. You cannot avoid the plain English meaning of: I never sought to recant that advice that I originally gave to the minister. The reality is that this whole debate is about the state of knowledge of myself and the minister and others at the time of the election. That is what it is about. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects about deception. The reality, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has just illustrated, is that the real deceivers on border protection are the members of the Australian Labor Party. They are the real deceivers. They are the ones who have been demonstrated since the election to have said one thing to hold on to their seats and then behave in a different way now that they have been re-elected. The fact remains that the most senior military adviser to the government had this to say:It was my view that the photographs were simply part of evidentiary material. The really important aspects of this are witness statements and perceptions.That additional report, so far as I was concerned, ought to stand:I never sought to recant that advice that I originally gave to the minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. It obviously has not been tediously repetitious enough for the Leader of the Opposition to know that the cable he has just referred to was referred to by me on numerous occasions in the Powell report that was tabled by the Prime Minister. -  - The direct terms were used and it is recorded in Hansard very clearly. But I thank the opposition whip for giving me the opportunity to clarify that matter.I am aware that threats have been made to personnel carrying out their duties in protecting the integrity of our borders, and it is not just one recent matter, nor has it been isolated. In the situation report prepared on incidents occurring near Ashmore Reef on 8 September last year, it was recorded that when the Navy boarded the vessel known as the Aceng:Threats have been made to the HMAS Warramunga boarding party and physical jostling, including grabbing and hitting, occurred. Naval personnel have been subjected to this practice on a number of occasions. Only this morning in the Senate estimates committee, Admiral Ritchie gave evidence to indicate that it was not uncommon for people arriving on boats to threaten boarding parties. Admiral Ritchie observed, as I have observed, that these were young sailors doing a difficult job and doing it well. This House, of course, is aware - other than the Leader of the Opposition - of the events surrounding the vessel known as SIEV4 at Christmas Island. It is instructive that I should go through some of those details again. The chronology to the Powell report was sourced from the cables from HMAS Adelaide. Each of those cables documents the incidents in relation to threatened suicide and threats to throw children overboard, but they also detail the number of people who jumped over the side, totalling in all 13 separate events. It dealt with the small child in a life jacket, a parent preparing to throw that small child overboard and the efforts of the Australian personnel to prevent that particular event from occurring. More importantly, the cables recall that steering capacity was lost, that following investigation it appeared that the steering had been sabotaged by the unauthorised noncitizens, that there was a further male in view of the wheelhouse threatening to throw women and children overboard. This did not occur -  - Yes. As I said, that was the cable you have just tabled and that was the cable recorded here which I have outlined on two separate occasions in this House. Further, the cable recalls that the main engine was disabled by the unlawful noncitizens, the cooling lines were slashed and fused to the engine casing, rags and plastic had been thrown on the casing to produce thick toxic smoke, there was the final man overboard, a fire which had been lit on the foredeck was extinguished and then, when the vessel had been put under way again, it displayed a distress signal. The cable records, after that, `sabotage, steering rods bent and chains removed, engine damaged, cooling hoses slashed and melted onto engine casing, oily rags and plastic on engine manifold to cause more smoke in the engine room.' Then they found that there was water in the fuel, a starter motor had been damaged and the rocker cover was missing. A fortnight later, off Christmas Island, there was another vessel. The report about that stated that the engine and gearbox had been extensively damaged by people on the boat. Again, on 17 December, off the Ashmore Islands, another boat arrived and reports show that `two small fires were extinguished by the boarding party'. The next day, reports were received that both engines on this vessel had been sabotaged. As a result of some of these events, people have lost their lives, tragically - not Australians but other people who were passengers on this vessel. Let me make it very clear: I do not blame everyone, but there are people who have been determined to put our personnel under duress and who have been determined to make unauthorised arrivals. They have either decided themselves or have been advised to take a course of action to frustrate our border protection measures. That has endangered people's lives, it has meant that people have been injured, it has meant that people have been hurt and it is a proper matter for not only the government but also this parliament and the people of Australia to be very concerned about.</DOC>

 - I am broadly aware of the evidence given by Brigadier Bornholt and, for the purposes of answering this question, I will not dispute the version given by the Leader of the Opposition. That is a fairly dangerous thing for me to do but, for the purposes of this, I will not. As to the question of the version of events from Mr Scrafton and Mr Hampton, I gather both of them gave statements, and this issue is broadly canvassed in the Bryant report. As to that, I have no knowledge.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. I am aware of a recent survey conducted by the Australian Workers Union, which is a registered organisation under the Workplace Relations Act. I am delighted that the Workplace Relations Act gives unions the freedom and flexibility to conduct surveys of this sort. The survey revealed that 83 per cent of AWU members thought that the Prime Minister was right to take a strong stance against illegal immigrants. This backs up another survey by the New South Wales Labour Council which showed that 58 per cent of unionists thought that the Prime Minister had handled the boat people issue well or very well. It is very clear that Australian workers trust this government and they trust this Prime Minister to deliver a strong border protection policy. They do not trust and they cannot trust the Labor Party on this issue. They know that the Labor Party said one thing during the election fully intending to do a completely different thing after the election. Let me quote the member for Fremantle, speaking in the Financial Review, published on 30 November. She said:On several occasions, I was reassured, as I am sure others were, that we should simply 'wait until we are in government' to enunciate and implement policies consistent with our values.Well, Mr Speaker, `Wait until we are in government to enunciate and implement policies consistent with our government.' The member for Fremantle never tells fibs, so the member for O'Connor tells me. I think the member for Fremantle should be called before a Senate estimates committee and she should be cross-examined as to exactly who in the Labor Party was propagating the great lie that the Labor Party supported the government's border protection policy - the great lie which, according to the Labor Party's secretary Geoff Walsh, was responsible for preventing an anti-Labor landslide at the last election. Let me quote Mr Bill Shorten, who is the boss of the Australian Workers Union. Quoted in today's Daily Telegraph, Mr Shorten told the National Press Club yesterday:... if the Labor Opposition could develop positive and `principled' policies ... they could regain their blue collar support lost at the election.They are not going to regain that blue-collar support because they cannot develop principled policies because, on the issue of border protection, the Labor Party has clearly sold out to the caffelatte set. The workers of Australia fully understand that when it comes to border protection this Prime Minister stands foursquare with the spirit of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. He is much closer to the spirit of John Curtin and Ben Chifley than the Leader of the Opposition is. The workers of Australia understand that when it comes to border protection the Leader of the Opposition is nothing but a gutless wonder. He is very good at throwing smears across this chamber, but he cannot impose discipline on his own party. - Mr Speaker, to help you and to assist the House, I withdraw it. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to prove me wrong. - Mr Speaker, I withdraw unconditionally. - </DOC>

 - Mr Moore-Wilton has not misled the Senate. What happened was this - and I am very happy the Leader of the Opposition asked the question - on Friday evening, so Mr Moore-Wilton tells me, he was contacted by General Mueller and I think either General Mueller retailed what he had been told by Air Marshal Houston and Brigadier Bornholt, or perhaps Moore-Wilton spoke to one of them, but the indication was that Air Marshal Houston would be making a statement to the effect that ultimately came before the Senate yesterday. Mr Moore-Wilton reported that to me and we discussed it -  - Why wouldn't he report it to me? - Why would I report it to the Senate? I have about 101 reasons why I would not report it. To start with, I am not a member of the Senate; secondly, the Senate was not in session at a quarter past seven on Friday evening -  - and, thirdly, I have found, through the course of this and other experiences in politics, that it is a very good idea, if somebody tells you that they are going to make a statement and gives you a rough idea of what is in the statement, to wait until you actually get the statement before you act on it. That is exactly what I did on this occasion.The statement duly arrived in the office of the defence minister, I understand, yesterday. I was apprised of it before lunch. It was the view of the defence minister that the former defence minister ought to have an opportunity of responding to the statement and, in fact, he ultimately was given an opportunity of responding. I just happen to have been handed a copy of his response, which I table, Mr Speaker. It is an interesting response, and I might refer to the rest of it. At all material times I did exactly as I agreed with Mr Moore-Wilton would happen. Any suggestion that Mr Moore-Wilton has misled the Senate is ridiculous. Plainly, he was asked in relation to advice that he had received in the context of last October and last November -   -  - Nothing can alter the fact that we were told this statement of his was coming. At the time the question was asked - when was the question asked of Mr Moore-Wilton? - Monday. The statement had not arrived on Monday. -  - I will go on if you want me to, Mr Speaker. Just for completeness, I will read a sentence from Mr Reith's statement:I am certain I did not discuss Air Marshal Angus Houston's comments with the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. As honourable members will know, she has a great interest in Zimbabwe. She has already been there once as an observer and I am very pleased to say that she will be part of the Australian component of the Commonwealth observer delegation. I do not think she could get leave to head off this evening so she will be leaving tomorrow.The situation in Zimbabwe remains one of very serious concern to us: the commitments made by Zimbabwe at Abuja have not been fulfilled; draconian legislation has been passed; the Chief of the Defence Force has implied there would be a coup if the opposition won the election - and his comments have not been repudiated by the Zimbabwean government. Violence is continuing to this very day in Zimbabwe and the economy is in the most appalling state. Honourable members may be interested in reports that the World Food Program is now beginning the distribution of food into a country which traditionally is a major agricultural producer: five hundred thousand people require urgent assistance in Zimbabwe and there are rations for 100,000 people for the next two weeks. I have been to London twice recently to press -  -  - No, not actually to have a holiday in the way that the Leader of the Opposition did in France a few years ago, but to press the case for Zimbabwe's suspension -  - That is right; last year he went to Wimbledon, courtesy of Deutsche Bank during the Aston by-election. I travelled to London twice recently to press the case for Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonwealth and, in January, CMAG did not agree to Zimbabwe's suspension, despite the best efforts of Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, and me. But it did reaffirm its deep concern.As I have mentioned already, Australia will be sending observers as part of the Commonwealth observer team. Already Bill Gray, the former head of the Australian Electoral Commission, is in Zimbabwe. The member for Curtin is going and the Commonwealth secretariat have invited Senator Alan Ferguson to go as well. I understand that he is considering that with a view to going. - The member for Lingiari rightly says, `What about opposition members?' We submitted opposition members' names - the member for Swan's name, I think - to the Commonwealth Secretariat and it was a matter for them to make the choice. The point is this: we very much sympathise with what the European Union has done in withdrawing its electoral observers and imposing targeted sanctions. It is our view that if the Commonwealth Observers Group is not able to fulfil its role during this election campaign, there will be no point in Australia continuing to participate in that Observers Group. In those circumstances we would withdraw our observers and we would impose `smart' sanctions ourselves. We will wait and see how those Australian members of the Observers Group are able to get on. Even if the observers are able to fulfil their role, if they conclude that the election is little short of a sham - and there are already enormous concerns about that - this House can rest assured that we will impose smart sanctions in those circumstances. The member for Griffith says we should impose smart sanctions now. If we were to do that we would not be able to have any observers on the ground in Zimbabwe. I think that would, in turn, undermine the efficacy and capacity of the Commonwealth Observers Group. The fact is that if we were to do that, the opposition would be disturbed. The opposition parties in Zimbabwe do want the Commonwealth Observers Group to continue because, without observers, they have no chance of a free and fair election. With some observers they have some chance. So we will give it a chance. I do that without a great deal of optimism but with an enormous amount of determination that, as a country, we will do the right thing by the people of Zimbabwe.</DOC>

 - Can I take the opportunity of saying - I know it will be on behalf of everybody - that I wish Brigadier Bornholt well, and can I say in relation to all of the senior serving officers of the ADF that they have the complete confidence and support of the government. All of them have the complete confidence and support of the government. The Leader of the Opposition invites me to say whom I ask the Australian people to believe. My experience in relation to Peter Reith, and I say this quite unqualifiedly, is that I always found Peter Reith to be a man of great decency and honour. -  - I do. -  - I not only found him to be a person of decency and honour but also found him to be pretty effective. He was pretty effective in reforming the Australian waterfront -  -  - He was very effective in relation to that. -  - Can I just bring the context of this back. Here we are at the end of the week and we have just had the Senate estimates and we have just had the evidence from Air Marshal Houston, a very fine serving officer. We have also had the evidence of the senior military adviser to the government. The problem for the opposition out of the Senate estimates is this. Put aside for a moment - and it will be taken into the mix -  what Brigadier Bornholt said. I make no comment on that; I make no comment on what Air Marshal Houston said: they have given their evidence. But look for a moment at what Admiral Barrie said. The problem for the opposition is that you have the senior military adviser to the government - nothing can alter the fact; he actually uses the expression - saying, and I ask members of the opposition to listen to this: I go back to my opening statement. As the CDF, I am the principal military adviser to the government and it is my view that if you talk about Defence with a capital D, I am it. I have never accepted that finding, for the reasons I have outlined. I in fact heard Admiral Barrie last night say that he rejected the principal finding of the Powell report that, by 10 October, Defence had formed a view about the original advice. Admiral Barrie has said that he rejected the principal finding of the Powell report, but more significantly - and I repeat what I said at the beginning of question time - he said: So far as I was concerned, the original advice of the commander of the Adelaide ought to stand. And I never sought to recant that advice that I originally gave to the minister.That is pretty strong material in support of what the government has been saying on this issue. Admiral Barrie made one other very important point, and it reinforces an argument that I have been using over the last week.An opposition member - What a surprise! - Somebody interjects: `What a surprise!' What is that meant to mean? You were talking a moment ago about respect for serving officers. Are you suggesting that there is some connection between what Admiral Barrie said and the remarks that I have been making?  - Yes. You are very clever about alleged interjections from this side of the House! - Yes. I repeat: Admiral Barrie made the point that you had to distinguish between photographs and other evidence. I will read this again:But I have to say that in all I was never persuaded myself that there was compelling evidence that the initial report of the commanding officer was wrong. It was my view that the photographs were simply part of the evidentiary material. The really important aspects of this are witness statements and perceptions, and that initial report, so far as I was concerned, ought to stand.That goes right back to the very beginning of the government's position on this. We made our claims based on what we were told on that Sunday. There were no photographs on that Sunday. The photographs did not come into it until later in the piece. The original claim had nothing to do with photographs. Admiral Barrie makes the point that what is really important was the direct evidence on the spot. It was his view last night that he still has not been given compelling evidence that that original view was wrong. The opposition case falls to the ground.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the answer to the first part of the question is vaguely yes. I do remember some reference to it. I must say that I did not read the document in full. But in relation to Dr Wooldridge, can I say that I have asked for a full report on this matter from relevant departments. I want to give an assurance to the House, and most particularly to people who may be interested in, and assisted by, these programs that no less money - not one dollar nor one cent less - will be allocated to the relevant asthma and medical specialist programs as a result of the contract offered to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The government intends to support these programs in full. Also, I should inform the House that I do not rule out withdrawing the Commonwealth's offer to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. I do not intend to say anything further about this matter until I have had the benefit of getting a full report from all relevant departments.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I hope that what I am about to say will be of interest to her constituents in particular, to the constituents of the member for Cunningham and the member for Throsby and to the constituents of other honourable members in this parliament who are interested in the Australian steel industry.Let me say to the honourable member that the decision announced by the President last week was a bad decision. It was a decision that was wholly against the interests of freer and more open trade. It was a decision that drew an immediate critical response from all of the people charged with responsibility in the government. As a result of that a number of representations were made by the government and by relevant ministers, both here and in Washington. I am very pleased to say that, as a result of those representations, important understandings have now been reached with the United States administration over the weekend.I would have thought honourable members opposite would be interested to hear this because it goes to the security of the jobs of the people they represent - not only those who they represent, but those who we represent. As a result of those representations, understandings have been reached with the United States administration over the weekend which will allow Australian exports of hot rolled steel products to the United States west coast to proceed.This decision, combined with the tariff rate quota on Australian slab steel exports, should preserve about 85 per cent of Australia's steel exports to the United States. This is the result of a very strong, effective and coordinated lobbying effort - in the right manner, in the right places and with the right tone - carried on by members of my government. I might say that I cannot recall an example in the last 20 years where a US trade decision of this type has been subject to this kind of positive response. I do particularly want to thank the Minister for Trade, whose representations - particularly to the United States Commerce Secretary, Mr Don Evans - have been so effective. There remain aspects of this that are not positive. We keep all options, including World Trade Organisation options, open. We will continue to work with the United States and other steel producing nations to resolve this issue.Although the original decision was a very unsatisfactory one, I am particularly pleased with the way in which the administration has responded to the very legitimate complaints that we had to make as a result of this decision. Compared with the inability of earlier governments to roll back United States decisions, I regard this as a particularly satisfactory outcome if it comes to full fruition. I want to thank the trade minister, and I also want to thank and compliment the Australian Ambassador to the United States, Mr Michael Thorley, for the work that he has done. I would also like to record my appreciation for the constructive approach adopted by the United States Ambassador in Canberra, Mr Tom Schieffer. </DOC>

A quick check, done this morning - and I say that it was a quick check, in the time available - would suggest that this recollection is correct. But part of getting a full report from departments is establishing who knew what, and when. When I have the result of that I will be very happy to take further questions, and the member for Perth will not be held in terrorum.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I recognise the interest that he shows in this issue. I think that all Australians will have been struck this week by the appalling scenes of violence that we have seen on our television screens from the Middle East. In that period of a week, over 110 people have perished. There is no justification at all for these acts of terror, and the perpetrators of these acts of terror must be brought to justice. The level of violence that is taking place now is threatening to take the Middle East situation over the precipice into something at least akin to war.The Australian government urges the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to reassess their present course and bring to an end the killing. There is no military solution to the problems of the Middle East. The Mitchell recommendations and the Tenet security work plan are widely accepted as providing a path back to negotiation and the two parties - the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders - should move to try to implement the recommendations of the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report.I am pleased that the United States administration now has decided that the time is right to increase its engagement. Visits by President Bush's envoy, General Zinny, and Vice-President Cheney as well, indicate the American determination to do what they can - limited as their capacity might be in certain ways - to reign in the violence. At the end of last week I went out of my way to encourage the Americans to become more involved in trying to achieve at least a return to some stability in the Middle East. Next week I will meet with the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council who will be visiting and it will be an opportunity for me and others in the House to discuss the issue directly with the Palestinian leadership.Australia has consistently expressed support for efforts to build peace in the region. Let me remind the House that we remain strongly committed to the territorial integrity of Israel and the right of the people of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries. We also recognise the proper right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. We expect a comprehensive, just and durable resolution of the region's conflict and that it will necessarily meet the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians for a homeland of their own in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 242. </DOC>

 - As it happens, my attention has been drawn to some comments and those comments have been made by a successful Labor leader, the Premier of Queensland. He had some very interesting things to say last week about the link between education funding and the goods and services tax. And may I say that it will not be the last that the other Labor premiers of Australia have heard about that linkage. They will hear a lot more about that linkage from me and from other members of the federal government over the course of the next 12 months.What the Premier of Queensland did last week when he announced a massive increase in education spending in the state of Queensland was finally admit that the Labor Party has been running a great lie about the goods and services tax ever since it was introduced. That is what the Premier of Queensland did. When I heard the Premier of Queensland, I was put in mind of some Labor Party advertisements in the last election campaign and they belonged to the `very smart' category of Labor Party advertisements - they quoted my words. It was one of those advertisements that took a comment I made in the great debate. The member for Brand will remember -  - He remembers it very well and I am glad that he does. The worm on Channel 9 remembers it very well, too. I said that the best thing that we have done for education and health in recent times was to introduce a GST. The Labor Party said, `You beaut! Howard's blown it again.' And they grabbed hold of it and they ran an advertisement and they said, `This is ridiculous. This is not a plan. This is a new tax. This is outrageous. This will cost him the election.' And they went out there and they said, `The GST is bad for your health. The GST is bad for education.'Now the election is over and Labor premiers around the country are facing the reality of their responsibilities. What are they doing? They are owning up and they are starting with the Premier of Queensland. The Premier of Queensland knows that from 1 July next year his will be the first state in Australia that is better off as a result of the introduction of the GST. He knows that those rivers of GST gold will flow from the Commonwealth in ever greater quantities from 1 July next year. The difference between the Premier of Queensland and all of the others is that he has been the first to own up. When the next Premiers Conference gathers together, I am going to apply the Beattie truth test to all of the other premiers of the Australian states. I am going to remind the Premier of New South Wales - who likes to talk about education and who likes to demonstrate his knowledge of American, Australian and all forms of other history - of what the Premier of Queensland had to say. And every time he complains to me about funding of education, I am going to say to the Premier of New South Wales, `You just listen to what the Premier of Queensland said.' The Premier of Queensland said: Today the government's commitment to invest the lion's share of GST growth funds - `growth funds', he said - in education was a clear statement of its determination to make Queensland the `smart state'.Listen to this:The growth funding returning to the state - this could have been my friend the Treasurer. When I read those words I thought, `Good on you, Peter, you are really selling the benefits of the GST.' Then I realised it was not Peter Costello; it was our friend Peter Beattie, who stated:The growth funding returning to the state government as a result of the GST will be largely invested in the education of our children and young people. Now we are planning to invest our growth funding in education.In other words, what Peter Beattie was saying is what has always been the case: that the great long-term beneficiaries of tax reform in this country are the people who receive the services provided by the Australian states. If you want to improve government schools, police services, roads and hospitals, what you need is tax reform. What you needed was a courageous federal government that had the courage to introduce tax reform, and what you did not need was a negative, dishonest, carping opposition that tried to feed back electorally on what it thought was the short-term disadvantage of the introduction of tax reform. Peter Beattie has blown the whistle on that deception. Peter Beattie has been honest enough to recognise what we all know to be the case: that the GST is good for state education funding; that the GST will guarantee in the years ahead rising revenues for state government services; and that it therefore represents one of the great historic revenue sharing reforms in the 100 years of the Australian Federation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that during the December quarter of 2001 the Australian economy grew by 1.3 per cent to record 4.1 per cent growth through the year in 2001. I am sure that all Australians and both sides of this House will welcome the fact that the Australian economy proved to be the strongest growing economy in the industrialised world in the course of 2001. In fact, the figures show that it was broadly based in the economy with household consumption increasing 1.3 per cent in the December quarter, with the first home owners grant and lower mortgage interest rates leading a very solid 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling investment. Business investment increased by 2.9 per cent for the second quarter in a row. The profit margins of companies also increased by 5.8 per cent. A 4.1 per cent growth rate would be remarkable at any time, but this was a 4.1 per cent growth rate in the year in which the US economy was in recession, Japan was in recession, Germany was in recession, Singapore was in recession and Taiwan was in recession. There was a synchronised global downturn in the three major centres of world activity: in Europe, in Japan and in the United States. Yet Australia continued to grow. The growth rate of 4.1 per cent in the Australian economy in the calendar year 2001 was 10 times the OECD average. I am sure both sides of the House will welcome those very strong national accounts - 10 times the OECD average and 10 times the average of the industrialised nations. It was not everybody in Australia who had confidence in the Australian economy in 2001. Members of this House will remember that Her Majesty's loyal opposition took great delight through the course of 2001 in making their economic prognostications. For example, on 4 April 2001 Simon Crean stated:... the GST has king hit the ... economy.This is a year in which the economy grew at 4.1 per cent. The amazing thing about the Australian GST is that it managed to put Japan into recession, the US into recession, Germany into recession and Australia into booming economic times. He said on 8 March:... we know the GST has already king hit investment - which was up in the December quarter - It's king hit consumer demand - which was up in the December quarter - and we've still got to await the impact of the international economy ...We remember the current member for Brand going down to the Aston by-election a hopin' and a wishin' and a thinkin' and a prayin' that there would be a negative quarter and he could proclaim a recession. That was when he went down in July to Aston and said that Europe was fine, America was fine and the only country which could be facing recession would be Australia. And to his great regret Australia continued to grow, and grow at 4.1 per cent. I think that, as the Prime Minister said, not only has tax reform delivered to the states increasing revenues - and we will be having a meeting with all of the state treasurers on Friday week, I think, where they will all come to Canberra to demand their share of GST -  - I am going to ask if any of them are still interested in roll-back! Any Treasurer that is interested in roll-back will be delivered a roll-back policy on Friday week, especially if it is the treasurer of Tasmania - a good man who really loves his GST!Not only that: we came through a year when Australia turned stronger whilst the world turned down. For the tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians whose jobs were saved as a result of the Australian economy continuing to be strong in 2001, this was good news - welcomed, I believe, by all Australians. I pay tribute to the businesses of Australia, to the optimism of the Australian consumer, and I hope that the continued economic growth of Australia for the benefit of all Australians will continue through this current year.</DOC>

 - I have already answered this question at a national press conference, Mr Speaker, and put out a statement. I notice that, notwithstanding that I have put out a statement, done a press conference in front of the press and answered the question, the shadow Treasurer keeps on asking the same question. I have gone through it in great detail. The policy of foreign currency swaps, which was started by the Labor Party in 1989 and practised under all treasurers and treasury secretaries until then, had a benchmark, which was under Treasury Secretary Evans. In October, Treasury Secretary Evans gave authorisation for the breaching of that benchmark. On 9 November the matter was drawn to my attention. I discussed it with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury, and I believe it was on 6 December that the benchmark was suspended. After that, at my instigation, a report was commissioned on whether or not the policy should be continued at all. My view was that it was something that should be reviewed in its entirety. That report came out in June 2001, recommending that the policy not be continued. That was accepted by me in September 2001 and the policy was ended accordingly. As I have said in my press releases and I have said on a number of occasions, this matter was first brought to my attention on 9 November. As I have said on numbers of occasions - in press conferences, in statements - on 9 November this matter -  - No, it was on 9 November. I will say it, I think for the sixth or seventh time. An opposition member - You know nothing. - No, on 9 November I was alerted. I was alerted on 9 November. I think I have now said it eight or nine times. It was after that that I discussed it with both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and on 6 December at a meeting between the three of us, the decision was made, at the request of the governor of the bank, to suspend the benchmark.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson, who represents the biggest part of one of Australia's most important industries - the sugar industry - and a whole range of other agricultural producers. Just a few moments ago the Treasurer spoke about Australia's remarkable economic performance over recent times. Against a background of recession around the world, Australia has continued to make economic advances, and in the rural sector there has been a magnificent contribution towards our nation's economic growth. At the Outlook Conference last week, ABARE was able to report that there have been 10 per cent increases in farm output for the last two successive years, and it is estimated that in 2001-02 there will be a 10 per cent overall increase on top of the 10 per cent the previous year which has boosted the livelihoods of so many rural and regional communities around Australia.We have also, from the farm sector, significantly underpinned our nation's improved trade performance. Our rural exports have made a real difference to Australia. Whilst this government is very encouraged by the farm sector's recent performance, we certainly cannot be complacent. There are elements of the forecasts for the year ahead which demonstrate some degree of softness in commodity prices, including, unfortunately, in the sugar industry, where massive production in some other parts of the world and a corrupt world market are leading to concerns about potential prices in that commodity.But Australian farmers know that their position is substantially improved as a result of the low inflation, low interest and low tax policy of this government. That is something they did not experience under the previous 13 years of Labor. It is bad enough if your commodity prices are low but if you are experiencing high taxes, high inflation and high interest rates - as Labor delivered for 13 years - then your economic situation is indeed in a great deal of trouble. While this government is in office, I believe we can guarantee that there will be a continuation of policies of low interest rates and low inflation and that there will be a continuation of support for rural industries that face difficulties. However, it is important that farmers also take advantage of the better times to put aside for those inevitable commodity cycles when prices deteriorate. Farm management deposits, which had been destroyed by Labor in their term in office and have now been restored, are an excellent vehicle for farmers to put aside in their good times so that they can be self-reliant in more difficult times. I am pleased to report to the House that farmers have responded wholeheartedly to the new farm management deposit arrangements. There is now more than $1 billion deposited by farmers in the Farm Management Deposit Scheme. That is something they have been able to do because of the good economic management of this government and because there is a useful scheme that has been able to give them an opportunity to put aside in these times. It will help them through the more difficult times and help them through softer commodity prices, but through all this what they need most of all is a government that cares about their economic circumstances and that will provide the kind of economic environment to make farming prosperous in Australia.</DOC>

 - The report of 1996 actually recommended the entering into of the currency swaps. - Oh, big problem? What is your point? Did you refer to the reports? The reports actually recommended that the policy be continued. - Yes. I have gone through this in my press release. Let me read it out to you. It would be interesting if you read it. - We can go back further. - I know that you do not like the answer but it would be worth listening to it. - With the Loans Securities Amendment Bill 1988, Treasurer Keating amended legislation to authorise himself to enter into swap transactions. In the explanatory memorandum, which I can table at the end of question time, he said:The new section 5d expands existing arrangements for the Treasurer to delegate his powers regarding overseas borrowings, swaps -  - He continued:... and other financial agreements or arrangements to officials.He then said:In seeking Executive Council authority for the Government to undertake overseas loans and swap agreements, under the terms and conditions of borrowings or swaps, which the Treasurer is authorised to determine, it has been customary for the Governor-General to give approval.But the amendments, as he said in paragraph (7), will bring the Commonwealth's ability to issue short-term debt overseas in line with the issue of Treasury notes in Australia. I will table that document in its entirety, Mr Speaker. The power to enter into swaps was sought by Paul Keating as Treasurer, and that was passed by this parliament. The policy of entering into swaps continued under five treasurers, four Treasury secretaries and three Reserve Bank governors. It was recommended by JP Morgan in 1989, it was recommended by BT, Carmichael Consulting and Coopers and Lybrand, and it was recommended by UBS Warburg. That was all set out in my press release -  - You want the dates? I can give you the dates - it is all in the press release: JP Morgan in 1989; Union Bank of Switzerland in 1996; BT, Carmichael Consulting and Coopers and Lybrand in 1997; and UBS Warburg and Dillon Read in 1998.I should also point out that various people appeared before the Senate to justify this policy. I have never actually appeared before the Senate to justify this policy but someone in this House has - someone in this House actually went into Senate estimates to justify the policy. It was in April 1992. Who should appear but the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer! He appeared before Senate estimates to justify the policy of entering into currency swaps - a fact which he has hitherto failed to disclose to the press. I should in fairness read out his justification. Senator Watson asked:Could the Parliamentary Secretary comment on the monitoring process in relation to the swap interest regime conducted by Treasury? Senator McMullan responded:I hope somebody else can.And he sat there while the Treasury officials justified the policy. So here we have a policy which was entered into by the Labor Party and which has been conducted under five treasurers, four Treasury secretaries and three Reserve Bank governors. The benchmark was a 15 per cent portfolio currency swap. The reason why large sums became involved was not just that the Labor Party initiated the policy but that the Labor Party ran up the debt portfolio to which it applied. As I have said previously, if there had been no Commonwealth government securities on issue, 15 per cent being held in foreign currency would have amounted to nothing. But when the Commonwealth government securities on issue were run up to $96 billion, a policy of 15 per cent of $96 billion amounted to a very large sum.I noticed that Senator Conroy, one of the Labor Party people who pretends to be an expert on this, was asked, `Wasn't this Labor Party debt that was held in swaps?' He said, `Well, no. It was the debt which has been run up by the Commonwealth since Federation.' And he was right, except that the debt which was run up by the Commonwealth since Federation stood at $16 billion in 1990 and five years later stood at $96 billion. So for 90 years worth, we got to $16 billion and in another five we got another $80 billion. As I said, the policy was set up by the Labor Party, the debt was run up by the Labor Party and the policy was justified by Mr McMullan. Another point that he has failed to disclose to the press is that, whilst he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, he himself presided over the issue of $2.2 billion in currency swaps, some of which we are still managing.As I said earlier, the policy was recommended by JP Morgan, reviewed and re-endorsed by the Union Bank of Switzerland; reviewed and re-endorsed by BT, Carmichael Consulting, and Coopers and Lybrand; and reviewed again and re-endorsed by UBS Warburg and Dillon Read. The only Treasurer to my knowledge who has wound down the swaps program was me. I am afraid to say that it was started by PJ Keating, it was run by Ralph Willis, John Kerin, John Dawkins, Ralph Willis again and continued by me until it was wound down as the result of a decision I took on 6 December 2000, suspending the benchmark, ordering a review and closing the program. I was asked about those reviews. Those reviews all recommended the continuation of the program. If I may say so, your complaint ought to be that we followed them, not that we ignored them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. This government has great faith in the commonsense and decency of the Australian worker, which is so often at odds with the attitudes of union officials and the leaders of the Australian Labor Party. The House might recall a recent survey of Australian workers that showed that no fewer than 83 per cent supported the government's policy on border protection. The same survey showed that fewer than 50 per cent of Australian workers thought that their union was doing a good or a very good job. This is little wonder, because far too many union officials are more interested in union power than they are in the real rights of Australian workers.The unions' latest campaign is to make it federal and state Labor policy to force workers to pay compulsory levies to unions if they are not members of those unions. In the last fortnight, the Queensland Secretary of the Australian Services Union described workers who were not union members as freeloaders. He said, `They are freeloaders who should not be tolerated by Labor governments.' This gentleman may well be, to the general public, just another one of the faceless men who control the Labor Party -  - He is obviously very well known to members opposite, because 16 members opposite are affiliated with the Australian Services Union. The members for Chisholm, Holt, Lalor, Bruce, Werriwa, Capricornia, Stirling, Cunningham, Burke, Chifley, Gellibrand and Melbourne -  - Well, you have misled the register of members' interests. - That shows that those members plus Senators Collins, Schacht, West and Conroy are all members or former members of the Australian Services Union. But there is hope that the notorious 60-40 rule will one day be broken. In today's Daily Telegraph it was reported that the Leader of the Opposition had had a secret meeting with senior figures of the New South Wales Labor Party. There he revealed his 1,000-day deadline for reforming the Australian Labor Party. President Franklin D Roosevelt had a 100-day deadline for kick-starting the American economy out of the Great Depression, and the member for Hotham has given himself 1,000 days to reform the Australian Labor Party. Glaciers in winter move faster than the Leader of the Opposition. The oceans are rising faster than the Leader of the Opposition is acting.Mr Speaker, 1,000 days from now takes the Leader of the Opposition to the middle of December 2004, so his plan for reforming the Labor Party will come out just in time to be shelved before the next election. Time and tide will not wait for the Leader of the Opposition's deadline. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, the government's Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 comes before the Senate this week, so the real deadline for the Leader of the Opposition to prove he has changed - to prove he can be his own man and not just a union heavy - is actually three days.</DOC>

 - Can I come to the ANAO, because, again, the member for Fraser has been wilfully misleading the public on the issue.  - No; he has been wilfully misleading the public, Mr Speaker, in his press comment. The Australian National Audit Office report of October 1999 did not recommend abandoning the benchmark. It is all there on the public record, and what it said was that, when the next review was done, for the first time they should refer to the Treasurer the benchmark - the implication being that it had never been referred to the Treasurer. It is all there on the public record. In fact, it was referred to the Treasurer before they finished their next review; it was referred to the Treasurer at the instigation of the Reserve Bank Governor. It was the Reserve Bank Governor who raised this with the Treasury secretary, who waived the benchmark in October, who notified the Treasurer on 9 November, who discussed it in a preliminary way thereafter with the governor of the bank and who had another meeting with the governor of the bank on 6 December and suspended it. It was able to be suspended at that point because there were no or very few new swaps being entered into. I believe that swaps actually ceased being entered into for any substantive reason back in February 1999. - The swaps that the Commonwealth is managing are the Labor Party's debt -  - introduced under a Labor Party policy, with legislation passed by a Labor Party Treasurer -  - and conducted under five treasurers - four Labor and one coalition - four Treasury secretaries and three Reserve Bank governors, two of whom were appointed, I believe, by the Labor Party. It was ended by this government, first with the suspension on 6 December 2000 and, after a review, formally ended in September 2001. However, at the end of all that, what are the facts? The facts are these: Commonwealth government debt stood at $96 billion when the Labor Party left office, and we have repaid $57 billion worth of Labor Party debt. In all of the figures that I hear about, I never hear any reference to the $57 billion worth of Labor Party debt that has now been repaid; nor does the member for Fraser ever concede that the debt that we are managing is Labor Party debt.This government have not issued any new debt since they were elected. The whole argument is: how do we manage Labor's debt and how do we repay it? We have managed $96 billion down to $39 billion, which only puts us $57 billion in front of the Australian Labor Party. We believe there is more work to be done. We would like to get it back to where it was before the Labor Party began the damage to Australia in 1990. If we continue our good economic management, I hope we will be able to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and, indeed, for his strong advocacy not only on behalf of Corangamite but also on behalf of the Christian College Institute of Senior Education in his electorate. The Howard government believes very strongly in a quality education for all Australian students and also in the right of parents to choose the kind of school that is best to meet the aspirational and educational needs of their own children. In fact, since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has increased funding to government schools by 46 per cent in a period when enrolments in government schools increased by 1.4 per cent. The interesting thing here is that state governments, which are responsible primarily for state government schools, increased their funding to their schools last year by 2.7 per cent, on average; whereas, the Commonwealth increased its funding by 5.6 per cent. One of the important measures introduced by this government to assist parents to make choices is to base the funding of non-government schools on the educational, occupational and income status of families, and also to provide establishment grants or start-up assistance for small non-government schools that are trying to get going. I was asked about other policies. The Labor Party still has a policy of denying these schools their funding. In fact, some of the poorest schools in this country are awaiting those grants, because the Australian Labor Party has twice refused to pass the bill and only two weeks ago foreshadowed potentially obstructive amendments in this House. This is causing significant hardship and grief in these school communities, and many members in this place know this to be true. There are 58 schools awaiting these critically important funds. - Those 58 schools are represented by 46 honourable members in this place. - In fact, I know my office has had considerable representations from a number of members' offices - for example, the member for Kalgoorlie has phoned me directly three times on behalf of the Nyikina Mangala Aboriginal Community School in Derby.I have also had the member for Barker contact me on behalf of three schools in his electorate: the Glendale College, the Murray Bridge Christian College and the Encounter Lutheran Primary School. You will be surprised to hear this, Prime Minister, but the new member for Dickson is now a strong advocate of the Living Faith Primary School, which is waiting for $24,000 in establishment grants. It would be wrong to let honourable members feel that the only members in this place advocating on behalf of these struggling new schools are confined to this side of the House. Two weeks ago I had representations on behalf of the Chabad Jewish Day School and very strong and very effective representations from the local member's office. In fact Ben, from Bentleigh, rang twice. He was quite diligent to make sure that we understood the needs of the 34 students and the families of the Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School. So concerned was he to see that we got the facts, he actually sent me the details of the establishment grants that have been paid to the school, and it correctly points out that the school, whilst having been paid $6,000 in establishment grants, is still waiting for another $6,000. The reason why the Chabad Jewish Day School needs its federal member's office to phone me to get the school the money is that the federal member concerned is a member of the Australian Labor Party which is opposed to these schools getting their start-up grants. It is rather interesting that the foreshadowed amendments by the Australian Labor Party will actually reduce the amount of money that will go to this particular school. Who would be a member who would represent a school such as this that is struggling and have a member of his staff contact me directly to get the funding? Who could that be? It is the member for Hotham. I ask the member for Hotham, if he has any influence in the Australian Labor Party and consistent with the excellent representation by Ben from Bentleigh in his office, to get this legislation passed in the Senate - and I hope it does not take 1,000 days. It is hypocrisy, on the one hand, to go out to local communities and tell 58 struggling new non-government schools that you are going to come here and argue for their funds and then, on the other hand, to come to the federal parliament and not support this legislation. There are 4,900 families involved here and some of them come from the most educationally impoverished communities in the country. I say to the member for Hotham: do not pass this legislation for the government's sake, do not pass it for my sake or even for the member for Hotham's sake; pass it for the sake of 4,900 kids and their families, who are some of the poorest in the country, and pass it immediately. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for the question. Since the horrific events of September 11, the Howard government has moved swiftly to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities. There was a high level review of Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements instigated after the terrorist attacks in the United States. The government announced in October last year it would introduce a series of measures designed to strengthen the counter-terrorism legislative framework. A general offence of terrorism will be created, along with an offence relating to preparation for or planning terrorist attacks. The funding of terrorist activities will also be explicitly criminalised and existing treason offences will be modernised to reflect the realities of the modern conflict. The government will also act to implement the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and we will increase our national security by introducing further measures to protect our borders.In October last year the Prime Minister announced our intention to introduce new antihoax laws. The antihoax laws were introduced during the first sitting week of the year and have already passed this House. These laws are designed to ensure that those who seek to create public fear and alarm by sending hoax material or dangerous substances are properly penalised. The government are also considering a range of options to enhance our counter-terrorism arrangements under our national antiterrorism plan. We have made an election commitment to develop a new national framework to fight transnational crime and terrorism. The Prime Minister has invited state and territory leaders to a summit to discuss the twin problems of transnational crime and terrorism, and Australia's ability to respond at a national level to these issues. It is vital that Australia's criminal justice and law enforcement agencies are able to deal effectively with contemporary threats of serious and organised crime. As part of the process of ensuring that we have the best systems in place to combat transnational crime and terrorism, we are reviewing the operation of the National Crime Authority. On this point, I should note that, contrary to reports in the media, the government does not plan to merge the Australian Federal Police and the NCA. No country has ever been immune to the threat of terrorism. While there is no specific threat of terrorism in Australia at present, we must ensure that we are as well prepared as possible to deal with the new international security environment. I believe that the government has taken very positive steps to ensure that we are. While I am on my feet, I take the opportunity to commend the Commonwealth agencies involved in the national security arrangements for CHOGM. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Australian Defence Force, my own department -  particularly through the PSCC - ASIO, the AFP and a number of other departments and agencies cooperated extremely well. I would also like to commend in particular the Queensland Police Service for the work done by them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question and obvious interest in his constituents in his electorate who are engaged in the steel industry. Our government have been actively engaged - as was outlined by the Prime Minister in his earlier response - with the Bush administration, pursuing an outcome that will secure the future of the Australian steel industry and exports to the United States. That in large part has been achieved. For the member's constituents, whom he is concerned about, it ensures their jobs for the future. I understand that particular plant produces a significant amount of the hot rolled product for which we have been lobbying on behalf of the Australian industry.Well may the member ask: what is happening in the future? We will be engaging with the steel industry over the next week to look at the remaining elements of this decision, in terms of the cold rolled product and other products in that small 15 per cent area of our exports that are still going to be subject to some impediments in getting into the US marketplace. We will continue to work with the industry, as we have over the last six months. It has been interesting to note the absence until last week of any advocacy by the union movement involved in purportedly representing the steelworkers of Australia. Last week, we saw a media release put out by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union.  -  - Yes, Dougie Cameron. Dougie Cameron said:We are very concerned about the impact of this move for our members in Port Kembla and the Australian steel industry. Generally we call on the government to act on their behalf immediately.We have, but we know the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the ACTU have not. They were absent from the field for the last six months while our government -  and the industry - has been advocating the case with the US administration on behalf of Australian steelworkers. -  - They have been absent from the field. In fact, in 1999, at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle, where was Doug Cameron? Doug Cameron was on the streets of Seattle, marching with the AFL-CIO and the steelworkers. He has been in bed with the steelworkers in America, who have forced this decision. The steelworkers in America - the ACTU colleagues in America - have forced this decision in America. Far from acting on behalf of the steelworkers of Australia, he has been in bed with the steelworkers in America, who have been trying to cost Australian steelworkers their jobs. When Doug Cameron suggests that the government should act on behalf of the steelworkers immediately, we have. We have achieved an outcome and we know that for the last six months he has been absent from the field.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for his question. It gives me an opportunity, in the calmness of the remaining minutes of question time, to further expand. I know that there are many men and women in the Australian steel industry, in and around Port Kembla and in other parts of Australia, who will be very interested in the answer and who will be interested to know what their government and their representatives have been trying to do in good faith since this issue was raised.I point out to the honourable member for Cunningham that the originally announced decision by the United States President did exclude slab steel, which represents close to 50 per cent of BHP exports to the United States. It is my understanding that the original decision was not as draconian as the recommendation made by the Federal Trade Commission. That was in part - not entirely, but in part - due to representations we had already made. The representations that have been made on this issue are not representations that have been made simply as a result of the announcement made by the President. There were many representations made by me, by the Minister for Trade and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs long before the decision was announced by the President. It is true that 85 per cent is not 100 per cent, but 85 per cent is 35 per cent better than 50 per cent, and 85 per cent is an infinitely better outcome than -  - If you go back over all the difficult trade decisions that have been taken, adverse to the interests of this country, by the United States over the last 15 or 20 years, I cannot offhand recall one where, as a result of representations made by the government in power, the roll-back by the United States has been as great as it has been on this occasion. The measure of the success that we have had in relation to this is a comparison with what has happened on earlier occasions. The decision taken by the United States administration was a bad decision. It was a domestically based political decision. It was designed to suit the interests of the steelworkers of the United States, and that is why I went into bat for the steelworkers of Australia. As a result of what we have done -   -  - It might grieve the member for Cunningham that we have had a bit of success, but he ought to recognise that we have had success and he ought to recognise that this government, as a result of the combined efforts of our ambassador in the United States and my ministerial colleagues, has been able to win a very significant additional concession from the United States administration. The member for Cunningham shakes his head. I will be very happy to go and talk to the steelworkers of his electorate -  - I will talk to the steelworkers of Australia. I know he may not want me to speak to them because it may not suit the interests of the member for Cunningham to acknowledge that a coalition government has been more successful in rolling back an adverse American trade decision than were the Hawke or Keating governments -  - The Hawke and Keating governments constantly engaged in rhetoric on these matters but their success rate was infinitely less than -  - the success rate of this government. Can I just say again to the honourable member for Cunningham, who, incidentally, mentioned the lamb decision - and remind him - that we took that to the World Trade Organisation and we won. As a result of the success that we had in that, I think that to have been able to achieve the additional success in the few days that have gone by since this announcement is a great tribute to the negotiating skills of this government and its representative. Instead of the member for Cunningham and the Leader of the Opposition engaging in petty bipartisan opposition on this issue, they ought -  - Partisan opposition. They ought to be joining the government in welcoming the fact that the American administration has responded to the representations of a close friend and a close ally and see this as a decision that has been taken in the interests of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I know how dedicated he is to the protection of the wonderful natural heritage on the Great Barrier Reef and how proud he is of the very powerful legislation that this government has put in place, that the Labor Party opposed, which gives the reef much greater protection than it has ever had before. Mr Speaker, I am aware of -  - I am aware of suggestions that I should act illegally by setting aside the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The person who is making that request for illegal action is none other than the member for Wills, the shadow minister for the environment. Senator Nick Bolkus, the previous shadow minister for the environment, knew nothing about it, but at least he had the commonsense to say nothing about it. The new shadow minister knows nothing about it but constantly puts on the public record foolish, inaccurate and in this case quite unjustified statements. On the weekend we heard an amazing recommendation from the member for Wills that I should arbitrarily ignore the EPBC Act in relation to an application to explore an area of the seabed off Townsville because it is too close to the reef. I quote the member for Wills's press release, which says:I have no doubt at all that all it would take is one public statement from the Howard Government that oil drilling will not be allowed in the Townsville Trough and the company would go away.Far from making the company go away, such a statement from me would give the company grounds for legal appeal against any ruling that I might make on their application because, as the member for Wills ought to know, process has to be followed. The act lays down a very clear and specific process, which is being followed by this government, and I am not going to put the government in a position where it cannot adequately protect the World Heritage values of the reef. The shadow minister goes even further and on the ABC on Saturday, in relation to mining on the reef, he said:If the government is serious about protecting the reef it will commit to banning that kind of exploration and that kind of seismic activity.Kelvin, that is very kind of you, but mining on the reef has been banned for almost the last 30 years. - Let us go through the situation so that those opposite can understand. There will be no drilling for oil and gas on the reef; there will be no drilling in the World Heritage area; and there will be no exploration allowed outside the reef if it damages the World Heritage area and its endangered or its migratory species. Now that they have heard this, I hope the members opposite, including the member for Wills, can comprehend it.</DOC>

 - The government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook disclosed on page 31 a decision by the government for the co-location of national general practice organisations, including GP House. It also showed that the costs of that would be met from within the agency's existing resourcing, which was the decision that had been made by the relevant minister. As was said yesterday, the Prime Minister has called for a full report on this matter from the relevant departments and given an assurance that no less money will be allocated to the relevant asthma and medical specialist programs as a result of the contract offered to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The government intends to support these programs in full. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, he has not ruled out withdrawing the Commonwealth's offer in relation to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, and certainly I can speak from my own point of view: I would be very interested to get the legal advice on what the Commonwealth's legal obligations in relation to that are. There it is: it is disclosed on page 31 of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. I just cannot resist pointing out that it would never have been disclosed under the Labor Party's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, because there wasn't one. There never was one. In addition, can I also say that they never actually released a table of measures, so if it had not been for this government introducing measures and introducing the mid-year review, it would not have been there. Sorry, but it has been there since before the election - since October 2001. There it is on page 31.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and take the opportunity to remind the House of the excellent job he did as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I think that many Australians have a great interest in the events unfolding in Zimbabwe, in the Zimbabwe presidential election which has taken place over the last three days. It is worth recalling that it was the Australian government of Malcolm Fraser and in particular Mr Fraser himself who played such a significant role not only in helping to establish the modern Zimbabwe constitution but in working with President Mugabe in the early years of President Mugabe's prime ministership. Therefore, for that reason and also for many other reasons including historical reasons, we follow very closely in this country events in Zimbabwe. I can inform the House that the polls have now closed in Zimbabwe's presidential election. Booths were to have closed on Sunday evening, but given the very lengthy queues outside the polling booths, Zimbabwe's High Court quite rightly ordered that they remain open on Monday. Still, notwithstanding the extra time given to voters, particularly in the Harare urban area, our High Commission in Harare assesses that some Zimbabweans have been denied the opportunity to vote. Counting of the vote is expected to commence during the course of today. All votes must be counted in an honest and honourable way. Commonwealth observers will monitor the count along with other teams of observers, including personnel from our own High Commission. I remind the House that two members of this House, the members for Curtin and for Griffith, are amongst the Commonwealth observer team. There are in total four Australian observers, the others being Senator Alan Ferguson and a former head of the Australian Electoral Commission. I cannot say whether the outcome of this historic election will reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe, though it would appear the lead-up to the election has been neither free nor fair. I look forward to receipt of the report of the Commonwealth Observers Group. This report is crucial to any subsequent Commonwealth action that may be decided by President Mbeki of South Africa, President Obasanjo of Nigeria and our own Prime Minister, in accordance with the Harare declaration and the Millbrook action program. Measures that may be decided by the troika of leaders as mandated by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting range from collective disapproval to suspension.Finally, I have received today a report that the Secretary-General of the opposition party, which is called the Movement for Democratic Change, and another senior official of the MDC have been arrested on unspecified charges. I have instructed our High Commission in Zimbabwe to make urgent inquiries about these latest arrests. We look forward in a very short period of time to hearing the results of the election. We look forward to getting the report of the Commonwealth Observers Group. Then we will be able to make more fulsome judgments about this election.</DOC>

 - By the standards of the Australian Labor Party that is an extraordinary piece of misrepresentation of what I said yesterday. What I said yesterday was that I had not been informed, from recollection, at the time the original decision was taken. The original decision was taken by the former health minister and the former minister for finance. I know you are struggling on this issue, but really! You will have to do a lot better than this. The member for Brand was much better at these things. The member for Brand would have asked a far better question than that. The member for Brand was not too bad at these sorts of questions. I am almost nostalgic about the member for Brand already. Isn't it interesting?Seriously, what I said yesterday was that, from recollection, I had not been informed of the decision at the time it was taken. It was taken, so I understand, around 27 or 28 September. Subsequently, it was referred to, as the Treasurer has indicated - contrary to what was claimed by the opposition yesterday - in the midyear economic review. In those circumstances, any suggestion that I have misled the House or misled the Australian people is not only untrue but even contemptible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. I thank him for the interest that he shows in the new taxation system. The new tax system which was introduced by this government has placed the Australian Taxation Office in a better position than ever before to deal with the black economy. More than 3.9 million Australian business numbers have now been registered, after an original estimate of 2.1 million, which is pretty amazing, and more than 2.1 million businesses are registered for GST when our original estimate was 1.4 million. The system of the Australian business number, as you know, allows the Australian Taxation Office to trace credits and liabilities in relation to GST and it also gives the Australian Taxation Office the ability to crosscheck against income and company tax.The Australian National Audit Office has recently conducted a performance audit on the Australian Taxation Office's progress in addressing the cash economy. The results are very positive. The audit concluded that the tax office has substantially implemented the recommendations of 1998 and that there has been substantial compliance achieved against the black economy. With the policy document released by the government in 1998, the tax commissioner estimated that the impact of the new tax system measures would result in a compliance dividend of $3.5 billion over three years, and of this the largest component would be $2.6 billion in additional income tax in 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03. The Auditor-General's finding was that:ATO projections, based on revenue to date, show that expectations have been exceeded.That is, the Australian National Audit Office says that the tax office expectations of picking up the cash economy have not only materialised but been exceeded. I think both sides of this House would welcome that.But there is only one side of this House that actually supported the measures to clamp down on the cash economy, and that was the coalition. The Australian Labor Party opposed the new tax system root and branch and, in doing so, opposed measures to clamp down on the black economy. Let us bear in mind the finding of the ANAO: that the commissioner's expectations have been exceeded. We can recall in this House prognostications from learned people telling us that the GST would never clamp down on the black economy. Who do you think might have made those prognostications? Old Ben from Bentleigh. This is the finding of the ANAO and this is what he said in this parliament on 28 June 2001:... far from shutting down the black economy, your GST has encouraged a massive growth in the black economy ...The thing that amazes me about the Labor Party is they will get in here and they will analyse the semantics of sentences to see whether there was a misleading word or a misleading verb or a misleading adjective or whether a date was wrong on 7 November or 8 October. But let us come to the point about who engages in the grossest misrepresentations in this House: none other than the man they have decided to make their leader - a man who was saying in June 2001 that the black economy was growing. He said this:Rather than celebrating the GST crackdown on tax avoidance and the black economy, they are flourishing ...Not only do we have the Australian Taxation Office, which has now predicted a dividend; we now have a finding from the ANAO that that has been met, if not exceeded. From this side of the House, we believe that people who do not pay their fair share should so that decent, hardworking, honest Australians can have lower taxes. That is what we believe in, and we only wish that the Australian Labor Party did too.</DOC>

 - I certainly do remember the health policy that we released. As to the quotation from it, like all quotations that are put to me from the opposite side, I always like to check them before I accept them. I have not had experience of the member for Chisholm having misrepresented anything to me in the past, but unfortunately some of those in her party who sit closer to me have -  - The former member for Flinders was never a member of the Australian Labor Party - never. The former member for Flinders inflicted a lot of damage on the Australian Labor Party, and that is why those who sit opposite are still very sensitive about him. The position regarding the asthma program and the rural health program, as I indicated yesterday, is that not one cent, not one dollar, will be lost from either of those programs. That is an assurance that I give to the Australian people: not one cent, not one dollar will be lost from those programs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. As was announced yesterday and pointed out in the House by the Prime Minister, we have now reached an understanding that will allow around 85 per cent of our steel exports to the United States to continue to enter that market without being hit by the tariffs that were announced by the US administration last week. Obviously, this is great news for the Australian steel industry and particularly for steel workers in the Australian steel industry, their families and their communities.It should be recognised that this is unprecedented consideration being given to Australia by a US administration on a trade issue - something that was never, ever able to be achieved by Labor governments. This is because they did not get to establish a strong working relationship with their US counterparts. During the lifetime of the previous Labor administration, the trade portfolio was like a revolving door - there were seven ministers in 13 years.  - They were never able to achieve this sort of outcome. When the then US administration applied the EEP subsidies to the wheat program -  - you were unable to achieve any consideration in that regard. - It is quite possible, Mr Speaker, that the member for Fraser might have been the perpetrator at the time who was unable to achieve any outcome as far as his relationship with the United States was concerned.This outcome has not been achieved easily, and it has not been achieved through a rush to the US and a rush to the phones in the last week. We have been working on this relationship since we were elected to office in 1996, and it has been a policy of active, positive engagement with the United States - and it is something that the previous Labor administrations had not been able to achieve. You do not just rush off in reaction to a decision and expect to get an outcome. If our relationship with the United States was not in the excellent state that it is then we would not have been able to achieve this outcome for Australian men and women who work in the steel industry.  - I quote a comment in the press that was made by the US Ambassador here in Canberra. Ambassador Schieffer told the Australian last night:I think what we're doing is working towards something we can both live with ... contrary to what some people say, this is an administration that listens to its friends.And that is at the heart of this. The other side will bemoan the credibility that this government has built up in the relationship with the United States, but there are some Labor politicians in Australia that recognise the importance of this. There are some Labor politicians in Australia who recognise good policy when they see it. Unfortunately, none of them is sitting on the other side of this chamber today. Yesterday, we had the instance of the Premier of Queensland, who arguably may end up here down here - after the last election there was talk of maybe drafting Peter Beattie to come down here and lead the Labor Party in Canberra. But at least the Queensland Premier can recognise good policy. Yesterday it was the GST; today it is the Liberal-National Party government's policy of a free trade agreement with the United States. There is ambiguity about this on the other side and there is certainly ambiguity about this in the Labor Party movement. The Leader of the Opposition should be asked how he is going to reconcile the view of the industrial branch of the Labor movement in Australia with the view of the sound thinkers in the Labor Party, such as the Queensland Premier.The Queensland Premier, who is in the United States at the moment, was on television this morning - I think he was on the Today program - and he said:... one of the things I do support is a bilateral free trade - free trade - we need to send this message and the Labor Party needs to send this message to Doug Cameron. Mr Beattie said:... one of things I do support is a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States - I repeat it again:... a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. That's being negotiated now.I am pleased that he has recognised that we are moving along quickly with it. He went on to say:The sooner it happens the better. It then means you can't have these 30 per cent tariffs imposed. He is agreeing with our policy and it is something that the members on the other side have not come to terms with yet. At least the Queensland Premier recognises good policy. There is no policy on the other side and, of course, there is no forward-looking policy in the industrial branch of the Australian Labor Party either.</DOC>

 - Applications under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act are lodged with the Foreign Investment Review Board. They are considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board and a recommendation is made to the Treasurer. The Treasurer's obligation in considering applications under that act is the national interest, and the legal advice that has been tendered to me is that one cannot make prejudicial comments about bids before a decision is made without triggering a possible claim of denial of natural justice, or bias or some other administrative remedy. In those circumstances, I have adopted the policy of not commenting on bids until they have been determined. Indeed, I am not commenting on bids for commercial-in-confidence reasons. That is the policy that I have followed in relation to all previous applications and that I will follow in relation to this one.  I am then asked about various issues that might follow from the acceptance of such a bid. Let me make it clear that no-one should presume such acceptance from any comment I am about to make. But, of course, conditional approval can be placed in relation to an application. Most recently, some were placed in relation to BHP Billiton, as I recall. That is a matter to be considered again on its merits in accordance with the national interest and I can assure the honourable member that the procedure will be followed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I can assure the House that we are vigorously pursuing quite a range of aviation reforms which are designed to ensure the Australian aviation sector is harmonised with and enjoys all of the advantages of world best practice at the same time as it is sensitive to the particular needs of this particular country. I was able to recently outline to aviation players in a meeting here in Parliament House the key elements of our reform agenda. They include the corporatisation of Air Services Australia; the finalisation of future responsibility for rescue and firefighting services for terminal navigation and tower ATC services; the establishment of an air standards task force to complete the reform of the aviation regulations; a review of the structure and reporting arrangements for CASA, including consideration of that very important aspect of their relationship with their clientele that goes to dispute resolution - and in particular the charge often made by industry that CASA is judge, jury and executioner and whether we ought not to move towards a different set of mechanisms, including perhaps resort to a tribunal in the instance of a serious charge leading to a need to cancel an AOC.We are also again looking very seriously at airspace reform, which goes to the heart of the question that you asked today. All of these are being taken forward vigorously. While I think it is generally known that we have the best upper level airspace system in the world, it has also been my view, and the view of many others for quite a while, that we could improve our lower airspace management in this country. We have indicated that we intend to move to harmonise Australia's airspace arrangements with international best practice. Three years ago we had the class G airspace trial. The objectives were, in my view, laudable but we were not able to successfully execute it because the implementation procedures were perhaps not as well thought through as they might have been.Two airspace proposals are now before me: the low level airspace reform plan, or LAMP, as it is known; and the national airspace system proposal, which is closely related to the North American model. Accordingly, I have convened a special aviation reform group, comprising the chairman of CASA, Mr Ted Anson, the chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth, and well-known Australian identity, Mr Dick Smith. Dick and I are big enough to acknowledge that we have not always agreed on the implementation of reforms but our objectives in airspace reform have never been far apart.  - The separation has closed a bit, Prime Minister, that is right. I am determined to harness his energy and his knowledge of airspace in the interests of the travelling public of Australia, and I think that is the right thing to do. I notice that there is a lot of interest from the other side of the House in this announcement. They will be backed by the special services of a technical group that I have set up and made available to them. I expect their recommendations by 25 March, which is quite close. We will then make a decision on the best airspace model for Australia. I want to say quite clearly that, having made that decision, we will move in sensible, consultative ways to implement that decision in the interests of the safety of the travelling public in Australia.We want to reform the present system in a way that reduces, where possible, costs for the aviation industry and the travelling public, while at the same time maintaining or enhancing safety. Safety will always be the key consideration, but I do believe that a move towards international best practice will maintain and increase safety while reducing complexity and cost. These are very difficult, very technical areas, requiring great expertise. We need to draw on the best knowledge and experience we have in this country, but we need to draw on the best advice we can get from overseas as well, to maximise safety and to do so in a way that claims the greatest cost advantages for the Australian travelling public. I was asked about alternative proposals. I can conclude by simply observing that the opposition has been totally and completely silent on this matter.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition I can confirm that the government's approach to this matter is based upon what I regard as a fairly succinct statement of principle that reads as follows:In my view, ministerial staff are accountable to the minister and the minister is accountable to the parliament and, ultimately, the electors.That is a succinct statement. That statement was, in fact, made by the now shadow Treasurer. I think he was in another position in another place, but it was the same man who made that statement. What we are doing in relation to this issue is following the convention, and the convention is that ministerial staff do not appear. That applies to people who may now be back in the Public Service but who were previously employed in a minister's office, particularly if they were employed under the MOPS Act. We are just following the procedure that the Labor Party followed in government. Incidentally, I note that the Victorian Labor government is, even as I speak, upholding this in relation to an inquiry in the Victorian parliament.You have the inquiry - I think the Australian public knows that it is a politically motivated inquiry. It will be conducted in the normal fashion. That means that any public servant who is invited to attend will naturally go and answer questions truthfully. As for ministerial advisers, as so eloquently enunciated by the member for Fraser, the now shadow Treasurer - he could not have put it better - he said:In my view, ministerial staff are accountable to the minister and the minister is accountable to the parliament and, ultimately, the electors.I could not have put it better. I rest my case.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I have to say that there has been a well-developed and articulated approach on population issues in a number of speeches that I have given over a period of time. Of course, those issues are closely considered by the government in its annual consultations when we look at the question of our migration intake. Information on population directions is provided through that announcement, and through the conferences on population and immigration that I hold, in particular.We have invested very considerable resources in looking at a wide range of relevant issues in this area. For instance, the Department of Family and Community Services had an information paper on low fertility - looking at fertility and causes of fertility decline. The research associated with the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia looked at the impact of population ageing across government, business and community sectors. There was work done by Access Economics for that, as well as the work done by noted demographer, Peter McDonald, who spoke at the summit conference in Melbourne. A well-targeted immigration program is part of a well-developed approach to immigration questions and we have a rigorously tested, highly successful skilled intake. We also promote family friendly policies which minimise falls in fertility. We have labour force, retirement income and health and aged care policies and we have been working on improved environmental management practices.It is a great pity that many of those who attended this so-called summit did not bother to read the research that had been undertaken. I have to say that those who did attend perhaps took more notice of those who had been informing the debate in a realistic way over a long period of time, like Peter McDonald. If they had listened to him before, they may not have been taken away with many of the arguments about what should happen here. But the very important point that ought to be made is that many of those people who spoke at the conference demonstrated an abysmal understanding of current immigration and humanitarian programs. -  - For example, one speaker - the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean - alleged that, in 13 years of ALP government, immigration had averaged 100,000 people a year; whereas, in fact, in the financial years when Mr Crean was a minister and able to influence policies, the net overseas immigration was 69,283. In 1992-93 it fell to 30,000. - You recognise the error of your ways, Leader of the Opposition, when you respond in that way. You also asserted in relation to these matters -  - that the government had undershot its skilled migration targets by 20 per cent and that work force growth, productivity and economic growth would suffer as a result. - The very fact is that minor shortfalls have occurred only in 1996-97 at minus 1.6 per cent and in 1997-98 at minus 1.7 per cent. That contrasts with the last year in which Labor was in office when Senator Bolkus, the then minister, capped off the skilled independent category and there was a shortfall of minus 21.6 per cent. The people who are meant to be informed and to be informing others could not even get right the policies that were operating when they were in office. It is pretty strange that they are out there arguing that we ought to have a formal population policy and a target of the sort that they never set when they were in office and which they now say they could only define and deliver after further consultations. The ridiculous nature of some of the debate that has proceeded, where you get people out arguing that you can have a population for Australia of something in the order of 50 million people without recognising that in order to achieve that outcome -   - What they do not recognise is that you would need to have an immigration program of between 400,000 and 500,000 people per annum to achieve it. Then, presumably, if you want it to stabilise at 50 million - after you had programs of half a million a year for something like 40 years - you would have to turn it off like a tap. It shows how ridiculous it is when you have got people out there -  -  - No, the Leader of the Opposition - arguing for a numerical population target. - Professor Jack Caldwell, one of the most distinguished demographers of Australia, said that we must avoid numerical population targets because pretending that we can calculate them is utter nonsense. The fact is that both of the significant population inquiries of the last decade have found that an optimum population target is not appropriate for Australia and there is no developed or democratic nation that has ever successfully set and delivered population targets.</DOC>

 - As is so often the case, the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is based on a non sequitur. What I said was that the minister was accountable to the parliament. He was a member of the House of Representatives. The question of whether the former minister appears is a matter for him. He is no longer a member of my government and he is not a member of the House. -  - I am told he has obtained some advice from the Clerk of the House. - The position that I have on this is the position that I am explaining to the parliament; that is, in relation to the appearance of ministerial staff, I am following exactly the approach that you lot followed when you were in government, and you know that. In fact, in relation to the appearance of public servants, years and years ago when I was first in this place, the Whitlam government would not even allow public servants to appear before the Senate. -  - We had that unedifying spectacle of public servants of the repute of the late Sir Frederick Wheeler having to inform the Senate that they had been instructed by their ministers and instructed by Prime Minister Whitlam that they were not allowed to appear.What we are doing in relation to this is treating this Senate inquiry in the way that Labor governments treated Senate inquiries when they were in office. We are doing no different. We are treating it in exactly the same fashion. The public servants will be allowed to appear, in accordance with the convention that was established during the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments - in accordance with the time-honoured convention. Let me repeat the words of the member for Fraser, because it is almost Lord Chief Justice McMullan enunciating the principle, and he put it well. Senator McMullan, as he then was, had this to say: In my view, ministerial staff are accountable to the minister and the minister is accountable to the parliament and, ultimately, the electors.Game, set and match.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. Our government take very seriously our responsibility of representing Australia's exporters' interests in all markets of the world - not just the large markets but also the very important markets of the Pacific rim. New Caledonia is part of that market, which generates about $4 billion worth of trade. It is very important to a lot of exporters, particularly along the eastern seaboard and in Queensland. We know how important the Queensland government see trade in the economic make-up of the state of Queensland. Last week I had the opportunity of visiting New Caledonia. To my knowledge I was the first Australian trade minister to visit New Caledonia. Another first for the Howard-Anderson government was to send their trade minister to New Caledonia. Last week I signed a trade and economic relations arrangement with the government of New Caledonia which will provide a foundation for ongoing and growing opportunities for trade and investment in New Caledonia. A lot of that will come from Queensland. There is a relationship that counts in the many hundreds of millions of dollars now and that is significantly in Australia's interest. There is an expanding nickel mining industry in New Caledonia that the New Caledonians are very anxious to see Australian companies become involved in and invest in for the future, particularly companies like BHP. That was made abundantly clear whilst we were there.But it also offers an opportunity for new entrants into the export marketplace - people who are just starting to export in areas such as food, beverages and clothing. Education is already a big export between New Caledonia and, again, Queensland. Building materials are traded between that Pacific island state and Australia. It is very important that we recognise the broad range of work that is being done, particularly by our officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade, around the Pacific, generating billions and billions of dollars worth of trade and investment opportunities for Australian businesses. Out of this new agreement that has been signed with New Caledonia we will be able to provide the opportunity for New Caledonians to be able to enjoy Foster's beer made in Australia not Scotland, and to be able to enjoy having Weet-Bix for breakfast and not just croissants.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and I congratulate her on her outstanding beginning to her parliamentary career. This government is very proud of the fact that it is the first government in Australian history to put in place a comprehensive scheme of protection of employee entitlements. Thanks to this government's policies, Australian employees whose businesses go bust can be certain that they will receive 100 per cent. -  - Thanks to the policies of this government, Australian workers whose businesses fail will receive 100 per cent of their statutory and community standard entitlements. This is the first government in Australia's history to do anything like this. Yesterday, the opposition announced their entitlements proposal and, typically enough, their proposal is just another tax. Last year, Premier Bracks of Victoria, talking about how to protect worker entitlements, said:The better scheme is one which operates around Europe and other countries for a simple surcharge of about 0.5 per cent of salary.Also last year, the member for Barton, the shadow minister for workplace relations, said:We have calculated - on expert advice, I have got to say, with actuaries and so forth - that a 0.6 per cent levy in addition to the superannuation levy would guarantee worker entitlements.After saying last year that a 0.5 per cent levy or, after consulting with actuaries, a 0.6 per cent levy is necessary to protect entitlements, yesterday the opposition said that a 0.1 per cent levy would do the trick. I think the member for Barton needs to go back to his experts and his actuaries and he needs to work out why what was necessary last year is not necessary now. Perhaps he might set himself one of Labor's notorious 1,000 day deadlines to come up with a clarification. Of course, with rostered days off and union picnic days, that would certainly take the clarification well past the next election!The first problem with Labor's entitlements policy is that the figures are completely untrustworthy. The second problem with Labor's entitlements policy is that, notwithstanding the ASIC investigation into whether Air New Zealand has breached Australia's Corporations Law, Labor want to confiscate the assets of Air New Zealand to pay workers' entitlements. This would create the biggest trans-Tasman ruckus since the underarm bowling incident. The third problem is that members opposite do not believe their own policy, because, if they did, the six state Labor governments would immediately put in place - as they are entitled to - a 0.1 per cent levy on payrolls. Labor had 13 years to do something to protect worker entitlements. They did not have 1,000 days; they had nearly 5,000 days to do something about worker entitlements. They never did something when they were in government and they do not deserve to be believed on this subject now.</DOC>

 - Could I first of all correct the member for Newcastle in the assertion contained in her question that it was an admission, because what I was doing yesterday was repeating what I had said at a press conference - therefore the suggestion that in some way it was an admission. As to whether I should or should not have said certain things to Fran Kelly, I was asked that question, if I recollect correctly, on Four Corners by another employee of the ABC, and I made the point to her, as I think I have made it to other people, that the government believed that the important thing at that time was the release of the video - and of course we did release the video.It fascinates me that the opposition see some kind of point in this. The question of how I answer a particular question is conditioned by my knowledge of circumstances, and on that particular occasion - which was the Press Club address before the election - by my desire to make certain that the video was released and that therefore the Australian people had an opportunity of viewing that material before the election. So, far from that representing some attempt to cover up or some attempt to obfuscate, I think it was an exercise in total candour. I compare it with a lack of candour. My mind wanders back to 1993. My mind wanders back to the 1990 election, and I am reminded of GST on fresh foods three days before that election. I was releasing a video, even though it was, on the advice I had received, inconclusive, yet three days before that election, the Leader of the Opposition was falsely alleging that we were going to put a GST on food. The frauds of Australian politics are those who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper. Is this his maiden question? It should have been his maiden question. The concerns of small businesses in electorates such as Cowper are similarly displayed right around Australia. In fact, last week in Tasmania I attended a number of small business forums organised by Senator Guy Barnett, who is our newest senator on board. He came straight out of small business into the Senate. The two major forums were in Hobart and Launceston. As the member for Cowper would know, small business are concerned about the state of the economy and they think we are doing just great. They are concerned about consumer confidence and they think that is great too, they are concerned about keeping interest rates low and we are delivering on that and they are concerned about keeping inflation low and we are delivering on that. They like what we are doing and they are pretty pleased with the fact that we are continuing to work away at reducing taxes and the tax burden on small business.At the public meetings in Tasmania, particularly in Launceston, I must say that I was a little disappointed that the member for Bass was not present. The Launceston Examiner was there - and the member for Bass would be familiar with the experience of GST and the Launceston Examiner. It says something that the Launceston Examiner was there and that the member for Bass was not - it was a public meeting. The member for Lyons was at the public meeting in Launceston. I think at last we have found a champion for small business in the Labor Party. He is a rare and endangered species - a rare bird. The member for Lyons - a defender of small business in the Labor Party! I have already canvassed with the Minister for Environment and Heritage whether we can put him on the endangered species list.At that public meeting there were nearly 100 small business operators, and I asked them this question: how many businesses have been affected by Labor's unfair dismissal laws? The hands went up. I asked the question: how many businesses had to settle claims for unfair dismissal away from lawyers because they could not afford either the legal fees or the time away from their work to fight their case? A huge number of hands went up. The member for Lyons was there and he saw it. I thought to myself and I said to the meeting that the member for Lyons should go and tell the Leader of the Opposition how deeply the unfair dismissal laws are biting into small business. Over the last few days I have been expecting to get a phone call from Ben from Bentleigh or to perhaps get a phone call from the member for Lyons saying that in fact he told the Leader of the Opposition about it. But the member for Lyons has disappointed me. I thought he was a champion of small business and I went to his web site - the Dick Adams web site. It has got, at the top of the page, `Vote for Dick', and then it has got, `About Dick'. It says:See what I have to say on issues that affect us all.I went down the list and I found small business. I went to small business, clicked the page up and said, `Here is Dick's blueprint for small business' - and it is a blank page, completely blank! I want to table the blank page because it is indicative of the fact that the Labor Party stands for nothing and believes in nothing, and the Leader of the Opposition has nothing different in his policy platform from that of the member for Lyons when it comes to small business.</DOC>

 - I do not have that transcript with me and I certainly do not intend to accept that - with no disrespect to the member for Capricornia, who has not to my knowledge personally been guilty of a `Creanism' when it comes to quoting statements made by members of the frontbench. I will have a look at that, but my recollection is that - and I think you said that I was interviewed by him on the 8th - the context of that interview was some comments that had been made by Admiral Shackleton during the afternoon and that the second interview was in fact consequent upon a statement which had been issued by Admiral Shackleton that afternoon in which he had confirmed that Defence had advised the minister that children had been thrown overboard.</DOC>

 - I especially thank the member for Macquarie for what have been six very strong years of advocacy for his electorate and in particular for education. Most recently he has been to see me, and he has phoned me twice, in support of $2,250 being made available to the Kindlehill Hill school in his electorate, which - along with 57 other newly established non-government schools - is being denied funding. It is obvious that Ben has been very busy. I told the House yesterday that, throughout the last year, the Australian Labor Party has been adamant in its opposition to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2002. In fact, it has opposed the bill twice. In doing so, it is trying to prevent 58 schools - two-thirds of which service some of the poorest communities and families in the country - from getting access to important funds that they need to get these schools established and up and running. That is inflicting pain and grief on everyday Australian families and their children. The member for Jagajaga was in this place just a month ago offering potentially obstructive amendments, which I have been considering, but still at that time refusing again to pass the bill. The member for Fisher, who is a very effective member of this place, has also been -  - The member for Fisher has also been to see me and has had his staff contact my office on several occasions, in relation to the Pacific Lutheran College in Caloundra, which is short of funding which is the equivalent to the funding for a full-time teacher in a staff of eight. So if you have eight teachers in a school and you cannot fund one of them, then perhaps the member for Fisher will now be able to go back and tell those families what the reaction has been from the Australian Labor Party to his efforts to try to get funding for that school. - As I said yesterday, the member for Barker is to be congratulated for his very strong advocacy for the Encounter Lutheran School in Victor Harbour and the Vineyard Lutheran School in Clare, which has had to cut $30,000 from the professional development of its teaching staff because it is being denied urgently needed establishment funds, which we are waiting for the Australian Labor Party to pass unamended in the Australian Senate. Yesterday, I told the House about the Chabad Jewish Day School in Bentleigh in Victoria and the commendable efforts of Ben from Bentleigh - Ben's our man down there! - to pursue the money that is owed to the school, presumably, one would think, on behalf of the member for Hotham, who happens to be the leader of the Australian Labor Party in name. So it has been a long running and difficult affair for these schools, but perhaps things are about to change. As an avid reader of newspapers, and the Melbourne Age in particular -  - The Melbourne Age reports today:Fortunately for the school - and presumably for Ben - Labor has changed its tune on the legislation since the election, and there are hopes that it will pass. The question is: what has changed? Why is the Australian Labor Party reportedly now going to pass the legislation, which it has opposed twice and foreshadowed to amend in the Senate? -  - The only thing that seems to have changed is that Ben from Bentleigh is now involved, and he is involved on behalf of the Chabad Jewish Day School in the electorate of Hotham. Ben from Bentleigh is obviously like a bulldog. - As I was about to remind the House, Ben, who is doing a great job for the Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School, phoned my office twice on 26 February. He also sent a fax and pointed out to us what the problem is for the Chabad Jewish Day School, which is being denied $6,000 - which might not seem a lot to some members on the opposition benches but, if you are trying to get a school going with struggling families, it is a hell of a lot of money. - I would like to return to giving credit to Ben, who works in the electorate office of the member for Hotham. Obviously, Ben has made a difference. The simple thing that the Leader of the Opposition needs to do now is to get up and say that the legislation will be passed. In concluding, I would like to return honourable members -  - The fundamental problem here, which is why it has been so difficult for me to answer this question on behalf of the government, is that the Australian Labor Party is trying to conceal the fact that it is divided on the issue of support for non-government schools. In concluding, I return honourable members to the Bird in Hand Inn, in the electorate of Macquarie, which was mentioned in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 November 2001. Against the noise of greyhound racing and the pokies in the Bird in Hand Inn, Greg Fletcher, who is a factory worker, said:... the Labor Party's pledge to take money away from private schools had not been popular.The final quote -  - This is how working men and working women in this country feel about this issue. - Greg Fletcher from the electorate of Macquarie, explaining why he thought it was important that the Howard government be returned, said:People around here don't have much money -  - Greg Fletcher - when explaining why he and his wife, Gina, so strongly supported the re-election of the Howard government - said:People around here don't have much money but they save and save so that they can send their kids to a private school and get a good education and then Labor says you shouldn't try to do this.Pass the legislation! </DOC>

 - I will have a look at what the Leader of the Opposition asked me and what I replied. Just for the record, at no stage have I misled the House or the Australian people. At no stage have I misled the House or the Australian people. Can I also, while I am on my feet, refer to an earlier question that was asked by somebody on the other side - I do not know whether it was by the Leader of the Opposition - about the photographs. Since being asked that question, I have checked and I have been informed by Mr Tony O'Leary, Mr Tony Nutt and also Mr Miles Jordana that they have not received any photographs at the relevant times. In relation to other people who may have received any, a request has been made of the Department of Defence for that information, and until I get clear and unequivocal advice from the Department of Defence I will not be saying anything further in relation to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. As it does go to a serious issue, I might take a little longer in providing the answer than might otherwise be the case. Yes, I am aware of the speech made in the Senate last night by my parliamentary secretary Senator Bill Heffernan. It raises both a serious and difficult issue. Mr Justice Kirby has been a member of the High Court for a number of years. He enjoys in Australia a very good and fine legal reputation and he is a person who is well known to many people in this place on both sides, including me. Insofar as our dealings have been necessary, I have always had cordial and gracious dealings with him.The speech that was made last night by Senator Heffernan did raise a number of very significant allegations. I do not say this critically - I offer it by way of information - it was a speech that he had made off his own bat. The issues generally that were canvassed in the speech are issues that have been generally canvassed by Senator Heffernan in the past with me and a number of my other colleagues. They are issues on which he feels very strongly and very deeply.I do agree with the foreign minister that parliamentary privilege is, as the description implies, a privilege. It does have to be used carefully and properly, but it is ultimately there for any of us to use if we believe the circumstances warrant it, otherwise it would not be there. Ultimately, it is very hard to codify the circumstances in which parliamentary privilege should be used. Obviously, given what he sees to be the history of this matter, my colleague Senator Heffernan felt that he was justified in using parliamentary privilege to air the matters which he did. In relation to allegations made against them, all people in this country - whether they be High Court judges, ordinary citizens, governors-general, people holding political office - are entitled to a presumption of innocence. That applies to every citizen in this country irrespective of his or her station in life.As a result of the speech that was made last night, I have had a number of discussions with Senator Heffernan and I am going to table two letters. I am going to table a letter that Senator Heffernan has written to me and also a copy of the letter that Senator Heffernan has written to the New South Wales police commissioner, Commissioner Peter Ryan. It will be apparent from the letter that Senator Heffernan has written to me that he did, in fact, raise these matters with the police as far back as 1998. Any suggestion that he used parliamentary privilege as a first resort rather than as a last resort is wrong. - Yes, he does say what happened and the letter will explain the response that he was given by the police. He has written again to the New South Wales Police asking that this matter be further investigated. In his letter to me, he states as follows:As my letter to the Commissioner indicates, I have previously provided background information relating to the potential commitment of criminal offences. That information was subsequently assessed by the NSW Police Service and I was advised by a Senior Officer that because the allegations provided in a police statement involved a person aged 17 years and 6 months, and although of serious concern for the police, there was no prosecution undertaken because in their assessment it would not meet the technical prosecution guidelines of the NSW DPP.Those are Senator Heffernan's words. I have no independent knowledge as to whether those claims are true or false. Senator Heffernan has written again to the commissioner asking that the matter be further investigated. In his letter to me, Senator Heffernan has also said that he believes it would be appropriate that he stand aside from his position as parliamentary secretary until such time as these matters have been further investigated. This next comment is made on the basis of my discussion with the senator and it is not in the letter: he said that he acknowledges that I was not given notice that he was going to make the speech last night and - although he holds very strongly to the views that he has expressed in the speech and he does not resile from them one iota - he thinks it is appropriate, both in his interests and in the interests of the government, that he step aside from his duties while this matter is assessed. I accept his assessment of that, but I should emphasise that he has initiated that. He is very comfortable with that and I think it is the right course of action to take.Two issues are raised here. One of them relates specifically to the allegations that have been made by Senator Heffernan against Mr Justice Kirby. They need to be further assessed and, depending on what comes out of that further assessment, people will make judgments - I suspend mine until such time as that further assessment is made. The other issue relates to the question of how in the future - I am not talking here specifically of Mr Justice Kirby - generally speaking, we as a parliament should deal with allegations which are made against senior judicial officers of the Commonwealth. It is an area where, frankly, there are gaps. You have a situation where, under the Constitution, a federal judge holds office until he or she reaches the age of 70 and can only be removed by a finding of both houses of parliament that he or she has been guilty of proved misbehaviour. There is no preliminary procedure to assess the value or otherwise of allegations that are made. As recently as a couple of years ago, when allegations were made - as the member for Barton will recall - against Mr Justice Callinan, even though the view was taken by the government that those allegations did not have merit in terms of the relevant section of the Constitution, the opposition argued that there should be a judicial examination of those allegations by three retired judges.It is fair to say that in the past from both sides there have been allegations of unsuitability to hold a high judicial office. This is not the first time an allegation of this type has been made, and it probably will not be the last occasion. It is therefore time that the parliament, and in particular the government, gave more urgent consideration to a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission - most recently in recommendation 12, where it was recommended that the federal parliament should develop and adopt a protocol governing the receipt and investigation of serious complaints against federal judicial officers. It says:For these purposes, a `serious complaint' is one which, if made out, warrants consideration by the Parliament of whether to present an address to the Governor-General praying for the removal of the judicial officer in question, pursuant to s 72 of the Constitution.There is a strong case for examination by the parliament of the adoption of such a protocol. The value of it would be that, where allegations are made or people wish to make those allegations, they would not be left with the choice of either the person in question being determined by the criminal justice processes of one of the Australian states to have been guilty of a criminal offence or, alternatively, resorting to allegations being made in this or another chamber under the cover of parliamentary privilege. The advantage of the adoption of a protocol of this kind would be that, in future, people who had these allegations could go to this body in the first instance and have the value of those allegations assessed.As I said at the commencement of this answer - and I apologise for its length, but it is a serious and sensitive issue and it does deserve to be treated seriously - the judge in question enjoys a high reputation in the legal profession. The senator in question enjoys both my affection and my friendship, and I know that he holds the views that he expresses on matters very deeply and very conscientiously. The procedure that I have outlined in relation not only to his standing aside but also to the matter being fully and further investigated by the New South Wales Police is the appropriate procedure. I also commend to members on both sides of the House a very strong belief that we need to adopt a protocol that will provide a more practical and effective mechanism for dealing with complaints of this kind, from wherever and through whomsoever they may arise in the future. I table both the letter dated today from Senator Heffernan to me and a copy of a letter from Senator Heffernan to Commissioner Peter Ryan, the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police force. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I am pleased to report to the House that, after a pretty challenging time in the transport sector, we are now seeing some very encouraging signs of growth. That will be needed - transport represents around nine per cent of gross domestic product at the moment. With predictions that the freight volume task in this country is likely to grow threefold between now and 2020, we are certainly going to need an efficient transport industry. The growth that we are seeing now does not come about by accident; it is enabled and facilitated by the policy settings of the government. In that light, I am very pleased indeed that in the aviation sector we are now seeing the prospect of very strong growth by Virgin Blue Airlines, since Virgin Blue Airlines and Patrick Corporation announced yesterday that they had signed a $260 million agreement for Patrick Corporation to acquire a 50 per cent shareholding in Virgin Blue. I am confident that Virgin, which really has shown that a competently and efficiently run company can compete successfully with the big players, will be able to further grow its market share and will therefore be in an even better position to offer consumers real choice in whom they fly with.I am advised that plans are already afoot for the airline to increase its fleet from 16 to 23 state-of-the-art Boeing 737 aircraft by the end of the year. I also understand it is planning to grow the fleet to a total of 50 aircraft over the next five years. So it is good news for Virgin Blue and Patricks, good news for jobs - and, while I would not want to raise any false hopes, I think it does present further opportunities for some of those Ansett employees looking for employment - good news for the travelling public and for competition, and good news for the Australian economy.I have to say it is absolutely essential that the union movement does not sabotage the Virgin Blue deal as a result of their hatred of Chris Corrigan. We already see the Labor movement split on this issue. This morning Hughie Williams from the TWU warned:I think we've got to keep a very close eye on Mr Corrigan. We know what he's capable of doing.Like cleaning up the waterfront and growing our export industries and all the jobs in them! I am most concerned that members of the opposition might not have heard what the member for Batman said on Sydney radio this morning. He showed a surprising lack of understanding of the last hundred years of history of the ACTU and the Labor movement by claiming:The Labor Party and the union movement don't go through life trying to settle scores.That was the member for Batman this morning. So we will see who is right: whether it is Hughie Williams warning about Mr Corrigan, or the member for Batman saying - either in ignorance of their history or because they have turned over a new leaf - that they do not go through life seeking to settle scores. Very importantly, Patricks is also involved in the national rail consortium -  - Dear, oh dear! I have struck a raw nerve. Patricks is also involved -  -  - Interesting or not, we do not want to pursue transport reform. Patricks is also involved in the national rail consortium through the Lang Corporation, and I think that also offers the opportunity for real synergies in terms of cross-modal reform, cross-modal efficiencies. The national rail consortium will develop an integrated road and rail freight system building on a very extensive network of regional depots. That will have major implications for the development of the transport efficiencies we are going to need in the Australian community in years to come.It is worth noting on the way through that no government has done more for local roads than the current government, as well. Recognising, as we do, the important role played by local roads in our overall transport infrastructure, we launched the Roads to Recovery program in November 2000. It has assisted 717 councils so far to undertake 6,600 projects at a value of nearly $400 million. I take pleasure in tabling the first Roads to Recovery annual report, which details the first year of its activity. - It's a great program. They love it out there, Mr Prime Minister. - Yes, that is right. It has given them an ability to get their kids to school on a wet day and things like that. The report reveals that 44 per cent of funds went to reconstruction, rehabilitation and widening of existing roads, 30 per cent to regravelling, sealing and resealing roads, and 11 per cent to bridge and drainage works. They are excellent figures and they show the program is working well.I was also asked whether there are any impediments to the delivery of further efficiencies. There are many - and they all sit opposite. We need only to remember the Labor Party's opposition to Roads to Recovery. That is a good case in point, but there is a more poignant issue at hand at the moment that involves air traffic controller strike action at a time when I thought that everyone in this country would have thought it imperative that we make sure the aviation sector is given every chance to recover its strength after September 11 and other events and that important industries like tourism are also given every chance to recover. I can think of nothing more irresponsible, at a time when the aviation sector is in a fragile state after the events of last year, than the actions of those five unions at the moment. I think it is time that we saw the holding company of the Australian Labor Party, the union movement, recognise that the AIRC has strongly recommended that they go back to negotiation because there are no reasons for this strike. Negotiations have not failed; they have not been seriously undertaken - and that ought to be reversed forthwith.</DOC>

 - I am aware that the New South Wales police minister has made a statement, and it would appear to me - while I have not read it in the last few minutes - to be substantially to the effect. This is an issue that is somewhat atypical, but if the opposition wishes to turn questions on this matter into the normal slanging exchange of question time then I think it would be a great pity. -  - You are the most unctuous opposition leader we have had for years. -  - The sequence of events is that the senator made approaches to the New South Wales Police, he was not satisfied with the response that he got, he exercised his right as a member of parliament to further ventilate those matters and, immediately that was done, he was encouraged to refer the matter to the New South Wales Police. He has referred it back. I believe that is the proper course of action, and I believe that the action that I have taken is entirely proper. The question of whether the exercise of parliamentary privilege -  - by an individual senator or member is appropriate is a subjective judgment; different people will have different views. I certainly believe that, in the past, members of the Labor Party -  - have abused parliamentary privilege. They have abused parliamentary privilege to attack justices of the High Court, but because they were justices of the High Court identified with this side of politics then apparently that is acceptable.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and for her interest in the national economy. I can report to her that both international and domestic surveys show that the Australian economy has strong momentum. In fact, this week's Economist magazine, which has a regular poll of forecasters, has Australia forecast as having the strongest growth rate of any of the major industrialised countries through the course of 2002, at 3.4 per cent. I am sure the Labor Party will welcome strong prognostications of growth in Australia. The second highest is Britain at 1.9 per cent, so Australia is just a little under double the second highest growth rate forecast for 2002. In 2003, Australia is again forecast to have the highest growth of any of the country forecasts in the Economist poll. I think all Australians would welcome that news, especially on this side of the House. That comes on top of a growth rate of 4.1 per cent in 2001, which was the highest of any of the industrialised countries and indeed 10 times the average of the OECD. So the outcome for 2001 was the highest, the forecast for 2002 was the strongest and the forecast for 2003 was the strongest.This week we had the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment survey, which rose to a level of 116, the fifth consecutive rise since the drop in confidence on the back of September 11; we had the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends showing a strengthening of business activity; and we had the National Australia Bank monthly business survey showing business conditions increasing for February. So I think the good news is that notwithstanding an international recession - a recession in the United States, a third recession in Japan in a decade, a recession in Singapore, a recession in Taiwan, a recession in Germany and a weakness in Europe - the Australian economy continues to perform strongly. Members of this House will recall that not everybody forecast that that would be the case in 2001. There were a lot of people in 2001 gleefully anticipating a recession in the Australian economy - and none more so than the member for Hotham, who took great delight in attempting to mislead the Australian public. Perhaps I will just finish by referring him to the advice that was given by the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, in the Financial Review in January. As far as I am aware, Mr Carr is the only Labor leader who has an economic policy, which he put out in January of 2002, urging Mr Crean and others to adopt. He made this observation when he did so:The electorate hesitated to vote for Labor, in part because of concerns about economic management.The electorate was right about that, and I can say that, since the November election until now, the Labor Party has not come up with a single economic policy. It is now six years bereft of any economic policy or any thinking, and it shows no signs of improving. Can I recommend that you take the advice of Premier Carr. The electorate did hesitate to vote for Labor because it knows that Labor has no credentials on economic management. If Labor were to try and get some, I urge you to come out and support the government in its economic policy and recognise the advantages that that has brought in Australian growth rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and congratulate him for the fine start he has made as a member of this House. - I am aware of a survey by Australia's peak accountancy body which entirely vindicates the government's position on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002. This survey shows that 42 per cent of small businesses think that they do not know how to properly comply with unfair dismissal laws. More importantly, it shows that 76 per cent of accountants dealing with small businesses think that those businesses are confused about how to cope with unfair dismissal laws. Mr Speaker, 62 per cent of small businesses and 81 per cent of accountants think that the unfair dismissal process is complex - perhaps far too complex.This survey amply demonstrates the need for reform to everyone except, it would seem, the shadow minister for workplace relations, the member for Barton. He put out a press release today saying that reform is unnecessary because only five per cent of small businesses nominated unfair dismissal as the chief obstacle to employment growth. Five per cent of small businesses translates to 50,000 individual enterprises, and that means 52,000 new jobs if those businesses take on just one extra staff member. According to the member for Barton, just three per cent of small businesses would be encouraged to employ new staff by the repeal of the unfair dismissal laws. That would translate to 30,000 new jobs if these laws were repealed.I have to say that I feel a bit sorry for the member for Barton; being the workplace relations spokesman inside the Labor Party is a little like being the education minister at a Teachers Federation conference - everyone thinks he knows better than you. The member for Barton might be a third generation Labor peer but he has never been a trade union official, unlike just about everyone else on the front bench. If you read the shadow minister's press release, you can see that it is actually a cry for help. It is a coded plea for his colleagues to see reason. The member for Barton says that `many small business operators have fears about unfair dismissal'. The press release goes on:Twenty-seven percent (27%) of small business operators were worried that 'you can't dismiss a person even if they are stealing from you'.Thirty percent (30%) of small businesses thought that the employer always lost unfair dismissal cases ...The employer always loses by the time you take into account the time and money involved in dealing with these cases. The member for Barton and all sensible, intelligent members opposite know that there is only one way to remove this handbrake on the creation of new jobs in Australia - that is, to pass the government's fair dismissal laws.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I recognise the great interest he has in the issue of people-smuggling. He raises this issue very much on behalf of his constituents, who I know are particularly concerned about this issue given the geography of the electorate of Kalgoorlie. The Australian government hosted with Indonesia what has become known as the Bali conference on people-smuggling. This was a very significant conference, attended by 38 ministerial level representatives from countries of origin, transit and destination that are used by people smugglers. Importantly, this meeting very significantly raised the profile of the campaign against people-smuggling in the region, with ministers agreeing in particular on the importance of legislative measures to criminalise people-smuggling and trafficking. In many countries of the region people-smuggling is not a crime, and there was a consensus that the countries involved needed to improve their legislative regimes. There was also agreement that there should be cooperative action in fields such as intelligence sharing, law enforcement, border management and return arrangements. At the end of the meeting I appointed John Buckley, who is our outgoing ambassador to the Philippines, as the Ambassador for People-Smuggling Issues. I was also pleased that, at the meeting, Afghanistan confirmed its willingness to accept Afghans who choose to return home. There was a very useful contribution made by Afghanistan at the meeting.The honourable member for Kalgoorlie asked if there are any alternative approaches. All I can say is that the alternative approaches of the Australian Labor Party cause one to question the credibility of the Labor Party as an opposition. I note, for example, that on the Sunday before the Bali people-smuggling conference the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, went on an ABC program called Insiders - the informal program. The member for Griffith said that the people-smuggling conference would not really be effective because `Pakistan will not be represented at the conference, either by its foreign minister or any other minister'. He went on to argue, using a cricketing metaphor, Prime Minister, that this was like the International Cricket Council having a meeting without England. That does cause you to reflect. I think his point was meant to be, if I can put it that way, that this meeting would not be credible without Pakistan's participation. The opposition often alleges that the government's standards of integrity are not high enough, which seems to suggest that the opposition's standards must be very high. The fact is that, despite this allegation, the minister for the interior of Pakistan very much enjoyed the Bali people-smuggling conference, as did his officials. The meeting was a great success. The opposition ran a line that the conference was not going to work because Pakistan was going to be absent, but Pakistan was there, and not only at ministerial level.Why wouldn't the opposition be deceptive on this sort of an issue? After all, at the last election they ran the greatest deception of all, which was -  -  - And they laugh at it! The greatest deception of all, as we know on this side of the House, was that the people over there said they supported the government's policy on border control, knowing all the time that if they were to win the election they would change the policy. And when they lost the election - those who were elected in marginal seats having got elected on the basis of their supporting the government's policy - they went out and abandoned it. What is the Labor Party's policy now on these issues? The opposition spokesman on foreign affairs said at the end of November that there would be a review process:I would imagine it would take some months. During the period of our policy review we couldn't articulate an alternative policy.He went on to say, meaningfully:I mean, it's logical ...Then we have the member for Lalor, who is the opposition spokesman on immigration, saying later:However, we've now got three years to review the policy. The policy that's right for Australia in 2005 might be quite a different one.I will tell you what the Labor Party's policy in 2005 will be: it will be the government's policy because when an election draws near the Labor Party will abandon its three-year policy review and its policy debate, and just do what it did before and adopt the government's policy. Months have passed now since the last election and we expect the Labor Party to start coming up with a few ideas and a few policies, not just smear campaigns. If I may say so, it is pathetic when a Leader of the Opposition only ever sees, to the best of my knowledge, Asia from 35,000 feet up in the seat of a plane. All I can say is that this is an opposition which has no policy except a three-year review. It is a pitiful reflection on a pitiful opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question - obviously, representing an area where there are a number of jobs and workers engaged in the steel industry, and particularly the steel industry that exports to the United States. I recognise his very keen interest in what this government has achieved on this issue, in conjunction with the industry, and some of the comments that have been made by different people with regard to their position.As has been mentioned earlier this week, we have achieved an unprecedented outcome in terms of improving the position of the Australian steel exports into the United States market during the last week. We aim to continue to address the remaining 15 per cent that I know is of concern to all members in this House - including the member for Cunningham, who represents an area where there are steelworkers. As part of that process, next week we are going to call together interested parties in regard to where we take the balance of our argument on the remaining 15 per cent that we expect are still going to be affected by tariffs. Next week we are going to get together in Canberra the companies that are involved in exporting steel to the United States (BHP Steel, Smorgon and OneSteel) to talk with the relevant ministers - me, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Minister for Justice and Customs - and have a look at the plan of attack for the future.It is also of interest that my office has been contacted in the last couple of days by none other than the President of the ACTU, Ms Sharan Burrow, about participating in the summit. Sharan suggested that she might bring four or five representatives from different unions along. I am considering inviting Sharan along to have a discussion about it if they can be constructive. But there are a number of people involved in the union movements in Australia who have not been very constructive at all in this whole debate. One of them had an article in the paper in the member's electorate. This is just an outrageous comment by someone supposed to be representing the steelworkers of Australia. The comment was made by Mr Eagles in Victoria. The headline is `Steelworkers back US tariffs'. How outrageous is that? US tariffs are going to cost his members jobs, yet he backs the tariffs. It is a ridiculous statement. You cannot say that that is making a constructive contribution to the efforts of the government and the steel industry to resolve this issue. This article states that concerning the announcement of George W. Bush, Mr Eagles took a different tune from Australian voices raised against the US. He said: `The United States Steel Workers' Union intervened to protect jobs,' said Mr Eagles. `We congratulate them on these tariffs.'That is the situation of the union movement in Victoria as far as this issue is concerned. It is in the local Hastings Independent newspaper. We know that other representatives of the Labor Party in Australia have supported the government on this position. Yesterday, we heard about Mr Beattie's support all the way from Washington - or New York, or wherever he was - not just on our position on this issue but also on the free trade agreement that we are pursuing with the United States.  Today we see another leading light of the Labor Party in Australia, none other than the Premier of New South Wales. In his press release, he uses a word that we have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition for almost 12 months - the `R' word. Mr Carr said:Carr on US steel tariff roll-back.We have not heard `roll-back' from the Labor Party in this House for a while. Mr Carr said:Following representations from the Australian Ambassador and the federal government, the US has agreed to exempt a further 250,000 metric tonnes of steel.He went on to say:This is a major concession from the United States and a big win for the Australian steel producers.He also went on to say:In a bipartisan spirit, I warmly commend the federal government.Thank you, Mr Carr. There has never been any bipartisan support from the Labor Party in this chamber in the last six or seven years on any public policy matter that has improved the circumstance of Australians and Australian workers. We will participate and we will conduct the summit next week and we will expect all the participants to be constructive in their contributions, not like Mr Eagles from Victoria, who is backing the tariffs that would have cost his members jobs. It would have cost his members jobs, except for the work that the government and the steel industry have done in terms of lobbying the US administration on this issue. So we look forward to the summit. But I think the steel workers in the electorate of the member for Flinders should question their leadership and the position they are taking on this issue.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the honourable member for Parramatta for his maiden success, although I point out that he was only up against the member for Fraser. The point that is made by the member for Parramatta I think explains that the member for Fraser has never put any serious matters in relation to these issues. It has always been an attempt to make invalid and cheap points. He had a very bad day in the Senate inquiry this morning, because after reconvening the Senate estimates committee the Senate was told by the Treasury officials that the Treasury, as they said in their evidence, had recommended the continuation of the cross-currency swap position to all governments of every colour from 1989 until June 2001.  - Until June 2001. That was the recommendation that the Treasury made, as I said, clearly in their evidence to all governments of all persuasions from 1989 until June 2001. As I have already indicated, in June 2001 the advice changed because I suspended the benchmark and called for a full review, which was done in June. We have already put on the record the support which Senator McMullan gave to a swap position - something which he has never actually explained.  - No, he made four years of losses, I am afraid - unrealised losses. Four years of losses, I regret to inform him - unrealised losses. The other point that I thought was very interesting in the Treasury evidence this morning, by the way, is they made the point that physicals were the same as currency swaps and that Australia has been borrowing in foreign currency physicals since the 1930s. Physicals are exposed to movements in the currency exchange rate. I think they made the point that in 1985 and 1986, in a two-year period, as a result of currency devaluation, the unrealised loss on physicals was $8.7 billion.I did not hear any interjections. I was waiting for the howls of horror and shock. As the Treasury said, in 1985 and 1986, as a result of currency devaluations in relation to physicals, the unrealised movement was, in today's dollars, $8.7 billion in a two-year period. I have not actually heard that being mentioned previously. I think the then secretary to the Treasury was perfectly entitled to say, as he did then, that he was relying on Treasury advice in relation to foreign currency physicals. - He was relying on Treasury advice in relation to cross-currency swaps. The Treasury believed, after having external reports from JP Morgan, UBS Warburg, BT Consulting, Carmichael Consulting, in relation to UBS Warburg again, in relation to ANAO reports and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, that this was a reasonable policy. That was the view they held until I asked for a full review in December 2000.  - As a result of that full review, they made a recommendation to terminate the program in June 2001, and it was a program that I terminated after accepting their advice to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip, the member for Robinson, for his first question in this parliament. I know that he has always had a great interest in employment issues and I know that unemployment has reduced dramatically during his term since 1996 as the member for Robinson on the Central Coast.At the outset, I should say that this government would like to believe that no member of the Australian public receiving unemployment benefit should ever be breached, because we believe that there should be a situation whereby those who are using the resources of the taxpayer to help them get back to employment should be able to fulfil their obligations. The unfortunate situation arises when people deem that they do not wish to fulfil their obligations and they then unfortunately find themselves breached.In the recent Pearce report, great play was made on the most vulnerable in our society - those who are homeless, those who perhaps have a drug addiction or some other difficulty which is providing great challenges to them getting back into the work force. This government is very aware of those problems and, from 1 July, we understand that many people will not identify those issues to Centrelink when they apply for unemployment benefit. In fact, why would you? They can often be ashamed of the fact that that may have such a debilitating impact on their applications for work. However, this information comes out after they have spent a period of time with their Job Network member. We are providing a system whereby those individuals, who are the most vulnerable, can be referred back to Centrelink for a more appropriate course of assistance to get rid of the drug addiction, to fix up the domestic violence issue or the homelessness. Those people should not be in the labour market looking for work. We have to get them into the position where those issues are dealt with before we give them the assistance, and this government is prepared to invest money to do that.Unfortunately, there are those who would like to abuse the system and there are those opposite who, in this place and in the other place, have made comments, recorded in Hansard, which indicate that they believe people should not be breached. Senator Evans said:What is it about this government's breaching policy: is it a deliberate policy that they are trying to be harsher on people on benefits?The member for Shortland said:The government has had a long history ... of targeting those people who need assistance. ... It has spent more time and effort on breaching people that need assistance, on trying to make them jump through hoops, than actually trying to help them. Perhaps I could outline to the parliament some cases that have been provided from our community work coordinators, those who run Work for the Dole and Job Network members, of people who have presented that have been breached. - Stephen is a representative case. He is 28 and lives in Melbourne. He started his six-month placement on Work for the Dole in February 2001 and attended the occupational health and safety session on the first day. He did not attend the project again. When contacted, Stephen said he thought the one-day session was all he had to do. For this reason, he was not breached but the rules were re-explained to him - I think a fair and reasonable thing to do. Stephen still did not attend. There were repeated contacts and warnings over several months, but Stephen continued to be absent. He was breached twice in this time until, because of his continued non-attendance, Centrelink imposed a third breach. This breach meant that Stephen's payments stopped in May 2001. I wonder whether those opposite think that that is an inappropriate behaviour on behalf of this government.Then there is the case of Bruce. Bruce is 20 and lives in Adelaide. He did not attend his Work for the Dole interview although he had been sent two separate letters giving him his appointment times and a contact telephone number in case those times were not suitable. When he was asked why he did not attend, he said that he was too busy. He was told that he had to attend the Work for the Dole interview or a participation report would be lodged with Centrelink. Bruce agreed to the appointment time. He attended the interview and complained about having to attend. He said that it had cost him $150 to keep his appointment. When asked what he meant, Bruce said that he couldn't be at the interview because he was at work. That is right; he could not be at a Work for the Dole interview because he was at work, and he is on Work for the Dole because he is receiving taxpayer-funded dole payments - but he thought that that was reasonable. It seemed that Bruce was working regularly but had not reported his income to Centrelink. Centrelink was advised and Bruce was breached.I will give you one other example. This is John -  -  - The interjections from members opposite quite clearly demonstrate that those on this side respect the taxpayers who are providing assistance to the unemployed and those opposite have no respect for the taxpayers or the services -  - Just to put the member for Lilley's conscience at rest, perhaps he would like to explain to the House why Senator Denman said in the Senate Hansard of 23 August:... the current enthusiasm for breaching people is a total disgrace.Perhaps that would put succinctly the feeling of those opposite about this government's commitment to ensuring the public purse is well spent. Let me give you this final example: John. He explained at his initial Work for the Dole interview that he was not well and that he could not -  - John explained at his initial Work for the Dole interview that he was not well and could not take part in the program. He said that he had a doctor's certificate about his illness and he gave it to his supervisor. The certificate described the patient's medical problem as `ovarian condition' - John had an ovarian condition! This, and the appearance of the medical certificate, raised doubts about whether it really did belong to John. John was told that he had to take part in Work for the Dole unless a medical certificate that he actually owned about his own illness prevented him. John did not obtain a medical certificate and did not return to the project as he had promised. A report was provided to Centrelink and John was breached.This government believes that we should have a fair but firm policy in relation to the commitments that we provide and the obligations we have to this nation's unemployed. We expect reciprocal obligations from those who take money from the public purse. Job Network and Work for the Dole are about assisting people back into work. This government will never apologise for throwing the book at those who do not do what is expected and required of them by the public. - Yes.</DOC>

 - Obviously, I cannot say whether or not performance bonuses were awarded, but that is something that we can take on notice. I will also investigate whether any performance bonuses were awarded in the four years of losses from 1989 to 1992 - unrealised losses. - They were actually currency swaps. They were both unrealised losses and negative economic returns. - No, the four years -   - I do not think he actually heard what I said. Between 1988 and 1991 there was not only four years of unrealised losses but a complete negative return. It was during 1985-86, before the swaps, when physicals were going on - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I have had the pleasure of travelling to the member's electorate -  - As I was saying, I have had the pleasure of travelling to the member for Grey's electorate and have seen first-hand both resources and industry in that electorate. The electorate of Grey is responsible for a very high volume of South Australia's exports and its industries include lead smelting, iron ore, steel, oil, gas, gemstones, slate, copper, silver, gold and uranium. In fact, the resources sector in South Australia employs some 12,000 people.As the Treasurer is apt to say in this House, Australia tends to defy the trends and we have done that not just in economic terms, where the economy has grown by some 4.1 per cent. Australia's resources companies have also defied the trends. Companies and their workers within the sector should be proud of their efforts. These efforts are shown through the latest ABARE statistics, which show that, during the December quarter, Australia had a very strong result in that sector, despite world trends. Minerals, including refined lead and zinc, recorded production improvements of some five per cent. Iron and steel exports recorded an improvement of some 18 per cent, or some $58 million. Lead earnings rose by 21 per cent to $192 million and diamond exports -  - I know how much you know about the sector! In terms of diamond exports, values increased by some $8 million, some five per cent over the previous quarter. I know those who sit opposite would be pleased to see that our strong resources sector means extra jobs in our community, particularly in our rural and regional communities. Not only do we earn significant income from our resources but also some $1.9 billion worth of mining and mineral processing equipment and technology and services to mining operations are exported annually. - I can go to page 3 if you want me to. Our resources sector is successfully adapting to the demands of a continuously competitive international environment and, along with the economic policies of this government, which have created a very conducive environment for investment through low interest rates and low inflation - and that would be new to the mining sector after the years of Labor - we have seen the work force continue to grow. Australia also continues to attract exploration and we are, based on Canadian figures, the No. 1 preferred destination for exploration, attracting some 17.5 per cent of global exploration. I know those who sit opposite do not want to hear good news. I know those who sit opposite prefer to think industry and resources are old economy. Our resources sector continues to grow, continues to defy the odds and continues to provide jobs and economic growth for Australia.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the shadow minister on his first question. I notice that his predecessor as shadow minister went some 250 question times without asking a question on the environment - I hope you are going to do a great deal better than that. The government's position is quite clear on the Townsville Trough and, indeed, any area outside the World Heritage area. That is, we will not allow any activity outside the World Heritage area which could damage the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef, and I have made that clear on many occasions. The Great Barrier Reef is better protected now than it has ever been, and it is better protected because of the legislation of this government. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act gives this government powers to protect the World Heritage area - powers which did not exist when the Labor Party was in office. The Labor Party's legislation did not provide for a minister to indicate that an action outside the World Heritage area could be a controlled action and be prevented if it damaged the reef.The shadow minister has shown a remarkable incapacity to understand the issues here or the legislation. I noticed that on Monday this week he called for a zoning plan to be put down under the EPBC Act to prevent mining outside the reef. Now there is in fact no provision in this legislation for a zoning plan. Zoning plans can be laid down by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority within the marine park, but the EPBC Act does not rely on zoning. It relies on the process under which an action is a controlled action, and the minister can require that certain things be done or not done by a company contemplating a controlled action.The shadow minister also on Monday, on the ABC, said that the opposition would agree with the government if the government were to come to a blanket ban on mining on the reef. Now of course mining is banned on the reef. Mining has been banned on the reef since 1975, yet the shadow minister appears not to understand this. The shadow minister has also asked me to override the legislation and not call for an environmental impact assessment, even though the legislation requires that such an environmental impact statement be provided. So it is quite clear that the current shadow minister has no understanding of the very powerful legislation which the government has put in place. The government is determined to protect the environment around the reef, and the World Heritage values of the reef will be fully guarded by this government's policy.</DOC>

 - The only poultry in this House are the turkeys on that side of the chamber! - I thank the member for Page for his question. I know he has a very keen interest in the wellbeing of seniors - along with the Minister for Family and Community Services, who made a very important announcement yesterday. More than four million Australians will start receiving pension increases next Wednesday. The maximum single rate of pension will rise by $11.30 to $421.80 a fortnight. The maximum partner pension will also increase by $9.50 to $352.10 a fortnight, for each member of a couple. These pension increases are greater than the rise in the cost of living, and that is because the coalition linked pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings as well as to inflation. This is something Labor promised to do but never delivered during its 13 years of power. During those 13 years of power, when Labor was in government, age pensions fell relative to average wages.Fortunately, and the member for Page knows this, we have reversed this situation, and there are real pension increases. In fact, the single pension has now increased by more than 20 per cent since 1996, going from $346 to $421. That is an increase of over $75 per fortnight, or nearly $2,000 per year. There is no doubt that hundreds of thousands of pensioners will also benefit from the fall in deeming rates that will also take place on 20 March from 3.5 per cent to three per cent. Members should know that Centrelink - and this is particularly for the new members on both sides of the House - uses the deeming rate to estimate pensioners' earnings from savings. The lower deeming rate normally means a greater entitlement to age pensions.  The member for Page asked if they were any alternative policies on this subject. It is hard to see how any of this could be bad news for our seniors but, somehow, the member for Lilley has managed to make this claim. The Treasurer did remind the House on Tuesday that the opposition leader was a hopin' and a wishin' and a thinkin' and a prayin' that Australia would go into recession. The member for Lilley goes one step further: he has given up waiting for bad news to jump onto; now he just invents it. Labor is quoted in today's Canberra Times as saying:Pensioners could be worse off, not richer, when they received a pay rise of up to $11.30 a fortnight.How do you get that?Pensioners could be worse off, not richer, when they received a pay rise of up to $11.30 a fortnight.In Wayne's world, the bigger your benefit increase, the worse off you become. In this fantasy world that he lives in, under this premise, the 9,676 pensioners in the electorate of Lilley are suffering because the coalition government is giving them more money. Think of the consequences of giving those 9,676 pensioners in Lilley more money. They might spend it with the local small businesses. It might even create more local jobs. Where would Labor's hope for recession be then? The fact is that the worst thing that can happen to Australian seniors and pensioners would be for the Australian Labor Party to get back into government, and the best example for pensioners is this graph. This represents six years of Labor and six years of coalition government. It is the coalition government that is looking after pensioners.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her maiden question. She certainly has a lot more interest than the previous member who was looking after this area, the member for Lilley. The facts are that child care has been one of the outstanding successes of the coalition government. Why is that? Because over the next four years, we will spend $6.7 billion on child care, which is a 36 per cent increase on what Labor ever spent in their last six years. Why is that? We are seeing utilisation rates now in child-care centres greater than they have ever been before. We have seen the cost of child care fall by over 13 per cent. - I think it is important that the shadow minister recognise that the affordability and the expansion of child care has never been greater. The question she raises regards child-care assistance, which was part of a payment structure before the introduction of the new taxation system. In the new taxation system we combined child-care assistance and child-care rebate into child-care benefit. Child care benefit has meant substantial increases to Australian families and to children right across the country. We said this back before July 2000, and notices were given to child-care centres -   - particularly about child-care assistance, because we advanced them two quarters, six months, to overcome that hump between the transition from the old child-care system to the new child-care system. They have had that total time to repay those debts. We have given them adequate notification. A whole litany of letters and correspondence has gone out to the child-care sector, particularly to those community based centres that may have had difficulty in coping.It has been a number of years since we gave those advances. I do not think it is unreasonable, as far as the Australian taxpayers are concerned, that they need to repay that debt. We have entered into arrangements with those child-care centres, if they so wished, as far as repayment schedules are concerned. We have been extremely reasonable, which was appropriate because the introduction of the child-care benefit perhaps caused some administrative transition problems, but the bottom line is that there are more children today than ever before using Commonwealth funded child care, whether it be in community based centres, long day care, outside school hours care, occasional care - the list goes on.It is a very good record and those centres have had every opportunity, through Centrelink, to come into some type of meaningful repayment schedule. It is regrettable that you should flame the fears within the child-care sector. One of the reasons child care has had substantial difficulty was because of the negative campaign that you and the previous shadow minister have raised about the affordability of child care before the introduction of child-care benefit. Child care is an outstanding success of this government.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for McPherson. It is astonishing to note that there have been recent reports suggesting that more than one million people in Britain have no understanding of the English language, which is double the estimate of some six years ago. Here in Australia, of course, we have had well-established programs that deal with the importance of building our nation by making sure that citizenship requires an understanding of basic English. It is also astonishing to note that this is another one of the areas about which those opposite showed absolutely no understanding in their policy development - which is a bit of an oxymoron - prior to the last federal election. They actually went into the last election campaign with no statement at all about important settlement services such as English language classes, no commitment to funding and nothing that even conceded that what had been done by my senior colleague, Minister Ruddock, in this area was in fact something that they endorsed. There was none of that. There was no commitment at all to anything.It is important to know that, unlike Great Britain, in this country we have had a very established process of settlement. We have ensured that language skills and knowledge about our society are an important part of the process that all people face. We believe that those who come to this country come here for the very best of reasons. They bring a range of skills and abilities, but often one of the key skills that is missing is an ability to communicate as well as they might in the English language. They have access to the 510 hours that we make available in the Howard government's Adult Migrant English Program, and some 30,000 clients participate in that program each year - with a client satisfaction rate of some 79 per cent who find that the AMEP has been very helpful or helpful and a further 17 per cent who find it a little helpful. We find that Great Britain is now looking at us for examples of what they should be doing. The coherent and cohesive society that we have built in Australia is a stand-out example to so many others in the world. In England they are looking very closely at our citizenship processes, and the way that people offer commitment and loyalty to this country when they become a citizen, as an example for them also for building something of a greater cohesion and a greater society than has been the case to date.So it is astonishing to know that one million people in Britain - more than double what it was six years ago - do not have a good understanding of the English language. That is something that is not going to be a problem here. In fact, we have taken it one step further in recent days with a pilot project at the point of embarkation, through areas of Asia and South-East Asia in particular, which encourages people who come from non-English speaking backgrounds to seek out the fully funded services that we have here and which meets our commitments at the last election - completely opposite to those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for the question. I am aware of the government strategy for ageing. One part of it is that the member for Grayndler should grow old in opposition - that is a very, very important element of it. I am confident that the proper practices were observed by the former minister and I think that the document repays a great deal of study. If there is to be any offset, it will be the 20 million bucks going out of Centenary House.</DOC>

 - What I have to say about the allegations against Justice Michael Kirby I have said in a news release that was issued this morning. As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday in question time, Justice Kirby enjoys a fine legal reputation in Australia. While I understand the reaction, particularly within the legal profession, to Senator Heffernan's allegations, there can at the same time be no credible suggestion that the High Court as an institution is under challenge. High Court judges have both the right and the ability to address any personal criticisms addressed against them. Justice Kirby, through a media release issued by the High Court yesterday, has responded to the claims made by Senator Heffernan in his speech to the Senate on Tuesday night. Other than that, I simply refer the member for Barton to what the Prime Minister said in answer to the first question yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question, and I know that this is an issue of considerable interest to members on both sides of the House. I note incidentally that two of our number in this place - namely, the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Curtin - are both in Zimbabwe as members of the Commonwealth observer group. I have noted, as no doubt other members have, the announcement last night that President Mugabe had secured 54 per cent of the valid votes cast and won the election. I am also aware, as honourable members will be, of widespread concerns on the elections already being expressed by some observer groups and diplomatic missions, as well as indications from the opposition in Zimbabwe that they may challenge the election process and the outcome in the courts.I expect to receive the Commonwealth observer group report on the election within the next few days, and that will be supplemented by assessments made by the four Australian observers - the three parliamentary ones and Mr Grey, the Chief Commonwealth Electoral Officer.Earlier today I spoke to the Commonwealth Secretary-General in London, Don McKinnon, and discussed the likely receipt date of the observers' report. I expressed the view that, until that report was received and assessed, it would not be appropriate for either me, President Mbeki of South Africa or President Obasanjo of Nigeria to express a definitive national view on whether or not the elections had been conducted in a free and fair manner. I note a comment attributed to President Mbeki, which I warmly welcome, to the effect that it would be incorrect to comment now on whether the elections in Zimbabwe were `free and fair'. I hope to be in touch with the Nigerian President and the South African President after the report has been received. Then we will agree on a procedure to assess that report and, if possible, to reach a conclusion.  Let me say this: I think I speak for everybody in the parliament when I say that it is a cardinal rule of the kind of society that the Commonwealth hopes to be that elections are conducted in a free, open and fair fashion. That will be a criterion of assessment that I will bring to my reaction to the report. I hope and believe that President Mbeki and President Obasanjo will do exactly the same thing, and I look forward to discussing the recommendations of that report with both of my fellow Commonwealth leaders.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I am aware of the latest statistics on employment. They are very, very encouraging news for the job seekers of Australia because they show that 950,000 new jobs have been created in the life of this government. Unemployment is down to 6.6 per cent. Trend employment is at an all-time high and the participation rate is at near record levels. What these figures, and other indicators, mean is that the job seekers of Australia can at the very least be cautiously optimistic abut their employment prospects in the months ahead. These figures reflect well on the economic policies of this government, but most of all they are a credit to the diligence and dependability of the Australian worker and the creativity and adaptability of Australian businesses. Governments and nations can never rest on their laurels over these matters. As a nation, we are always running for our economic lives. This government has an ongoing agenda for labour market and welfare reform which cannot be shirked if our children are to live in a First World country. Some elements of that agenda are currently in the Senate and I urge members opposite to be patriots, to stand up for Australia and not spoil us. I remind members opposite of the very wise words of the member for Hunter, who said about unfair dismissal laws:Well my wife constantly tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals.The member for Hunter might be helping in his wife's business at the moment as she cannot afford to put anyone on because of fear about the unfair dismissal laws! He further said that all those perceptions are out there; all of them are founded. If members opposite shared this government's commitment to creating jobs, they would pass the government's fair dismissal bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I have already informed the House that in the year 2001 Australia's growth rate was 4.1 per cent, which was 10 times the average of the OECD. According to the Economist's poll, Australia is forecast to have the highest growth in 2002, nearly double that of Great Britain which is expected to have the second highest, and the highest growth rate again in 2003. The performance of the Australian economy has come about at a time when the United States has been in recession along with Japan, Germany, Singapore and Taiwan. It is a testament, I believe, to the resilience of the Australian economy: the first home owners scheme, low interest rates, the sunny optimism of the Australian consumer and the confidence of our businesses.As has already been mentioned, today's labour force figures show that employment, which is normally a lagging indicator, seems to have picked up at least over the last two months. Let me give the House some comparisons. In the year to February, employment growth in Australia was 1.8 per cent. In the same period, in the United States, employment growth contracted by 1.7 per cent; in Japan, it contracted by 1.5 per cent; in France, it contracted by 1.4 per cent; and in Germany it contracted by 0.2 per cent. Britain grew by one per cent, which was a little over half the growth rate here in Australia. I consider the most interesting part about today's labour force is that when the January figures came out showing originally about 100,000 jobs - and not many of us believed those figures and I think I warned the House that we should expect a substantial revision, and there was - it was revised down to 63,000 which, if you believe that figure, was still the strongest, I think, recorded during the series. Notwithstanding a 63,000 increase in January, in February - when you would normally have expected a decrease, it actually held and improved on the January figures with another 20,000 new jobs created over and above the 63,000. This is now supported by ANZ job advertisements and by other indicators which indicate that there seems to be some confidence returning to the employment market. I am sure both sides of the House will welcome the fact that employment is growing and unemployment is falling. Over the period this government has been in office, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said before, a net new 950,000 jobs have been created - on average, 440 jobs a day. When the member for Fraser - who is yet to ask his first question on the economy as shadow Treasurer - was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the average job creation per day between 4 April 1990 and 24 March 1993 was negative 212 jobs - that is, 212 jobs a day were lost during that period when he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. So it is no wonder he has not asked any questions on either the economy or the labour force to date. But I think, in fairness, both sides of the parliament will welcome the fact that employment has grown and unemployment has fallen. Both sides of the parliament, I think, will welcome the fact that, after the huge tax reform that this government put in place in July 2000, not only has Australia grown but Australia has defied an international downturn and become the strongest growing economy in the world - something I believe that all Australians and both sides of the House will welcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I know he and all members on this side of the House are very proud of the work Australian steelworkers have done over recent years to improve the efficiency and the productivity of our steel industry. They produce high quality products at competitive prices. Members on this side of the House have been fighting for the steel industry in recent times in the teeth of an American decision to increase steel tariffs to 30 per cent.I can remind the House of what my colleague the Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister said some days ago, and that is that now up to 85 per cent of our steel exports to the United States will be preserved. That is not a perfect outcome, but that is an extraordinarily good outcome in the circumstances. It simply reflects on the strength of the lobbying by this government and the positive relationship that exists between Australia and the United States.I would have thought on an issue like this we, as a nation, would be united in our approach to helping Australian steelworkers. One of the most extraordinary revelations to me has been that officials from the Australian Workers Union have actually been taking the side of the United States on this issue, not the side of Australian steelworkers. The Victorian President of the AWU, Mr Mick Eagles - who, no doubt, is well known to many members on the other side of the House, some of whom are active members of the AWU -  -  - One of the interjectors, the member for Rankin, I know is proudly sponsored by the AWU. The Victorian state president of the AWU said of the American decision to increase steel tariffs: `Good on you, Yanks; we congratulate US steelworkers on these tariffs.' That was said by a leading figure, not a minor figure, in the AWU. The fact is that the AWU has been going to international meetings - in particular, the International Metals Federation meeting in Washington in 2000 - fighting for countries like the United States to impose steel tariffs.Geoff Cooney, an AWU organiser and a close colleague of the above, said Mick Eagles was at this meeting. This was a meeting where trade unionists resolved to stop exports of cheap steel to member states. We are one of the exporters of cheap and high quality steel to the United States, and there is the AWU going to the United States and encouraging the United States to put up tariffs against our steel. The fact is that there are many members of the Labor Party here who are affiliated with the AWU and who have not dissociated themselves from the AWU campaign against Australian steel tariffs.I noted that the member for Flinders the other day said that the original US decision was a betrayal of faith. The bigger betrayal of faith is the betrayal by the AWU leadership against the workers at Western Port and Port Kembla. I think all members of this House would agree that this was a disgrace, but it is part of a pattern of utter confusion on the part of the Labor Party on this issue. The two countries which were completely exempted from the US decision were Canada and Mexico, on the basis that they had a free trade agreement with the United States.On 7 March, the opposition spokesman on trade put out a press release in the context of the increased tariffs on Australian steel. He said:If Mr Howard follows the US down the road of exclusive, one-on-one trade deals, he abandons Australia's proud reputation as a global free-trader, and he abandons Australian exporters. To continue these FTA negotiations with the US while Australian steel makers are desperately trying to avoid job losses would be demeaning for Australia, and send the wrong signal internationally. The opposite is obviously true: that the countries that had an FTA with the United States got free access to the US market, and here is the Labor Party on the one hand, with some of its leading lights in the AWU, saying that the Americans were right to impose these tariffs, and on the other its shadow spokesman for trade is running around the place saying, `Abandon free trade negotiations with the US.' What, abandon them because it will be good for Australian steelworkers? The opposition spokesman's electorate is in the Illawarra, and the foolishness of his press release will I am sure go down very badly -  - with everybody except AWU organisers in the Illawarra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I regret to have to inform the House that I am aware of further disruptions to air transport in Australia. Yesterday I informed the House that unions associated with the provision of air traffic control services and with the work of air services generally, including Civil Air, the CPSU, the CEPU and the UFU, instituted strike action for four hours at Melbourne Airport. This occurred. It had a seriously disruptive effect. Around 40 per cent of the services into and out of Melbourne yesterday were, for some time, cancelled or not operated. There were disruptions all around Australia and in particular throughout southern Australia, which depends heavily on the Melbourne control centre to provide en route air traffic control services from that area. The most severe impact was on international, regional and charter operations. I believe that this was an irresponsible and selfish act on the part of the unions involved, one committed at a time when the aviation industry can least afford it. Notwithstanding this, the United Firefighters Union has indicated that it will be instituting industrial disruption at Melbourne Airport tomorrow and, again, I believe that this is totally unnecessary.The question has to be asked: what does Labor think of this? As I said yesterday, Labor and the unions have always said that they are very strong supporters of the Industrial Relations Commission. Commissioner Deegan has made it plain that this action is unnecessary, unwarranted and would in her words `have serious consequences,' and she recommended in the strongest language possible that they go back to work. The question has to be asked whether we have seen any leadership in this place from those opposite on this issue. I note that we have three former heads of the ACTU on the opposition front bench and on the opposition back bench. We have the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Batman and the member for Throsby. We would have hoped that they would have had some influence over the trade union movement but, no, they have had nothing to say - or at least I thought they had had nothing to say. Having expressed so much concern over the plight of airline employees in particular, I think it is worth noting for the benefit of the House that we did finally get a say last night from the member for Batman. He had something to say about the strike.  - Yes, a lot to say about me yesterday - very little of it to do with policy. Very personal, it was, not much to do with policy. But in relation to this strike -  - That is what a previous great leader of the Labor Party would have called a wet lettuce! -  - What the member for Batman did in the House yesterday was criticise me firstly because I `had the hide' to have a crack at air traffic controllers in question time and he went on to say it was because these people are prepared to stand up for their industrial rights. He supports the strike. He supports this industrial action despite the fact that the commission said that it is unwarranted, unnecessary and very strongly recommended that they go back to work. - What we got last night was a grubby and unjustified attack on one of the members - this is the other thing I wanted to raise - of the Aviation Reform Group, Dick Smith. I think this is worthy of comment because the member for Batman made out that there was some sort of conspiracy involved and that the Prime Minister and I had met with Dick Smith, which, as the Prime Minister will confirm, did not happen and has never happened. It is just a wild accusation. The member for Batman suggested that a dirty little deal was done for a coalition mate - that is what he said - because in the last election Mr Smith dared to publicly support the government.It is no secret that Mr Smith and I have had our differences, and nor is there any secret about Mr Smith's reason for backing the government's re-election. It was widely reported in the newspapers and Mr Smith repeated it on the radio. He said that he supported the government because, after the events of September 11, he felt the country needed strong leadership. He obviously did not believe the Labor Party could provide it.</DOC>

 - As is now well understood, the minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, recently announced in Canberra that the cabinet had decided to construct a permanent and purpose-built detention centre on Christmas Island. It was also decided at that cabinet meeting that propriety demanded, considering the unique circumstances of the people on that island, that I as the minister for territories should visit that island to give simultaneous advice to the people.That advice included my promise that to all extent practical local construction personnel on the island and the people of the island - particularly those in the underemployed sector, who happen to be primarily married women on the island - would be given priority in terms of employment once the particular facility was in operation. In that regard, I went as far as to discuss with the union, the Chamber of Commerce and others the appropriate training policies that might be implemented during the construction phase to make these people ready for that form of employment.I can report to the House that we first consulted with a public meeting of probably 150 people, who, with the exception of two people - and they identified themselves as one on one side of the political debate and one on the other and said they were opposed to such a centre - gave the centre very enthusiastic support. Having conducted that public meeting, I then had private meetings with the shire councillors, the Chamber of Commerce and the trade union.I am consequently very interested in those circumstances to have identified two other people who do not support this project, a project which could double the work force and the population of that island and give it some relief from its total reliance today on phosphate mining. You might be surprised to know that, considering the employment opportunities, the first person who is trying to undermine this process is the leader of the trade union movement on that island, Mr Gordon Thomson. The second is their local federal member of parliament, the member for Lingiari. - Furthermore, I have his press release. - I have in my hand a media release from the member for Lingiari - on it `contact Warren Snowdon' and a phone number. I challenge that member to point to one line in that that even says that he supports this project. It is a fundamental attempt to undermine this initiative to create jobs on Christmas Island, and he knows it. - I have only one other comment. This also attacks the fact, considering the distances involved, that I used a VIP aircraft to travel to the island. This criticism comes from a member of parliament who, as a parliamentary secretary, hired a VIP aircraft to go to a dog show. - </DOC>

 - The member for New England points to an issue of very real concern to members from all parties in this place. There is a meeting of ministers, which will be chaired by Senator Coonan - and I have every faith and confidence in her ability not only to chair that meeting effectively but also to lead some outcomes from that meeting. I certainly do not rule out for a moment involvement of myself and the premiers and chief ministers in this; I have an open mind on other approaches that might be adopted.While I am on my feet, can I say that I think this is quite a serious issue for our community. I think it challenges some of the conflicting assumptions of modern society - and one of them is that, unfortunately, we have become far too litigious a society. There are many things about the United States that I would like to see us copy, but one of the things I would not like to see Australia copy is their overindulgence in litigation. As a former member of the legal profession and still a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I lament the fact that the legal profession all around Australia some years ago abandoned some of the well-considered and time honoured rules of practice. I think the decision to allow lawyers to advertise was a disastrous mistake. I think the way in which many lawyers tout for personal accident business is a great pity, and I think everybody has to carry some of the blame.Some of the responses of the New South Wales government in particular in relation to this issue I compliment; I think the steps that they have taken in relation to the public hospitals are to be supported, and there are other measures that state governments can take. In the end, the problem of tort law reform is one that can only be tackled by the states. We can help, we can provide some leadership on it, but in the end they have the constitutional authority to reform the tortious laws of this country - and I hope that they examine those. But everybody carries a responsibility.I think we have to get a sense of perspective back into our lives. The idea that there should be an expectation of unlimited public accident coverage for a charitable event, against the possibility that somebody may be injured at that event, has brought a sense of unreality into our daily lives which I find quite appalling. I think one of the difficulties is that, because of the growth of this litigious mentality in our society, people's expectations have been ratcheted up, and we are all victims of it. I do not think there is one simple solution to this issue and there is not one simple level of government that can tackle the problem. I think we all have to work together. We have to scale our expectations down. We cannot simultaneously be a society that pursues individual rights and personal liberties to demented lengths but in the next breath expects to be able to conduct time-honoured charitable and volunteer activities without let or hindrance or any danger or threat of litigation. We cannot have it both ways, and society has got to decide where the balance is struck. Until it does that it is going to continue to grapple with this problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. He would well know that helping families has been a cornerstone of this coalition government since 1996. We make no bones about that because we think that the family is the fundamental unit of our society and it deserves help from government. That is why we cut personal income tax rates. That is why we introduced the family tax initiative. That is why we introduced the family tax benefit part A and part B. That is why we really believe that one of the things you can do to help families is to keep home mortgage interest rates low. When you think of how families were struggling when the Labor Party had interest rates at 17 per cent - how families were being torn apart by that kind of pressure - how much better are they off with an interest rate which is six per cent and with a First Home Owners Scheme for young families to be able to take part in the Australian dream. This morning, we introduced legislation to deliver in full the promise that we made in the election campaign of the first child tax refund, otherwise known as the baby bonus. As the father of twins and expecting another, I am sure that the member for Sturt is very interested in the baby bonus. It will apply to a child born after 1 July 2001 - or, if you already have children, your first child born after 1 July 2001 - Prime Minister. - Did you say thank you? - The member for Prospect asks, `How about people in the community who need the money?' We actually think mothers with children do need the money. We actually think helping families is a good thing. - I suppose that there is nothing that would better illustrate the difference between Labor and the coalition than an interjection like that, suggesting that mothers with young children do not need help - they do. - This is something that goes to the women of Australia. - This is available to the women of Australia - particularly those that have to go out of the work force and decide to stay at home and to bring up children - who, if they had been able to average their income over five years, would pay much less tax and, under the past tax administration, have not been able to take the advantage of that averaging system. Under this they can. They can claim back up to $2,500 per annum for five years in relation to their tax liabilities. Those that are not high-income earners get a guaranteed minimum of $500 in relation to that child - notwithstanding their tax position; even if they had not paid any tax before having their children - to help with the costs in relation to the children.You can say, `Well, $500 is obviously not the full cost of raising a child,' but it is the first time that a government has introduced a scheme like this, and it is certainly an advance on what was there before, because before there was no capacity to do this and to claim back your income tax or to be guaranteed the minimum payment. If the mother decides to go back into the work force, the benefit can be transferred to the father if the father stays at home and goes out of the work force as well. In addition to this, it will also be payable to children under five years of age who have been adopted. This is a policy to help families. This is a policy to do justice in relation to the tax system to working mothers who go out of the work force in order to look after their children. This is pro-family. This was put down as the centrepiece of the government's election platform. This was introduced today - it is on time, it is on budget, it is another promise delivered, it is something for the families of Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It might assist the House if I can provide a few facts about MRI services in Western Australia. There are six Medicare eligible MRI units located in the Perth metropolitan area. A number of those are, in fact, quite close to the Princess Margaret hospital. Indeed, Perth has the second highest ratio of MRI services to population of all capital cities in Australia.Secondly, there is absolutely no impediment on the Western Australian state government providing MRI services at Princess Margaret hospital. The Commonwealth government has fulfilled its responsibility and has provided MRI services in Perth, close to the location that the honourable member refers to and at a higher ratio than any other capital city in Australia, except one. If the Western Australian minister, Mr Kucera, would like to provide some additional services from the funding which comes to him for health from the Commonwealth government, then he is quite able to do so. Instead of whipping up this ludicrous fear campaign, I call upon Mr Kucera to provide the service himself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I note his real interest in rail. He was one of quite a number of people from the parliament who attended the dinner last night in Canberra as a guest of the Australasian Rail Association. I note quite a number of their members in the gallery today. I trust they have enjoyed the experience of watching question time.There are significant advantages from the sale of NR and FreightCorp to the National Rail Consortium, made up by Toll and Patrick. In general terms I would say, as I have said here before, that we need rail reform and we need it urgently in this country. I would go so far as to say that it is now very late in the day, and if we are to secure a future for rail it has to be able to compete with road. It has not been able to in recent years, because essentially I think the model has been wrong. Governments have tried to run rail, and governments are not very good at running commercial exercises of that nature - unlike the trucking sector, which has been run by the private sector, where you have seen competitive pressures, the uptake of technology, and the constant improvement in efficiencies and productivity. We have not seen the same thing in rail. Yet, given rail's essential advantages in environmental terms and fuel usage terms and so forth, this is an outcome that the Australian economy cannot afford.We are now moving to a situation where governments are out of the business of operating freight trains and rolling stock, but are still owning and retaining tracks, upgrading those and controlling access in the same way that we do with roads - but then allowing the private sector to do it above rail. I very much welcome the consortium that has bought NR and FreightCorp for a very substantial amount of money. That in itself is a substantial capital injection for rail. They have promised a further injection of private sector capital if we can get the management regime right. That is the next issue. As I said in my presentation last night, if you look at what we have been able to achieve on the east-west corridor across the Nullarbor, rail now has 80 per cent of the freight, the transit times are coming down, the cost is coming down and it is a great success story. On the north-south corridor - Melbourne to Brisbane and points between and beyond - rail only has about 10 to 12 per cent of the freight, and it is continuing to lose out to road. The next big building block, then, following the sale of NR and FreightCorp is to secure a satisfactory interstate access arrangement for the Australian Rail Track Corporation of the New South Wales part of the interstate track. Then we can put a management structure in place which will recognise, as roads do, the fact that we are a national economy and not a state based one. I think this is an incredibly important next step, if it can be secured.I urge the New South Wales government - we are negotiating with them in good spirit at the moment on sensible grounds - to help us wrap that up. I urge those who are worried about their future in rail in that state to recognise that without reform there will not be a rail industry of any size in this country to work in. We have got to reform it - we have got to get it competitive with road to build a bigger rail industry. Roads will never compete and never cope with the freight task in the future; governments will never cope with the bills for upgrading the roads; and cities will never cope with the congestion on the east coast unless we get it right for rail. There will not be any jobs in it, anyway, because it will die. So this is a very important next step. I thank the honourable member for his question and I thank the ARA for their support for our endeavours. I think that, with cooperation and goodwill, in the next few months we can do what so many people in this place have wanted to do for so long - secure the future of rail.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, in my capacity as representing the minister for communications, I wish to provide the House with a very considered response to this question because there has been a tragic accident. I wish to express my sympathy and that of the government - and, indeed, the parliament - to the Boulding family. The independent regulator, the Australian Communications Authority, has formally investigated and reported on this matter and the government's initial response has also been released.The investigation by the ACA shows that, whilst Telstra met its obligations under the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee, a number of its internal policies and systems were deficient when it came to providing service to people with priority health needs. As a consequence, the government will be imposing a licence condition on Telstra to minimise absolutely the chances of a repeat of the recent tragedy affecting the Boulding family.The licence condition will require Telstra to fully inform both existing and new customers of their right to priority services in emergency health situations; provide clear assessment criteria and processes to be put in place to ensure that all Telstra customers with a genuine life-threatening health emergency have access to priority services; ensure a continuous phone service to the maximum extent possible for all priority customers - this will include providing a temporary phone service within 24 hours of notification, or 48 hours within remote areas, in the event that a connection or repair cannot be completed in that time frame - and provide a high priority for full rectification of a priority phone service, if it has two or more faults within a three-month period; and support and advice for customers about putting in place a reliable backup service. The licence condition will also require Telstra to report back to the government within one month on how it will upgrade its systems and processes to ensure that it meets all its obligations to priority service customers. Telstra will also be required to improve its processes for managing disruptions of this kind under the customer service guarantee regime. As part of its response to the Besley inquiry, the government asked the ACA to develop a network reliability framework for Telstra as the primary universal service provider. The ACA was asked to reconsider this framework following Sam Boulding's death. The ACA is finalising a multitiered framework to enhance Telstra's service reliability which includes: requiring reliability reporting on large service areas; requiring monitoring of smaller service areas to identify and fix network problems at a highly disaggregated level; as well as requiring monitoring and immediate fixing of individual services that do not meet an adequate level of reliability.In summary, the government is determined - as is the parliament - that all Australians will have adequate phone services, particularly those in highest need. The government would wish to once again extend its sympathy to the Boulding family and we thank them for their cooperation with the ACA during its investigation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her very keen interest in the welfare of the tourism industry. It is a very significant industry in her electorate, as it is throughout the whole of Queensland and, in fact, in a number of other electorates around Australia as well.The government warmly welcomes the investment by Patrick Corporation in Virgin Blue, obtaining 50 per cent of the company. It is very positive for the tourism industry for a number of reasons. Firstly, we warmly welcome more choice in aviation in Australia. We welcome more planes on more routes including, importantly, more regional destinations. The most significant impact of Virgin Blue's expansion in Australia is that it is providing a service - a low-cost, low-fare service - to many Australians who in other circumstances may not be able to afford to travel. So it is actually opening up a very important and prospectively large part of the tourism industry in Australia.The government stands prepared to help to expand the tourism industry in Australia. Our most significant inbound market is New Zealand. More than 700,000 New Zealanders visit Australia each year - some come over for the rugby, some come over for the cricket and I am sure they will be coming over for the Rugby World Cup now that it is being held in Australia. Over 90 per cent of the New Zealanders that visit Australia have, in fact, visited Australia before. - Overwhelmingly, a large number of them go back to the same place that they have already been. So I am pleased to advise the House that the government has launched a program of $800,000 in television advertising in New Zealand - as well as other marketing devices - to expand the market -  - and to tell New Zealanders about the great outback and the member for Dawson's electorate - the Great Barrier Reef and the beautiful Whitsundays. The opportunity is available to go and target an important sustainable market for the Australian tourism industry. - The government, in partnership with the aviation industry and the tourism industry, will continue to look at all opportunities to expand the pie and grow the opportunities for the tourism industry in Australia.</DOC>

 - What I can say about aged care beds is that when this coalition came to government we were facing a shortage of 10,000 beds left by you when you were in government and reported by the Auditor-General when we came to government. You set yourselves -  - The Australian Labor Party -  - Yes, the Australian Labor Party set a benchmark for beds in 1986 that, when it left government in 1996, it had still failed to achieve. What we have done in two terms of government - and this is one of the great success stories of this government - is to increase the funding to aged care from $2.5 billion to $4.2 billion. Not only that -  - Unlike the ALP, we promised and made an election commitment in November last year that we will increase places to 200,000 by 2006. That is a real commitment to aged care and something which you are incapable of doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his enthusiastic question. The member for Moore raises the issue of the proposed workplace relations changes in Western Australia and their implications for small business. It will not be news to this House that the proposed bill will strangle small businesses, including the small businesses in his electorate of Moore. As one example of the proposed changes, under the proposals the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be given new powers to force a third party, such as a contractor, to abide by the unfair dismissal laws. For example, if one of the pubs in the electorate of Moore engages pub security through a labour hire firm, it is unhappy with the quality or the activity of the security, and it asks to have those people removed, the Western Australian Industrial Relations Comission can order the pub to employ that security directly whilst the unfair dismissal claim is being considered. It is like ordering a third party to employ someone if they have an unfair dismissal claim in progress. The Labor Party often says that the unfair dismissal laws do not have any implication for business. If you want to know what the Labor Party really stands for, the current unfair dismissal laws do affect small business, and the proposals in Western Australia are a taste of what the Australian Labor Party would do in government. I asked the restaurant and catering association to give me a rundown of some of the examples of the impact of the current unfair dismissal laws - the same laws the Labor Party will not let us change to help to protect small business. They gave me the example of a restaurant in the inner city. That restaurant had an unfair dismissal claim made against it even though the company had not terminated the employee. Even though there are threatened dismissal provisions under the act, this employee had received notice that a redundancy had to take place for financial reasons. The kitchen in the restaurant was overstaffed, so the company was going through the consultation process. The claim was lodged to forestall the redundancy process legitimately being undertaken by the restaurant.I give another example: in the Hunter region in New South Wales, a company terminated an employee after several memos outlining the unacceptability of their performance. It necessitated at least three visits to Newcastle for the pretrial matters and a hearing of one day. The restaurant is at the outskirts of the region. It necessitated similar trips to the commission at Newcastle by the member. It also required an advocate to go to the establishment from Sydney to take evidence from the witnesses.In 100 per cent of the cases recognised by the restaurant and caterers association, the threat of unfair dismissal had changed the way in which the operators managed staff. Forty-six per cent said that it would stop them hiring staff, and 70 per cent said it would encourage them to hire casual over permanent staff -  - I am pleased to table all the examples and further evidence of the fact that the unfair dismissal laws which the Labor Party put into place and which are having an impact on jobs, the unfair dismissal laws which the Labor Party seeks to protect, are costing jobs in small business. If we want to know what the Labor Party does in government, have a look at what is happening in Western Australia in the electorate of Moore, in the electorate of Stirling and in all the other electorates in Western Australia, because at the end of the day the Labor Party is opposed to jobs and it is opposed to small business jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can indicate that I have no first-hand or direct knowledge of freedom of information requests in relation to Comcar records. I obviously have seen it in the press that Senator Heffernan had made an application in relation to Comcar records. I am only going on press reports which may or may not be accurate, and from what was said in the press he made an application which was treated in accordance with the rules, as I would expect Comcar to do and I would expect those concerned to do, in accordance with the freedom of information legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a very important issue; it goes to the efficiency of our export transport facilitation in this country, and that is very important for Australian jobs. Mr Speaker, the Labor Party, of course, would have had you believe that they had cleaned up the waterfront. The union movement not only would have had you believe but actually were very fond of telling us that you could not improve waterfront efficiency in Australia - that it was impossible in Australia to reach the targets set by the government of an average number of container movements across the nation of 25 containers per hour. For the fifth successive quarter, the government's benchmark of 25 containers per hour has been consistently achieved. When we came to power, the average crane rate movement was 16.9 containers an hour. In December of 2000, that rose to 25½. In March 2001, we had 26.4 containers an hour; 26.8 containers per hour in the June quarter of last year; 25.8 containers per hour in the September quarter last year; and 26.3 containers per hour in December 2001.We consistently showed strength and leadership on this issue, and we did so in the national interest. This is in stark contrast to the ALP's lack of leadership on issues relating to the waterfront specifically but more generally to the role of the trade union movement in the Australian economy. If we look at the current Leader of the Opposition, one of three ex-ACTU heads in this place, we find a consistent inability to show any direction at all on matters pertaining to industrial relations. Last week, for example, we had air services staff out on strike. The Leader of the Opposition remained silent while the shadow spokesman for transport made it plain that he fully supported the workers' right to strike, despite the fact that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had made it quite plain that that strike was superfluous and that the parties ought to immediately start negotiating again. Indeed, if the union movement constitutes the holding company for the ACTU, the shareholders are plainly restless. They are looking for a return on their investment and they are looking to the board and the director in particular to take some decisions - any decisions - to take some policy courage and to define where it is that they are going, but they cannot get what they need. Consequently they are withdrawing their investment - they are walking away.I can only conclude by saying that the question has to be asked: what would it say about leadership in this country if the waterfront were still being run by the ACTU and by the union movement and the Labor Party, and we had container movements stuck at under 17 movements per hour on average across the country? This has been an example of strong leadership by the government, delivering for the Australian people, and in particular for the export sector. It is about time that the union movement got a bit of return on their investment and some direction from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Last week, Senator Heffernan made certain allegations against Justice Kirby - a justice of the High Court - in the Senate. He relied, in making those allegations, on what he believed to be a record of Comcar pick-ups and deliveries. He has come to the conclusion that that record was a fabrication. Accordingly, the Prime Minister has dismissed Senator Heffernan as his parliamentary secretary and in addition to that the Prime Minister has asked Senator Heffernan to give an unqualified apology to the judge. I think people on both sides of the House would think that is the right thing to do. The Prime Minister has asked Senator Heffernan to give an unqualified apology and I think people on both sides of this House would consider that the appropriate thing to do.The Senate began sitting, as I understand it, at 2 o'clock - at about the same time as the House began sitting - and so as yet Senator Heffernan has not given such an unreserved apology. But it is my belief that he will be doing so. It is certainly my expectation that he owes to the judge such an unqualified apology and that he should withdraw those allegations in light of the fact that he himself has now concluded that the evidence on which he relied was fabricated.I think the appropriate thing in the circumstances is for that apology to be given and for those on both sides of the House to assess it. I hope in the circumstances that the judge will accept it. I know that with these sorts of things it is always going to be very difficult to right the wrong which has been done to the judge in respect of those allegations. But the first and the most important thing in an effort to right the wrongs in relation to those allegations is that a full apology - an unreserved apology - be given.Coming to the question as to what the secretary of the finance department did or did not do, I have no reason to believe that the secretary of the finance department would have acted otherwise than in accordance with his statutory responsibilities. The important thing here is that this record did not appear as a result of a freedom of information request because, as those of us who have read the press know - and this is what you are going on - that request was denied. Whatever the source of that particular record, it is false. Senator Heffernan accepts that it is false and accordingly he is giving an unqualified apology, which is the right thing to do in the circumstances. It would be better if the allegations had not been made; let us make that clear. But the right thing to do in the circumstances is to give an unqualified apology and I certainly expect that Senator Heffernan will do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that the final statement of private new capital expenditure was released today and it confirmed what we had seen in the preliminary figures: that business investment intentions in Australia are very strong. That is good news, because it means that business is feeling confident and, because it is investing, that means that over time businesses will grow and more people will be in work. And we had some good unemployment figures last week.The results of the survey show that new capital expenditure increased 8.3 per cent in the December quarter and 3.9 per cent over the year to December. But perhaps even more significant were the survey intentions for 2002-03, which were for an estimated expenditure in the forthcoming financial year which was 21.2 per cent above the estimate for the financial year which we are currently in - an expectation of a 21.2 per cent increase in relation to capital expenditure over the course of the year.In the midst of a world downturn, what could be giving great heart and confidence to Australian business? Consumer spending is strong, and that is good for business. Interest rates are low, and that is good for families. In addition to that, the new tax system put more money in people's pockets by cutting their income taxes. The other thing that has contributed in relation to business investment is that now under the new tax system there are no embedded costs in any plant and machinery which is purchased by business. They get the full rebate of GST of all embedded costs back when they buy plant and equipment. So the new tax system has been good for consumers and it has been good for business. Notwithstanding all of the prognostications from the Labor Party, who gleefully predicted that the new tax system would lead to recession or worse, the Australian economy in 2001 shrugged off a world downturn, grew and became the strongest growing of the major industrialised economies in the world.Are there any alternative policies? We took great amusement in seeing the Leader of the Opposition say he is going to review all Labor policies. That is funny. You would have to look carefully to find something to review! We were not aware that there were any Labor Party policies. You have to get out the biggest microscope the world has seen to review a Labor policy! You would probably have to have a finder's fee before you could actually engage in reviewing an Australian Labor Party policy. There has been a very interesting discussion - and, I think, quite a good discussion - from some of the people that are now resigning from the Australian Labor Party in disaffection at its leadership and its lack of values. Leigh Hubbard wrote in the Age newspaper today. He noted:In the 2001 federal election the ALP recorded its lowest primary vote in 70 years. The party simply doesn't attract or inspire the activists who would have once seen it as the first step in their political lives. For the ALP there is a crisis of core values, of knowing what it stands for ...I think Leigh Hubbard was right - there is a crisis in the ALP of not knowing what it stands for. How can we possibly know what your policies are when you yourselves do not know what your policies are? This is a party which for six years has been in opposition and is yet to come up with a single policy after six years. Now it has announced that the two great policies that it mentioned in the last parliament - roll-back and `noodle nation' - are both under review. They are both under review because the Labor Party stands for nothing, believes in nothing, has no position on anything and does not offer anything at all to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - As I said quite plainly in answer to the last question, Senator Heffernan accepts that that is a false document and a fabrication and the Prime Minister, after being informed to the same effect, took what I consider to be the sensible and the right action: he dismissed Senator Heffernan as a parliamentary secretary and he required Senator Heffernan to give an unqualified apology. As to the source of that, that will be a matter for investigation by the Minister for Justice and Customs. The minister for justice no doubt will ensure that that is investigated in accordance with law. I will give no such undertaking to report back to the House on Thursday, because the minister for justice will be doing this in accordance with his obligations - not to the convenience of the Labor Party's political timetable.</DOC>

 - While members opposite engage in trivial muckraking, this government is getting on with doing the right thing by the people of Australia. I am pleased to say that this government has delivered freedom, fairness and prosperity to the good working people of this country. No fewer than 950,000 new jobs have come into existence under this government; employment is at an all-time high; participation is at new record levels; and the job seekers of Australia can look for work with new hope and confidence. Thanks to the policies of this government, basic award earnings are up by five per cent in real terms since 1996, after actually falling by five per cent between 1983 and 1996. This government has delivered the quadrella to the working people of Australia: more jobs, higher pay, lower taxes and fewer strikes. That is the kind of result that the working people of Australia deserve, and we can do this because we know where we stand and we are led by someone who has vision and is not just a mere fixer.The problem with members opposite is that they do not know where they stand. The problem is that Labor people do not know where Labor people stand. The secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council has said that a lot of people are re-evaluating membership - that is to say membership of the Labor Party - simply because people have started to say, `Well, what does the Labor Party stand for?' The leader of the most powerful union in the country has said, `Working people are looking for a party that boldly and unashamedly speaks for them.' Then he said, `The Labor Party is not that party currently.' Then no lesser person than the member for Melbourne said, `The central issue is not merely our policies; it is us.' That is what the member for Melbourne said about the Labor Party.At a time when the Australian Labor Party is facing possibly its gravest crisis in nearly 50 years, for the last four weeks all the Leader of the Opposition can do is come into this House and waste the parliament's time and keep endlessly reiterating some version of when did you know, what did you know and when did you know it? The good, decent people of this country know that it is not good enough; they are already looking at the colleagues of the Leader of the Opposition, people like the member for Jagajaga and the member for Werriwa. They are already looking at them, and they see that the Leader of the Opposition is wanting in comparison. If he does not lift his game, he will not keep his job.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and I know that the member has taken a great deal of interest in and worked with the government on this whole issue of tariffs on Australian steel that have been applied by the US administration. I inform the House that, following on from the work that the government and industry have been doing in terms of achieving an outcome that will see 85 per cent of Australia's exports enter the US market without the burden of tariffs, we undertook to conduct a meeting at the earliest opportunity to address the issues that have been raised with the key players involved in the steel industry. Along with my colleagues, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and the Minister for Justice and Customs, in attendance at the meeting this morning we had representatives from industry - from the exporters BHP, OneSteel and Smorgon, the Australian industry group - and, interestingly, we also had a very constructive contribution from the trade union movement across Australia - we had representatives from the ACTU, the AMWU and the AWU, which was obviously a colourful discussion at times.All acknowledged the very good outcome that the government has achieved so far in the security of 85 per cent of our exports to the United States, because that goes a long way to securing the jobs of Australians working in the steel industry. The steel summit, that was conducted this morning, recommended that government should establish a ministerial task force with a monitoring group within that task force to review the capacity of Australia's antidumping laws, to defend local businesses from subsidised steel imports and to ensure that displaced product - as a result of this decision in the United States that is going to be moving around the global marketplace - does not affect the Australian industry unnecessarily in the domestic marketplace.We agreed that we should continue to work constructively together with the parties involved in this, led by the government and this ministerial task force, to review and to continue to monitor what possible challenges are going to confront the industry in the short term and in the longer term over the next three years whilst this is being implemented. Of course, there was an agreement that we should completely reserve our rights as far as our WTO options are concerned on the remaining 15 per cent. Our government has acted very quickly in that regard. The first measure under the safeguards action that we have been able to implement is that by the end of this week we will have consultations with our American counterparts on the remaining exports that are going to be impacted upon by this decision.So it is quite clear that the government has taken a lead role and has acted very quickly and very successfully. In an answer to a question asked last week, we compared this with the ability of the Labor Party to deal with a similar circumstance with Australia's wheat industry when an export enhancement program was implemented when they were in government. What they were unable to do as far as the Australian wheat industry is concerned we have been able to achieve for the Australian steel industry. We want to continue to work beyond what we have achieved so far, to achieve more and to ensure that we come out at the other end of this process with a stronger steel industry and with all of those steel jobs that exist today intact. There was agreement amongst all of those people - government, industry and unions - today to work to that common goal. Of course there are issues on which we disagree with some of the industry members and some of the union members with regard to our trade policy and our trade agenda. But it was interesting to note the contribution of the Labor Party on policy and on this whole steel issue, which has been going on without any involvement from the Labor Party over the last six months. It was a stunt by members of the Labor Party to arrive unannounced and uninvited at the meeting this morning, with television cameras following closely behind. It was a bit reminiscent of that infamous exercise a few years ago -  - when we had people breaking down the front doors of this building or when the unions broke into Skilled Engineering in Victoria and did $100,000 worth of damage. - Our government is interested in positive outcomes for this industry and for the workers whose jobs and livelihoods rely on our exports and on this industry. We are focused on positive outcomes, not just cheap political stunts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. In particular, I appreciate the sound choice of the people of Moncrieff in sending a member to Canberra who is prepared to stand up and fight for the rights of parents to be able to choose the kind of schooling that they think is best to meet the educational aspirations that they have for their children.I am asked about alternative policies. In fact, it is reassuring that the member for Moncrieff has asked me the question because I was not expecting to get one from the member for Jagajaga. This would not surprise honourable members, because when you go to the web site it says:Welcome to Jennymacklin.net. This website is currently under construction ...a CFMEU project, I suspect! I am sorry to report that the 58 non-government schools are still waiting for the money that is owed to them because the Australian Labor Party cannot decide whether or not it wants to pass this legislation. In the meantime, there are 4,900 children, their families and the communities in which these schools are based - more than two-thirds of them in some of the poorest parts of Australia - who are still waiting for their money, and they have been waiting for a whole year. The Labor Party has declined to pass this legislation now on two occasions.Senator Kim Carr is supposedly the opposition education spokesman in the Senate, and he is also the shadow spokesman for science. His approach to this, I must say, is puzzling to say the least. I offered Senator Carr a briefing from my department. I said to my department, `Senator Carr will want to bring the social justice truck down to the department. I want you to do everything you possibly can to give him all of the information that he needs that will enable the Labor Party in the Senate to pass this legislation.' Instead, he said, `Oh, no, I just want to go into the Senate and debate the bill.' So it is an interesting situation where you have someone who purports to speak for the Labor Party in the area of science and who does not even want to know the facts. `Don't confuse me with the facts,' he says. I think there are some facts that need to be heard. These schools and their families deserve to hear some of the facts. I know that Ben from Bentleigh, in the office of the Leader of the Opposition, is waiting to get some facts. The member for Blaxland, for example, might be interested to know that the Holy Saviour School - and I think they are praying for Ben to get his act together and get the Leader of the Opposition to support this - and 75 families are waiting for over $30,000. I do not know what you are telling them. I would also like to know what Senator Ludwig in the Senate thinks about the 13 schools in Queensland that are owed more than $421,000, including St Andrews Catholic College in the electorate of Leichhardt. The St Andrews Catholic College is owed $21,750 - for 81 children and their struggling families.Again, the member for Fisher rang me at the weekend and spoke to me at length about the problem that the Pacific Lutheran College have got. They have had to forgo a staff member because they cannot get $50,000, which is denied to this school by the Labor Party. The Parklands Christian College in the electorate of Moreton, in Park Ridge, is owed nearly $15,000. The only reason this school is operating is that it has had to borrow money from another Christian school. Eleven schools in New South Wales, $23,000 denied because of the Australian Labor Party; 11 schools in Victoria, $163,000 denied; 13 in Western Australia - including 25 families at the Nyikina Mangala Aboriginal Community School in Derby - owed more than $481,000; and six schools in South Australia owed more than $232,000.The Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Leigh Hubbard, has today given some advice to the Leader of the Opposition. He says:Simon Crean keeps talking about modernising the party and its relationship with the unions, but what does this really mean? Surely, many of the disaffected actually want to see the party become relevant rather than modern.Senator Carr and the Labor Party in the Senate need to understand that you can be both modern and relevant. For example, Bill Daniels, the Executive Director of the National Council of Independent Schools Association - on behalf of all families, I am sure, and for the one million children in non-government schools and their parents and extended families - says:During the election campaign the Labor Party made it clear that it intended to pass the legislation to enable establishment grants payments to be made to those schools awaiting payments.He further said that Mr Beazley said:Non-government schools will also benefit from Labor's policy to pay establishment grants to new non-government schools.And Mr Daniels says, on behalf of those families:It is disappointing to see that the ALP has modified its position since the election and has done so without any consultation with the independent schools sector.In concluding, the member for Dawson last year very helpfully pointed out that the Labor Party are like cattle dogs on the back of a flat tray or a ute and the slightest distraction has them all running from one side of the ute to the other, barking in support of whatever issue has got their attention on the day. But in relation to this issue, I have an idea that the red -  - Mr Speaker, I have a feeling that on this particular issue, the red cattle dogs are on one side of the truck, the blue cattle dogs are on the other side of the truck and Ben from Bentleigh is in the middle trying to get the red ones over to the blue side. The Labor Party need to think of the families that are being denied critically needed funding for establishment grants for non-government schools and the Leader of the Opposition should instruct Senator Carr and his Senate colleagues to pass the legislation.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is desperately trying to establish some complicity between Senator Heffernan and members of the government in this matter.

 - I would like to thank the member for Forrest for his interest in small businesses and particularly his interest in the businesses in Western Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has, only today, released a very comprehensive report about the characteristics of small business. I can inform the House that, according to the survey, almost half of Australia's 1.2 million small businesses have been started under the Howard government. That is a massive growth over previous periods. - It indicates how small businesses react to a strong economy, to low interest rates and to employment growth. Since the last survey in November 1999, the number of small businesses has grown by 11 per cent, whereas previously it had grown by three per cent. Interestingly, now more than 25 per cent - one in four - small businesses in Australia are run by women and the fastest growth in the small business sector is, in fact, young women under the age of 30 starting up their own small business. - There are now 1.2 million small businesses in Australia contributing to our economic growth and there are 1.2 million reasons why the Labor Party has to treat the government's fair dismissal bill fairly. The 116,000 small businesses in Western Australia are facing one of their greatest challenges. It is the Gallop government's proposal for industrial relations reform, which is effectively being drafted by the unions. It has been put in place for the unions and it does all the small businesses in Western Australia in the eye. In this place, I have reiterated the large number of pecuniary sections of that bill which are going to have a significant impact on small business. But I can add a further one today: it is a provision that effectively allows a union representative to walk into any workplace to speak to any person who is now eligible to join a union. What does that mean for a small business when its two sole workers are forced to down tools because a union heavy walks in for a quiet word? We effectively have the Western Australian Labor Party and the unions running roughshod over small business in Western Australia. We have the Victorian unions turning over a new leaf, I understand, and turning their backs on the Leader of the Opposition and on the Labor Party. We have the member for Melbourne and the member for Griffith who are in there, apparently, batting against the unions and the unions are driving a wedge into the Labor Party through there. The Labor Party is not a political party; it hasn't got leadership. It is more like a Hydra - it has many heads. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is using a butter knife to cut them off.</DOC>

 - The question, of course, is based on a fundamentally false premise, which is that nobody gave a sanction for Senator Heffernan to proceed. You asked the question, `Why was Senator Heffernan allowed to proceed?' As the Prime Minister has made clear, the Prime Minister was not given advance notice, nor did he sanction -  - the speech by Senator Heffernan. As a consequence, after the speech was given, in fact, Senator Heffernan was required to stand aside. I would have thought that was very clear evidence that the Prime Minister did not condone; nor did he authorise; nor was he given advance notice. That is why he was forced to stand aside. When it became clear that the record that he relied on was false and a fabrication, the Prime Minister went further and required his resignation and, what is more, an unqualified apology. As I have said, it is entirely clear - and this is what the Prime Minister made clear when he was asked directly - that he was given no advance notice; he did not encourage the senator to do it; he was not told it was going to be done, and that is the reason why Senator Heffernan was asked to stand aside and was eventually dismissed. So it is piling a false assumption upon a question to try and ask with some kind of insinuation that the Prime Minister knew about it. He did not. He has made that clear and I think it is perfectly clear to everybody in this House, as it should be to you.</DOC>

 - I am aware that ever since the last election a war has been raging inside the Australian Labor Party between those who believe that Labor should be a democratic party based on the principle of `one vote one value' - people like the member for Werriwa, the member for Barton and the member for Fremantle - and people, on the other hand, who think that the Labor Party should be the Siamese twin of the ACTU, like the member for Batman and Senators Hutchins and Campbell. The one thread uniting both sides of this civil war inside the Labor Party is dismay at the lack of leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, who does not know where he stands and is completely incapable of imposing his will on his squabbling subordinates. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition says:... the influence of trade unions necessarily has to wane.And then he goes before a different audience and says:I cannot envisage a Labor Party that operates free from the trade union movement.Then, of course, having been constantly embarrassed he then tries to gag debate by saying:These debates should ... be held internally.On the weekend, in a spectacular and brazen act of defiance by the Leader of the Opposition, no less a person than the frontbench member for Melbourne leaks the whole of his paper to the Wran-Hawke committee of inquiry in which he says that the biggest problem in Australia today is that people do not know where the Labor Party stands and that the place is dominated by ex-trade union officials. This, naturally enough, prompted a counterattack from the leader of the biggest and most militant trade union in the country, Doug Cameron, who is similarly dismayed by the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition and who says that the Leader of the Opposition is:... spooked and bullied by Tony Abbott and John Howard. - That is right: why not the Treasurer as well? I do not actually believe that the Leader of the Opposition is spooked and bullied by me or by the Prime Minister. I do not think he is even spooked by the member for Werriwa - notwithstanding the fear that the member for Werriwa strikes in the heart of every Sydney taxi driver. The Leader of the Opposition is terrified of the trade union movement. He is terrified of losing the $5 million they provide every year; he is terrified of losing the support of their bloc vote, given his weak leadership; he is terrified of the secrets that they know about his time at the Storemen and Packers Union and which they can reveal. When it comes to a policy, and when it comes to taking a stand on any issue of principle - when it comes to anything except this parrot fashion repetition, `What do you know and when did you know it' - the Leader of the Opposition is simply paralysed by fear. If you are too scared to lead your own party you are too weak ever to lead the country.</DOC>

 - As I have previously said, the implication behind this question, of course, is that Senator Heffernan -  - As I said in beginning my answer, the implication, of course, behind this question is somehow that Senator Heffernan was authorised or encouraged or permitted or approved to make the statement, which of course is completely false. In relation to the record which Senator Heffernan sent to New South Wales Police Commissioner Peter Ryan, I have said today, on numbers of occasions, it is false. Senator Heffernan accepts that it is false. - As I have said on numbers of occasions, the senator himself accepts that they are false and I have said on numbers of occasions in here that they are false. The question was whether or not they were bogus. All right, you want to know whether they were bogus? I have said they were false. Senator Heffernan, as a consequence, is going to apologise. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his keen and abiding interest in ensuring that Australia maintains its clean and green image which is so important to the primary industries of his electorate and, indeed, to the whole of Australia.The reality is that Australia takes very seriously our desire to protect ourselves from pests and diseases which make such an impact on other parts of the world. The simple action of a traveller coming to this country with a product that carries a pest or disease could in fact result in the loss of billions of dollars to Australian industry and indeed to our economy. So the government, in fulfilment of its election commitments, is acting to increase penalties associated with quarantine offences and is upgrading our border protection arrangements to ensure that anyone attempting to break our laws is likely to be detected.A couple of weeks ago, the penalties for those who are intercepted at airports - the on-the-spot fines -  were doubled. Now it will cost $220 if somebody is detected at the airports bringing in something that they have failed to declare. Two hundred and twenty dollars is a high price to pay for an apple or a wooden souvenir or some other product that has been brought in from overseas. We have also introduced into the House legislation to establish a new offence in relation to deliberate smuggling of items of quarantine interest into Australia. The maximum penalty for this new offence will be $1.1 million and up to 10 years in jail. It is a clear demonstration that we are taking these issues very seriously.To help ensure that those new laws can be effectively implemented, the government is implementing a new $600 million strategy to upgrade our border protection services. I can report to the House that we are making excellent progress in implementing that strategy. When completed, our border protection service will be almost doubled. We will be inspecting 100 per cent of mail coming into this country, 100 per cent of cargo and at least 80 per cent of all passengers' luggage on arrival. A week or so ago I was in Brisbane, where the first of our international airports in capital cities has reached the target of 100 per cent inspection of all arriving luggage. Every passenger arriving in Brisbane, even if they have nothing to declare, will have their luggage either opened or X-rayed through some of the new equipment that has been provided by this government.We have also worked very hard to upgrade the inspections at our mail services. When Labor were last in government, less than two per cent of the international mail coming into Australia was subject to quarantine inspection. In their last period in government they actually reduced, by about 10 per cent, the number of quarantine people working in the mail exchanges. We have turned that around, and inspection rates at international mail centres in some places have already reached 100 per cent. When we came to office there were only 10 AQIS staff in international mail centres; now there will be 150 full-time AQIS staff in the mail centres. So we, unlike Labor, take these matters very seriously indeed. We are determined to ensure that there are appropriate penalties and deterrents in place -  - and that there are appropriate systems in place to ensure that those who bring products into this country that defy our law will indeed be detected and then the penalties that apply will be appropriate to the seriousness of the crime.</DOC>

 - Let me start my response to this question by saying that I do not accept the assumption upon which the second part of the question was based. The member for Barton will no doubt recall that the statement that the Prime Minister made, to which he refers, was in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition. - I have made a number of statements -  - I do not accept that the Prime Minister extended the allegations, as has been asserted in the question. - He did nothing of the sort. He was responding to the question from the Leader of the Opposition and the answer was entirely relevant to the question. On the question of personal attacks on the judiciary under the guise of parliamentary privilege, the member for Barton, I assume - without being able to confirm - is quoting me accurately. That was 1996 - some time ago. On that assumption, it was not an absolute statement; it was a qualified one, in which there might be appropriate occasions -  - Can I make it plain, Mr Speaker, that when an attack is made on the judiciary it is not, as a general proposition, the role of the Attorney-General to respond. A lot will depend on the circumstances and the nature of the attack or the allegation. In the case of Justice Kirby, the allegation made by Senator Heffernan related to personal conduct, not conduct as a judge, and promptly and emphatically Justice Kirby responded. He did it off his own bat without requesting assistance from me or from anybody from the government. It is entirely appropriate when the issues relate to the personal conduct of a judicial officer that that person be the one to respond. The Leader of the Opposition was, I think, in Brisbane yesterday endeavouring to convert Senator Heffernan's allegations in relation to the personal conduct -  - of Justice Kirby into an attack on the High Court. Let me make it plain: it was not an attack on the High Court. The allegations, as I have said, related to Justice Kirby's conduct personally. Justice Kirby's conduct as a High Court judge was not in question. The standing and respect in which the High Court is held by the Australian community and the Australian government were not in question -  - and are maintained. I have every expectation that Justice Kirby will continue to maintain the respect he has in the community. He will continue to do the important work he does in the High Court. I have every expectation that - whether it is for the purpose of creating a fiction for an MPI -  the Leader of the Opposition will continue to accuse the government, wrongly, of attacking public institutions.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker -  - I thank the member for Barker for his question and also note the fact that he has one of Australia's most beautiful electorates - which is a little biased, I know. Certainly Kangaroo Island is the Garden of Eden and the Coorong, where we launched the policy for the International Year of Ecotourism, is also a very special holiday destination.After the events of September 11 and the collapse of Ansett on 14 September, the federal government committed around $65 million in additional funds to support the tourism industry through some challenging times. That included $24 million to the Australian Tourist Commission over five years and an additional $8 million to the See Australia domestic tourism promotion campaign. In stark contrast, we have seen reports today and over the weekend in the Adelaide Advertiser that stated that almost $40 million of funding for Australian major events, innovation and regional development were under threat. So, according to the Labor Party in South Australia - the new Labor government - the axe is hovering over tourism funding and over major events funding in South Australia - events which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, particularly to regional South Australia. South Australia will host almost one-quarter of the 120 Australia-wide initiatives for the International Year of Ecotourism this year. In addition, the ecotourism industry contributes around $225 million annually to South Australia's economy, including 1,800 full-time jobs. About 200 of South Australia's tour operators, most of whom are small businesses, are dedicated to ecotourism.The South Australian Treasurer, Kevin Foley, said that his government is `shifting money out of areas that are not our priorities'. It seems as though tourism is not a priority for the new South Australian Labor government. It is a priority for the Howard government; it is a priority for the Liberal-National Party coalition in government. Tourism employs about 36,000 full-time people in South Australia alone. They spend around $3 billion annually in South Australia, which benefits over 78,000 small businesses. I call on Kevin Foley and the Labor government in South Australia to look again at whether it will cut back tourism funding in South Australia. South Australia cannot afford to have a reduction in tourism funding. The electorate of Barker cannot afford to have a reduction in tourism funding. The Labor Party has again shown its colours: it is about doing the tourism industry and small businesses in the eye.</DOC>

 - As I said last week, Senator Heffernan raised his concerns concerning Justice Kirby with me some time ago. I am not able to say how long ago it was. It was not a matter of months; it was more like a matter of years ago. We had several conversations in which I advised him of the operation of section 72 of the Constitution in relation to the removal of a judge for proven misbehaviour. I commented to him that the proper way of dealing with allegations of the sort he was concerned with was to take them to the New South Wales Police. I advised him to do that if he thought he had a case, and I advised him that he should not make any allegations unless he had tangible, strong evidence to do so. That was some time ago, and the matter has not been raised with me in recent times at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. If I may say so, the question could not have come from a more appropriate member of this House, who did such an outstanding job in Zimbabwe as a Commonwealth election observer. Honourable members will know that the Prime Minister, as Commonwealth chairman in office, convened a meeting of his committee on Zimbabwe in London overnight. The committee this morning announced a unanimous decision which strongly supports Commonwealth democratic principles and charts a path for Zimbabwe's return to adherence to these principles.The Prime Minister, together with President Mbeki of South Africa and President Obasanjo of Nigeria, was mandated by the Coolum Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to take action on the Commonwealth Observers Group report on the Zimbabwe elections in the event that that report was adverse. As members would well know, the group's report was indeed adverse, finding that the presidential elections in Zimbabwe were not free and they were not fair. The committee has, in effect, agreed to the findings of the observer group. As a result, the three leaders at the meeting chaired by our Prime Minister decided unanimously to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for one year; to engage with Zimbabwe to promote reconciliation; to address current issues of desperate food shortages, economic recovery, the restoration of political stability, the rule of law and the conduct of future elections; and to mandate the Secretary-General to the Commonwealth to engage with Zimbabwe on electoral reform, as recommended by the observer's report.Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo have been specifically mandated to exercise their continuing good offices. The Prime Minister has announced a contribution of $2 million in food aid through the World Food Program for the suffering people of Zimbabwe. All I can say is that this is a very good outcome for the Commonwealth, it is a good outcome for the people of Zimbabwe, and it is a good outcome for Africa. It is a direct result of the principled and consistent leadership that Australia has exercised within the Commonwealth on this issue. I know that all members of this House will want to join me in congratulating the Prime Minister on the outstanding job that he has done in London. He has shown very real leadership on this issue; I think he has shown extraordinary leadership on this issue. I think the Prime Minister has done this country proud and he has done the people of Zimbabwe proud as well. Let me say finally that my department has today issued a revised travel advice for Zimbabwe, and that advice is that Australians should defer all holiday and normal business travel to Zimbabwe until further notice. This reflects our concerns about the security situation there following the election.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde, and I thank her for her interest in the economy, which many Australians are interested in because it affects their lives, their mortgages, their job opportunities and the future opportunities for their children. I may be wrong about this, but it may be that the Australian Labor Party will not see fit to ask any questions about the economy in question time again. I do not think they have shown any interest in the economy in the last 12 months, ever since Australia became the strongest growing economy in the industrialised world.The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index today showed that the leading index of economic activity, which is indicative of the pace of economic activity in six to nine months time, was 7.3 per cent in January - well above the long-term trend of 3.4 per cent. The media release which was put out announcing it was headed `Leading index on fire'. The Westpac general manager of economics commented that `the growth rate had been driven by the strong December quarter national accounts', and that `the large move in the growth rate of the leading index was a measure of profits and productivity'. It is a good thing to see that Australian companies are being profitable at a time when we are in a synchronised world downturn. Good profits for companies mean better job opportunities. We saw job opportunities coming through in January and February, with an increase in the number of jobs. Also, the productivity story of the Australian economy has been a very good one, as Australia's growth rate has kicked up and our productivity has begun to lead the world. It is one of the reasons why our economy has performed more strongly than any other industrialised economy in the course of 2001.Although these indexes do come and go - and they are only indexes and we cannot say that they are actual results - this is a very positive indication that Australia's economy looks as if it has quite a deal of strength behind it for the course of 2002. The Economist poll has Australia leading the forecast for all of the developed world in 2002 and in 2003. I can assure the people of Australia that the coalition government is interested in good economic management. The coalition government is interested in jobs for Australians. The coalition government is interested in low mortgage interest rates and in helping families. We would welcome any interest at all that the Labor Party could show in any of those issues by perhaps deigning to ask a question about them in one of the many question times that will be occurring this week.</DOC>

 - Like the Attorney-General, I am not aware of who provided that to Senator Heffernan. I would have thought that, since there is going to be an inquiry by the Australian Federal Police, it might be prudent to actually await the inquiry. - For a group of people who are allegedly worried about the abuse of parliamentary privilege, I notice that on three occasions now you have managed to use parliamentary privilege in the hope that the media will use the name of a particular Comcar driver. I notice that on three occasions now, as a deliberate tactic, the Labor Party has used privilege to name a Comcar driver. -  - In continuation -  - the name that the Leader of the Opposition has just sought to raise under parliamentary privilege in the hope that that will get that name into the media, I consider -  - They are taking great delight in their success at getting it into the media. I would have thought that one of the lessons that may have been learned on both sides of the parliament over the course of the last couple of days is that it is proper to wait for an investigation to be conducted so that people's rights are respected, whether they be the rights of a High Court judge or whether they be the rights of a Comcar driver. The proper thing might be to actually await the investigation and, as for me and my part, I will await that investigation rather than play the games of the Australian Labor Party which is prepared to use parliamentary privilege to try and blacken people's names when they deserve a proper investigation.</DOC>

 - While the opposition peddles its weird conspiracy theories and blackens the name of Comcar drivers in its cheap attempt to make a political point, this government has been getting on with the job of delivering freedom, fairness and prosperity to the workers of Australia. I am very pleased to say that 950,000 new jobs have been created under this government's policy since March 1996. There are more jobs and there is higher pay; there are lower taxes and there are fewer strikes thanks to the policies of this government. We can deliver these good results to the Australian people because no-one owns us. We are not constrained by outside organisations to be a government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. All this `What did you know?' and `When did you know it?' routine, which the Leader of the Opposition practises, is just a smokescreen for the civil war that is now raging inside the Australian Labor Party between the reformers who want it to be a real democracy and the reactionaries who want the Labor Party to be nothing but the political wing of the ACTU. Yesterday in caucus, the member for Throsby said - and I am quoting from the Sydney Morning Herald - that she got the feeling from some in the party room that `anyone coming here with a union background was viewed as a liability to the Labor Party'. Let me put the member for Throsby to rights. It is not anyone; it is someone - if you live in Manly and head office foists you on the people of the Illawarra, then you are a liability. If you want to retire and you demand a safe seat in parliament as a reward for services rendered to the ACTU, then you are a liability. What those caucus members who are criticising the member for Throsby are really doing is talking in code for criticising the Leader of the Opposition because, let us face it, the Leader of the Opposition is the ultimate trade union hack. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition said to the secret Labor meeting at the Campbelltown Catholic Club:Labor's factional system was rewarding mediocrity and promoting candidates with few life skills ... - I am simply quoting the Leader of the Opposition who told the secret cabal at the Cambelltown Catholic Club:Labor's factional system was rewarding mediocrity and promoting candidates with few life skills and little understanding of the community they represent.Certainly the Leader of the Opposition ought to know because every position he has ever held has been delivered to him as a result of some factional deal. He was genetically programmed from birth to be a future leader of the Labor Party. He has never, ever lived in the electorate he purports to represent. - Just yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition came out of the faction civil war and said that it is time for the Labor Party to reach out to other groups in the community, such as small business. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to prove that he is serious, put up or shut up, and pass the government's fair dismissal legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. It gives me an opportunity to draw to the attention of members generally the situation at the moment in relation to people who have been found not to have protection obligations and who may be in situations such as the member described and contemplating their future. The fact is that at the moment we are hearing quite frequently from some advocacy groups - and, I might say, critics of the government's approach to unlawful arrivals - that it is not appropriate at this time to be returning anyone to Afghanistan.The fact is that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is very much involved in the return of people to Afghanistan at this time. That has occurred in the context of the many developments that have occurred, changing the political and general environment in terms of safety for Afghans. The reports from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees indicate that some 3,000 to 6,000 people are returning voluntarily from Iran and Pakistan each day and, since the beginning of this year, more than 180,000 people have returned spontaneously or under programs that the UNHCR itself has implemented.If honourable members take the opportunity to look at the web site of the UNHCR, they will find regular updates in relation to the return of Afghans at this time. The latest briefing note of 19 March estimates that more than 60,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan under UNHCR programs since the beginning of March. In addition, the International Organisation for Migration is actively involved in a return program, particularly for people with professional skills who might assist in the redevelopment of infrastructure, education, health, jurisprudence and communications, amongst other matters. Some Australians who have been settled here under earlier refugee programs have indicated a willingness to return. I saw on the registration list that is on the IOM web site that, amongst countries other than Iran, Pakistan or Tajikistan, which are the neighbouring countries, the United States has 214 people registered and Australia 75. Those two countries are amongst those with the greater numbers of professionals who are seeking to engage under this program.It is a very important package and it reflects, I think, that it is timely for the initiative that the Prime Minister foreshadowed of Australia providing reintegration assistance for people who have been found not to be refugees and to assist them in making an early decision to return and to start rebuilding their lives. There is no doubt that conditions in Afghanistan are difficult - there is no doubt about that at all - but I do not imagine that at this time they would appear any more difficult than they did to East Timorese, Kosovars or the people of Rwanda, all of whom returned home under programs of this sort. It is programs of this sort that are going to lead to the successful resolution of the refugee-like circumstances that many people face in different parts of the world.I want to confirm to the House that, at the conference recently in Bali, some of the discussions in which my ministerial colleagues and I were involved included meetings with representatives of the interim government of Afghanistan, where returns were discussed. Certainly, under the arrangements which we envisage there is a good deal of support from the interim administration for that to be facilitated. </DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition might lie awake in bed at night fantasising about what Senator Heffernan did and who he did it with, but let me say that question has been answered.  - But in case the Leader of the Opposition is under any doubt, let me say, in respect of the Comcar document that he has held up in this parliament, no-one in the government had seen that document, no-one in the department of finance had seen that document, and no-one was in a position to say that it was false, because no-one in the government had seen that document until it was published in the newspaper last Sunday. No-one in the government, apart from Senator Heffernan, had seen that document. Let me say this: the only people in this country who are still utterly obsessed with conspiracies are the extreme Left, the lunar of the right, and this man masquerading as the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and I congratulate him on his continuing contribution to the nation's environmental policies. The five-yearly Australia state of the environment 2001 report was released yesterday. This report is an independent assessment designed to help the government set its environmental priorities in the years ahead. It contrasts in a quite dramatic way with the findings of the previous five-yearly report, the 1996 state of the environment report, which recorded 13 years of environmental degradation and a story of monumental inaction by the Labor Party. The 1996 report described as `alarming' the destruction of wildlife habitats and the continuing threats to biodiversity; it identified salinity as a crucial problem which was not being addressed; it identified the damage to urban air quality from the absence of adequate fuel standards; it expressed concern over the management of our fisheries and the lack of action in relation to greenhouse gas emissions.Now the record that we see in the 2001 report is a dramatic contrast to the report of five years ago. The report I released yesterday says that our urban air is now cleaner because we have fuel emission standards put in place which are challenging and deal with the issue of noxious gases; our houses are more energy efficient; there is increasing use of renewable energy sources; efforts to economise on domestic water usage are succeeding; industries are developing codes of practice on environmental management; our biodiversity is better protected; we are better able to assess the health of our rivers; vegetative cover in much of Australia has improved as a result of the CSIRO's very successful efforts against the rabbit population; we are managing our marine resources better; and the ozone loss over the Antarctic appears to have stabilised.This does not mean that we still do not have very substantial environmental issues to address. The degradation of our river and land quality in the Murray Darling Basin is a matter that the government has put at the top of its priority list. With regard to the persistent threats to biodiversity, we now have in place instruments under the government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which can now address these issues. The government is addressing the pressure on our coral reefs and our coastal waters through its oceans and coastal policy. We now are putting billions of dollars through the National Action Plan, the Natural Heritage Trust, into addressing those environmental issues which in 13 years the Labor Party failed completely to address.The shadow minister for the environment could make a great contribution to Australia's environment if he would stop issuing these ill-considered and foolish press releases which fail to acknowledge the great progress that has been made and by selective quotation highlights the problems that this government, and not the Labor Party, has decided to address. </DOC>

 - The germane point here is that no-one, apart from Senator Heffernan, in the government or in the department of finance had seen the document which is in question here. You held up a copy of it in this place. They were therefore not in a position to know anything about the authenticity of that documentation. As to any other matters beyond that, the reality is that - as has been alluded to here several times today - they are the subject of investigation by the police and that is where the matter can satisfactorily lie. As has also been commented on here, you are attempting to construct a giant conspiracy case that does not stand up and I think it is well and truly time that you return to matters of substance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night in the Main Committee we saw the first attempt by the opposition to address any issue whatsoever in this term of the parliament to do with employment or employment services. There was no new policy; there was not even a hint of where to go to. In fact, there were not even any new ideas enunciated by the shadow minister. But he did have this to say:All we hear from Brough and Abbott are claims that the Job Network is performing better than previous labour market programs and is delivering results more cheaply. Claims of cheaper and better are one thing ...Those on this side of the House actually think that delivering targeted employment services cost effectively is what government should be about and we are quite proud of our achievements.I would like to reiterate what my senior minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, said earlier: there have been 950,600 new jobs created in the term of the Howard government over the last six years. Of those, 42 per cent - 395,400 -  have been full-time jobs. That compares to the abysmal results of those opposite in the last six years of the Labor government, when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister. In that time, there were 435,000 jobs created and only 12 per cent, or 54,000, of those were full-time jobs. The other 88 per cent were part-time and casual positions.Let me say something about the respective track records of employment services. What taxpayers got under Labor from 1990 was a doubling of expenditure on employment services and then, under the Leader of the Opposition's stewardship, a quadrupling of the money that they had spent since 1990 -  and yet for virtually no outcomes whatsoever. Today, we have targeted programs that are meeting the needs of the unemployed at about half the cost of those in Labor's last 12 months. The Leader of the Opposition had an answer, because in the dying days of the Labor government it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald:The federal government admitted last night that, `About half the dramatic fall in long-term unemployment in the past year has been the result of reclassifying people after they have been through job programs, even though they are still out of work,' a spokesman for Mr Crean said last night.So he was not satisfied with wasting taxpayers' money to the tune of $3,000 million and only achieving fewer than 10,000 full-time jobs annually over the last six years, he then had to delude himself and deliberately manipulate the unemployment figures to save his own political skin. There has been a lot of commentary in the last few weeks about part-time employment. The reality is that in 1993 the member for Kingsford-Smith introduced a bill into this place about unfair dismissal and, as a result of that bill and the impact it had on small business, it is no wonder the Labor Party could not create full-time jobs. Here we are 12 years later and they want a bit of deja vu. They want to revisit where they were and inflict upon the Australian work force and the job seekers of this country a system where we will have unfair dismissals inflicted upon these people again.The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in a press release of 14 March that a `12 month unfair dismissal exemption for casuals is essential for jobs'. The CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Mike Potter, said, `There is evidence small business is employing more casuals because of fear about unfair dismissals.' Then there is an unlikely ally to support the member for Hunter. We know what the member for Hunter and his wife think about unfair dismissal; she is a small businesswoman who has to deal with this challenge. I have a document here entitled, If not now,when? and it is a submission by one Lindsay Tanner, federal member for Melbourne, to the Hawke-Wran review of the ALP's structure and organisation. Maybe a few of those opposite would like a copy, because I do not think it is on his web site any more; it seems to have come down. Even in this document, he recognises the importance of this issue when he says:We should not allow important issues like unfair dismissal laws to become hostage to perceived need for Labor to distance itself from its union base.You do not need to distance yourself from the union base; they are distancing themselves from you at a rapid rate. In the Courier Mail on Tuesday, Doug Cameron said that working people were looking for a party that would boldly and unashamedly speak for them, `I think there is a view amongst union activists that the Labor Party is not that party.' He is right: the ALP is not that party. They are not interested in looking after the unemployed of this country and they are not after new opportunities; they are after saving their own political skin. It is time you supported the government's fair dismissal bill and supported the unemployed of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson, and I would like to welcome him back to parliament. The people of Paterson have the right Bob in parliament now. Bob Baldwin is no printer; he is a deliverer. Most importantly, he is a member of parliament with small business experience, and that is very important in the Hunter region, where we have seen massive growth in small businesses over the last few years.In particular, small business now contributes about 30 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product - about $200 billion a year. As the ABS report suggests, there are 1.2 million small businesses now in Australia, and half of those businesses - over 600,000 - started business whilst the coalition government has been in office. Most significantly, 34 per cent of all Australia's small businesses are located in regional Australia. I know that is very important to the Acting Prime Minister, because small business is in many ways the engine room of the regional Australian economy, representing over 400,000 businesses right across Australia. The member for Paterson asked me about threats to the viability of small business and employment opportunities in small business. I would have to say to the member for Paterson and other members of the House that the most significant threat to employment opportunities and small business is the Labor Party. I say that because, as we have heard from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations today, the Labor Party is intransigent in its opposition to our fair dismissal laws. We are trying to reform the unfair dismissal legislation, which is the ratbag legacy of the Labor Party. We are trying to reform it to create jobs in small business - and small business jobs in Paterson - but the Labor Party opposes it. In fact, if you judge the Labor Party on their form, and look at what they are doing in substance, have a look at what they are doing in Western Australia. I have talked on a number of occasions in this place about the sort of legislation drafted by the unions, for the unions, passed by the Labor Party in Western Australia. If we want yet another example of what this legislation does, there is a provision in the Western Australian Labor Party legislation that a small business can be forced to reinstate a sacked worker whilst the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission is looking into the allegation of unfair dismissal. So a small business can remove someone from the workplace, and they can claim unfair dismissal. The Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission, under Labor Party policy, is going to be able to order the business to have them back whilst the Industrial Commission deliberates. That is absurd for a small business of one, two or three employees - micro businesses - but it is a classic example of the attitude of the Labor Party in relation to employment law. If you want a summary, Leigh Hubbard, the secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, said on 3AK this week:I think people have started to say, `Well, what do they, the Labor Party stand for?'It would have been a better question had he asked what the Labor Party did not stand for. As the member for Paterson and other members in this House know, the Labor Party does not stand for low interest rates, it does not stand for low inflation, it does not stand for jobs and it does not stand for small business. </DOC>

 - The member for Barton is flogging a dead horse -  -  - Some eight years ago, while in opposition, I prepared a paper setting out my views on the role of the Attorney-General in defending the judiciary from criticism in public debate or in the media. That was in opposition. Since coming to office as Attorney-General in 1996, I have adhered to that view. I have adhered to it without variation and I have espoused it on a number of occasions since. Since I formulated those views in 1994, I have sought to win over the judiciary -  - and I substantially have. There have been a number of suggestions that it is the traditional role of the Attorney-General to defend the judiciary; it simply is not. The judiciary is able to defend itself in most situations and should do so. When you are concerned with personal attacks on a member of the judiciary, an allegation relating to personal conduct, it is not a matter for the Attorney-General to step in, not knowing the facts. The views that I formulated are not without support. In the Courier Mail last Saturday, there is an editorial which refers to the views that I formulated in 1994. In it, the Courier Mail says that:... while the lawyers who sprang to Justice Kirby's defence are annoyed at the Attorney-General's refusal to support the judge, it must be said that Mr Williams has held and expressed a consistent view on this issue of the role of the attorney for many years.The editorial goes on to say:... as, eight years ago, when Mr Williams was the shadow Attorney-General, he told the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration that there was a real risk of a conflict between the interests of the judiciary and making a substantive reply on an issue and the political interests of the Attorney-General, the government or the party in government in relation to the issue. He said it was more compatible with the independence of the judiciary from the executive government and more compatible with being so seen, that the judiciary not rely on the Attorney-General to represent or defend it in public debate. That view is given support in that editorial. I think the editorial is right. I think the member for Barton is wrong - thoroughly wrong. I think that the Hon. Gordon Samuels has got it wrong, too.</DOC>

 - As many members would be aware, Australia is on the threshold of one of the major demographic shifts in our history, in which the baby boomer generation begins to move into retirement and, over the next two decades, will become the older aged generation of Australia. In fact, if one looks at the demographic projections for the Australian population, you can see that the number of people over the age of 65 - which is currently about 2½ million Australians - is projected to increase by almost double that, to well over four million by 2021. This will have a major impact on all facets of life in this country.To take one example in relation to the work force, currently there are approximately 170,000 new entrants to the work force each year. For the entire decade from 2020 to 2030 it is projected that there will be only 125,000 new entrants to the work force - that is, for the entire decade of the 2020s there will be fewer new entrants to the Australian work force than there is every year at the present time. That, of course, will involve a massive reorientation of employment and will require employers - and, in particular, the human resource managers of major companies - to address these demographic changes.Of course, demographic changes involve not only challenges but also opportunities for Australia. For example, a recent Access Economics report projected that if the number of people in the work force aged between 55 and 70 could be increased by 10 per cent, or if we could retain an additional 10 per cent of people in the work force between the ages of 55 and 70, then that would largely ameliorate the impact of the reduction in new entrants to the work force. We know, in addition to that, that having a focus in life in older age is important for the health and wellbeing of individuals. Therefore, part of our strategy is to encourage all Australians to consider `ageing' - both in the national sense and, in particular, for themselves individually - much earlier. It is a fact that if people reach the age of 55, for example, in good or better health then there are better prospects for their health in older age. This is in the context of having just a few weeks ago released the government's framework document on a National Strategy for an Ageing Australia. In the coming weeks and months I will be engaged in a series of consultations right around Australia, beginning at the end of this week in the electorate of Murray, bordering onto the electorate of Farrer - where the honourable member is from - in Echuca and Moama, where the first of these consultations will take place; in the following week, in Colac in the member for Corangamite's electorate; and then in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.It is important that we engage the Australian population in relation to these issues - and engage not only the general population but also professional, business, academic and other groups, many of whom have already started to take a keen interest in looking at the precise policies and programs that we need to put into place in order to address these issues. So the strategy looks at a range of issues including retirement incomes, the changing nature of the work force, lifestyles and community support, health ageing and, of course, aged care. This work is being done in conjunction with other work being undertaken, for example, by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in relation to the mature age employment strategy and by my colleague the Attorney-General in relation to age discrimination legislation.I was asked by the honourable member for Farrer whether there were any alternative policies. The simple answer is that there are none from the opposition. In the election campaign last year there was no mention of a national strategy for an ageing Australia. This is something about which the opposition have absolutely no vision whatsoever. In fact, they are so disconnected from the Australian people that even the Leader of the Opposition recognises that, because in a letter that he recently wrote to people in Adelaide he begins by saying, `An important part of rebuilding the Labor Party for the next election is reconnecting with key members of local communities.' Here we have even the Leader of the Opposition admitting that they are totally out of touch with the Australian people - but, of course, his reconnecting with local communities consists of one consultation of an hour and a half in Adelaide. You need to do better than that.</DOC>

 - I cannot confirm that because, as has already been said in this House, Dr Boxall was not given a copy of the document which Senator Heffernan gave to Commissioner Peter Ryan. Since he had never seen the document, how could he possibly know it was false or bogus? As has already been said by my colleague the Minister for Employment Services, not only had Dr Boxall not been given a copy of that document; no other minister had been given a copy of that document. Senator Heffernan has made it entirely clear that he relied on that document, which he now concedes to be false, and he forwarded it to the New South Wales Commissioner of Police. He did not forward it to Dr Boxall or to the minister for finance or to the Prime Minister or to me. - Mr Speaker, the answer is absolutely on point: Dr Boxall was not given a copy of that document. How could he know it was false when he had not seen it, he had not been given it? How could any minister be in that situation? I think there are now 14 questions left until the end of question time this week. I will make a prediction. In all of those 14 questions there won't be one on interest rates; there won't be one on jobs, there won't be one on families. They will be sitting there thinking to themselves, `How do we eke out another 14 questions on who knew what and when and what they said to the sister and what the sister said to the mother and what they said over the back fence and what Uncle Tom Cobbley knew about it?'The facts are that no matter how often it is alleged, as has been said by Minister for Employment Services and as I have said, that document was not given to Dr Boxall, it was not given to the minister for finance, it was not given to the Prime Minister. It was given by Senator Heffernan to one person - the New South Wales Commissioner of Police, Commissioner Ryan. When Senator Heffernan became aware that it was not accurate, he had the decency to go and apologise. The judge had the graciousness to accept the apology. And the only people that want to keep this going are the Labor Party for their own tawdry ends. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I know that she is vitally interested in the supply of competitive energy to industries in her electorate and, in fact, to all Australians. Last Friday at the Ministerial Council on Energy, all states - which are all Labor states - and territories agreed with the Commonwealth to put in place an independent review of energy market directions. This review is crucially important not only in terms of the direction of policy but also to ensure that industry in Australia continues to have ready access to competitively priced energy. It is one of our most competitive points not only in terms of attracting foreign investment but also in creating jobs here in Australia by the expansion of industry. That review will provide guidance on energy market directions and priorities and is headed up by the Hon. Warwick Parer, who all members will know has a very sound background in government and management experience in the resource and energy companies. -  - You have to have members of parliament with real life experience. I know that is not the view on that side of the House, but it is on this side of the House. Mr Speaker, if I can go on, the panel members also include David Agostini, Paul Breslin and Rod Sims. The panel members, along with the chairman, bring a wide-ranging and practical experience from the energy sector to this review. We saw on Friday, earlier in the day, a very interesting discussion between the states. In fact, if it got any more interesting during the national electricity market discussions you would have been able to sell tickets to it. The Leader of the Opposition's brother did a sterling job supporting the Victorian minister, Candy Broad. Both of them were working against two other states, New South Wales and Queensland. Minister Broad and Minister Crean were keen to see real competition in the electricity market. So we have that as a backdrop in the morning. In the afternoon, there was the release of an issues paper by the chairman of the review committee. The panel will now travel all around Australia discussing the matter and make a short visit overseas to gain some international experience.   -  - It excites them so much, Mr Speaker. I am sure members of both sides of the House will look forward to the interim reports, as we ensure that Australia's energy requirements remain competitive.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. The government has been very proactive in the development of fuel quality standards and we have set new petrol and diesel standards, which took effect on 1 January this year, which are contributing to both cleaner air in our cities and to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The new standards promote the adoption of modern vehicle technology and improved emission outcomes. The member for Kennedy may also be aware that during the election campaign the government committed itself to a $50 million plan, Biofuels for Cleaner Transport, and that program will promote the production, distribution and transport of biofuels, including ethanol. So we are very interested in the production of ethanol and its role in cleaner fuels and cleaner transport. The government is interested also in the point that the member for Kennedy raised about a statutory regulation. He perhaps implied that what the government was looking at was some mandatory inclusion of ethanol. That is not the case. What the government is, however, looking at is an appropriate ethanol cap for petrol so that we can make sure that ethanol is used up to an appropriate level but not beyond that level. The government has put out a discussion paper on that matter. We have not expressed a final view in that discussion paper on what that cap should be, but we are very willing to listen to any contributions from industry that will help the government make a sensible and wise decision on that point. So the government is certainly willing to put in place programs that will assist those who are interested in ethanol production. We see a significant role for ethanol in the future and, if there is any assistance that we can give within the government's programs to help industries move into the production of ethanol, we will be very pleased to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The issue of our trade with Indonesia is critically important to her constituents and, indeed, constituents right across regional Australia. This goes also to the previous questioner from the electorate of Kennedy, where the live cattle exports from that part of Australia are extremely significant. In 1996 - which happened to be the year that our government was elected to office - our two-way trade with Indonesia stood at $3.7 billion. In the time since then, until the last financial year, we have seen that increase dramatically to $8.4 billion. Trade has increased from $3.7 billion to $8.4 billion. So, in the last three years, Australian exports to Indonesia have grown by a staggering 50 per cent. This is a clear indication that our government's policies and our energies are being focused on getting on with business with the rest of the world but, more importantly, within our region. It is getting on with business but it is also getting on with Indonesia. We have been lectured by the Labor Party and their fellow travellers for many years about the fact that it is only the Labor Party that can get on with Indonesia, that it is only the Labor Party that can have a decent relationship with Indonesia. These statistics prove the fallacy of that. Since the crisis we have grown the level of business we are doing with Indonesia, and it has grown quite considerably. The latest instalment in this very good story is that recently I met with my counterpart, Minister Soewandi, in Indonesia. Following representations by the Prime Minister and me, we convinced the Indonesians that they should not impose a dumping tariff on wheat flour - wheat that would have come from the member for Riverina's electorate. It was going to range between five and 30-odd per cent. We negotiated that with the Indonesians and that is saving an impact of $28 million worth of trade. Comparing that with when the Labor Party was last in office and when the Leader of the Opposition was the primary industries minister, between 1991 and 1993, the record shows that not one question was asked of the Leader of the Opposition - the then Minister for Primary Industries - about agricultural trade with Indonesia. Between 1995 and 1996, when the member for Fraser was the Minister for Trade, not one question was asked by the Labor Party of the then Minister for Trade on agricultural trade with Indonesia.My final point on this issue is that our farmers all know that they were sold out by the Australian Labor Party in the negotiations in the Uruguay Round. They were not represented properly in terms of the international trade negotiations that took place. At least our government is taking action in terms of representing our primary producers in Australia. Our government and our backbenchers are interested in asking questions of substance of government ministers about what is happening with the Australian economy and what we are doing in our engagement with the world and our engagement with the region. The Australian Labor Party in this place is not interested in asking questions of substance about how the economy is going and how we are representing their interests internationally.</DOC>

 - The short answer to that is that I am not the police commissioner and I cannot directly answer the question. I do not imagine that anybody would reasonably expect me to. We have worked through this in considerable detail. You talk about a false and scandalous ending to this session; the reality is that when the allegations were established to have been false certain actions followed, in case you had not noticed. Senator Heffernan lost his position. He apologised unreservedly. That apology was accepted in a very substantial way. That gives closure to this matter. The attempted repeated exercises by the opposition to mount the case that there has somehow been an enormous conspiracy smacks very clearly of a desire to make political hay - not to uphold and enhance the institutions of the nation, as they would have you believe. Furthermore, it has to be said that the Leader of the Opposition, backed by the member for Barton, behaved disgracefully yesterday when, under privilege, he named a former Comcar driver in relation to the documents given to Senator Heffernan. Senator Cook named him in the other place. The bottom line is that the Labor frontbenchers did not just make allegations; they accused, tried and found guilty an individual probably subject to investigation, appropriately, outside this place. They did so in a way that I think smacks very much of their having one rule for people in high positions and another for working men and women.It is very interesting to note that one of their own, Senator Cooney, made the observation this morning, `We have got to be very careful in naming him.' He went on to say:We ought to only do so after there is sufficient satisfaction that is appropriate to naming. In other words, if we - this is a Labor senator - object to the naming of the judges under particular circumstances, then, you know, we have got to [exercise] concern in naming others.He had it right, and your hypocrisy is exposed. You are engaged in an exercise in political opportunism, and it is about time you returned to some matters of substance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I draw the attention of the House to the simple fact that she is the only member of the House who has asked questions on Zimbabwe in recent times, which demonstrates that this is an issue on which one can at least talk to this side of the House, because we have an interest in those issues, not in muckraking.The international community's reaction to the decision of our Prime Minister and the presidents of South Africa and Nigeria to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth has been overwhelmingly positive. The House, and particularly the honourable member for Curtin, will be interested to know that the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, Morgan Tsvangirai, said that the outcome was `very appropriate' and `very important' as it sends a consistent message about the values of the Commonwealth. The British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, expressed his deepest appreciation to the Prime Minister, President Mbeki and President Obasanjo on what he described as a `most important and very significant outcome'. I am glad to say that New Zealand - in the form of Phil Goff, the foreign minister - has made similar and very positive comments.What the Prime Minister has achieved, with the two presidents, is a simply extraordinary thing. It illustrates the point that in diplomacy your initiatives and your actions need to be carefully calibrated and carefully timed. For example, I notice that prior to the election in Zimbabwe, at a time when we were deploying observers as part of the Commonwealth observers team, Australia's Leader of the Opposition was calling for Australia to impose `smart' sanctions. We made it clear that that would not be appropriate for as long as the observers could do their job. If we had followed the advice of the opposition at that time, we would not have been able to send observers to Zimbabwe at all as part of the Commonwealth team. If all Commonwealth countries had done that, there would have been no Commonwealth observers and the Commonwealth would never, in the end, have been able to agree to take the action that it took.I notice that the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was still calling for sanctions. What the government has said about that is the same as we have always said - timing and context are everything. We keep alive the option of imposing sanctions if we think it is appropriate. I remind the House that Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe, the man who has been so terribly wronged by the false election that took place in that country, said last night when asked about sanctions: I think they should wait until the so-called negotiations take place - that is, which are being promoted by the Commonwealth. He continued:I think you cannot have it both ways. I think this should act as an incentive for good behaviour on the part of Mugabe.The leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe is right. This is an option that should be kept alive. But this is not the time to take that step.Our government deplores the laying of formal charges of treason against Mr Tsvangirai. The harassment of the opposition in Zimbabwe must stop. We on this side of the House, the Australian government, are deeply sceptical of the basis for this charge - the SBS's Dateline program. I have discussed this program and this evidence with a number of foreign ministers in governments which I would believe to have the capacity to assess this material, and all agree that it is extremely unconvincing coverage. I do not think I have met a foreign minister, apart from perhaps Mr Mudenge, the Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe, who thinks that those accusations have any credibility whatsoever.Finally, I apologise that I forgot to mention, in the context of the reactions of the international community, what happened in Canada. Honourable members might be interested to hear this. When the Canadian Prime Minister stood up in the Canadian House of Commons and announced that the troika, including our Prime Minister, had suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, the Canadian parliament - the government and the opposition - rose as one and gave our Prime Minister and the two presidents a standing ovation. The Canadian Prime Minister was not part of the troika. In the Canadian parliament our Prime Minister and others were given a standing ovation. In this House of Representatives - the counterpart of the House of Commons in Canada - we yesterday had 10 questions from the opposition, abusing parliamentary privilege, which attempted to smear a Comcar driver and wilfully smear the reputation of decent people by accusing them of doing things that the opposition knows those people did not do. In this parliament we have the unedifying sight of a dishonest and dishonourable opposition and in Canada they gave our Prime Minister a standing ovation.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister quite appropriately remarked, he is not a policeman. He sought to ensure that matters that needed reviewing were properly reviewed and when the status of the particular document in question, and at the centre of this dispute, was established he took the action, which is now well recorded and which was appropriate. I do not believe that there is any need to add further to that situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note his very real interest in aviation matters. I regret to inform the House, for the benefit of those who have not heard the news, that air traffic controllers, under the direction of the air traffic controllers union, Civil Air, has coordinated strike action which will see air traffic controllers at Brisbane, Coolangatta and Sydney walk off the job between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. today. This is deeply regrettable and, I believe, totally unnecessary and unwarranted action on their behalf. This follows their action last week which significantly interrupted travel flows across the nation. Today's action will have the effect of disrupting up to 75 per cent of flights nationally. That will massively inconvenience the public. It will further create difficulties for an industry which, as we all know, is regrettably facing awkward circumstances at the moment. As it seeks to recover its ground and as industries that depend upon it, like tourism, seek to recover their ground, I have to say that I think this action is highly irresponsible. It comes about largely as a result of an unreasonable union demand that Airservices withdraw from today's scheduled hearing before the Industrial Relations Commission and that they agree to commence private mediation, presumably with a union friendly mediator.The union's demand is quite contemptible. It is an attempt to derail an established dispute resolution process under the Workplace Relations Act. I also think it represents a very unsatisfactory affront to Commissioner Deegan. Commissioner Deegan told them what they apparently did not want to hear last week which was that their demands were unreasonable, there was a satisfactory negotiating process which they could access and ought to participate in and they ought to go back to work. She urged them to do so in the strongest possible terms.I think it ought to be placed on record that Airservices, which enjoy my full support in this matter, have been prepared to compromise on a number of significant matters. For example, they are prepared to treat all unions involved as a single bargaining unit; they are prepared to agree to a three-year certified agreement, as opposed to a one-year agreement; to maintaining existing redundancy entitlements; the offer of a three per cent annual pay rise plus a further one per cent base pay productivity increase; and they have offered to pay a two per cent annual cash bonus provided that profit margins are met - a very substantial offer that many Australians at the moment could only dream about. On the other hand, they cannot give way to union demands such as a 17½ per cent base pay rise - again, I stress, at a time when many people in aviation would be thankful just to have their jobs.Last week I called on those opposite to join us in exercising some leadership on this matter and to state a position in relation to this matter. They feign great concern for the aviation industry, for the people who work in it, for the people in vital Australian industries like tourism but will not take a leadership position on this at all. Perhaps it would have been a triumph of hope over experience - hope that they might have taken a position - but all we saw was some regrettable remarks from the member for Batman, saying `Wasn't it terrific that the unionists were exercising their right to take part in industrial action.'It is worth noting that the Labor Party does pretty well out of some of these unions. Two of the five unions involved in this dispute, for example, contributed between them no less than $270,000 to the ALP during 2000-01. So perhaps we should not be surprised that we are not getting any exercise of leadership at all from the Leader of the Opposition in this matter. The ultimate irony is that the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite are so lacking in any policy position, in any leadership from the Leader of the Opposition, that their holding company and the shareholders in it are restless, they are walking away, they are not getting a return on their investment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I can inform the House that, because of the workplace partnership that this government has tried to encourage through its policy and through its legislation, strikes in Australia have fallen to consistently low levels. In fact, the latest statistics show that strikes in Australia are at the lowest levels on record. That is good news for everyone, because strikes definitely cost jobs. While members opposite peddle their conspiracy theories, while members opposite run around parroting mindlessly, `What did you know, and when did you know it,' this government is getting on with the job of building a better Australia.Unfortunately, there are still some pockets of ultra-militant unionism - union leaders who have not worked out yet that the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and that communism has since been utterly discredited. I can tell the House that in the last few weeks Sydney bus commuters have been forced to walk to work because the New South Wales Labor government still allows the union movement to substantially control public transport in that state. Perth building sites have been closed down regularly because the CFMEU is trying to intimidate the royal commission. I have to say that the Gallop government does not have the guts to use the legislative powers it has to stop this industrial action. Today and over the last fortnight tens of thousands of Australian air travellers have had their plans disrupted because of the campaign of strikes and stoppages by workers who are earning, on average, $75,000 a year. Let me say this: the public should not have to put up with capricious strikes fuelled by union bravado.If the Prime Minister and a Comcar driver are supposed to be in a conspiracy because they once shared a vehicle, what does that say about union militants and the members of parliament opposite that they preselect, fund, instruct and send to Canberra? The Leader of the Opposition has completely and utterly wasted the time of this parliament over the last fortnight. He will not make any constructive contribution to public debate in Australia. He would use the moral authority, such as it is, conferred upon him by his position as a former leader of the ACTU, and he would condemn today's strike. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to liberate his party from the dead hand of militant unionism by repudiating the notorious 60-40 rule.</DOC>

 - As has been repeated many times in relation to this debate that the opposition is so intent on pursuing in this place, the material that Senator Heffernan relied upon in making his allegations was given to the New South Wales police. When it was established to be false, certain very real actions and outcomes followed. That is the matter to which you might appropriately have referred your endeavours this week.  - In relation to other materials, I just do not regard them as germane to this debate. - They're not. They are subject to appropriate investigations and detailed questioning. If they are believed to be of some relevance, the opposition ought to pursue that with the relevant minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question about Commonwealth-state financial relations, because normally one would get a question about this from the opposition in the lead-up to a Premiers Conference. I fear that the opposition have six more questions on when did you know and what did you think about 1992 or, alternatively, 1996, so I am very pleased that the member for Page has asked about this very important issue of Commonwealth-state financial relations.Tomorrow all the state treasurers and chief ministers will be coming to Canberra to determine the payments of GST revenue to the states for the forthcoming year. I can inform the House that every last dollar of GST revenue will be received by the Labor government in New South Wales and the Labor government of Victoria and the Labor government of Queensland and the Labor government of South Australia - every single last dollar. But, of course, if it had been up to their federal Labor Party colleagues, there would be no such revenue. There would be no such revenue because the Labor Party opposed Australia's great and significant tax reforms. I think everyone on this side of the House will feel proud that we led and the Labor Party followed in relation to tax reform.In the year 2001-02, the payments of GST revenue to the states are estimated to be $26.8 billion. In the year 2002-03, they are estimated to be $29.3 billion. GST will pay for every schoolteacher in every classroom in every school in every state in the next year. GST will pay for every policeman on the beat in every state next year. I wait with bated breath to see if any of those state treasurers will be asking about the roll-back policy tomorrow. I wonder if roll-back is still the policy of the Labor Party? - Mr Speaker, I was just waiting for the interjection. - Remember for the last three years the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition used to come into question time - do you recall? - with his Hockey Bear pyjamas and his salads and complain about the GST which, if it was not going to throw Australia into recession, was going to put starving people out on the streets. We waited for three years for intense political attack and we waited and waited for the roll-back policy. Oh, he teased so much but he delivered so little. After three years we had waited for so much. The teasing had been so great that the disappointment was even greater.As we now front up to the sixth year of the Labor Party in opposition, full of questions on when did you know, who did you tell, what did your mother think, what did Uncle Tom Cobley say, what happened in 1992, what happened in 1994, you will not hear a question in this parliament about jobs for Australians. You will not hear a question in this parliament about interest rates for struggling families. You will not hear a question about Commonwealth-state financial relations. You will not hear a question about how we fund the schoolteachers in the classrooms in the schools of Australia. If you want some sensible leadership on these sorts of issues, you can go to the Labor Premier of Queensland. On 5 March 2002, Peter Beattie - a successful Labor leader compared with Labor leaders in this House - said: The growth funding returning to the state government as a result of the GST will be largely invested in the education of our children and young people.That investment would not have occurred if it had been for federal Labor. It only occurred because this side of the House had the decency to lead on matters of real policy, and we will continue to do it.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition continues to try to build his conspiracy case. There is a problem, though: it washes with no-one. No-one believes him.An opposition member - We do! - He does! There you go; he believes him. Can I just say it beggars description. Firstly, in terms of his question, he is absolutely wrong. Let me nail this once and again: Senator Heffernan was not `allowed'. He was not given authority; he was not encouraged - just the opposite. He was told not to make allegations he could not substantiate under parliamentary privilege. That is point one. -  - Put into some sort of context, understanding the personalities at play, understanding the relationships at work here and the commitment that members of the government display to one another, it beggars description that the ALP could actually believe that we would ask Senator Heffernan to go and do something if we believed that it was going to be based on a false assumption and would result in the outcomes it did. It is an absolute absurdity, and it highlights the shallowness and superficiality of the opposition's conspiracy claim.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question about education and in particular for his advocacy for the Blue Mountains International Hotel Management School, which takes a lot of students from overseas. Australia has changed enormously over the last half-century and also the last decade, and our country is changing very quickly. The agrarian land and labour-intensive industries that made Australia what it is are now competing alongside emerging industries in the services sector - in education, health, information and communication technology - which in many ways represent the future of the next generation, the basis of which is of course education.This government is committed to education for all Australians - for young Australians and for those who are not so young. Since 1995, the number of overseas university students coming to Australia has increased by 66,000. In fact, in the six years from 1994 to 2000 there was an 84 per cent increase in the number of overseas students undertaking education and training in Australia. Education is now Australia's fastest-growing export service sector. It is worth more than $4 billion a year, which in dollar terms makes it worth as much to Australia as wheat. It is worth more than sheep and it is worth more than beef. There are now more than 188,000 overseas students enrolled in Australian education and training. The Australian Financial Review said last Friday:Australia is still top of the list for its 130,000 international students at tertiary institutions when it comes to the affordability ... and living expenses.In fact, a recent study by Australian Education International and IDP Education, which is the marketing arm of Australian universities, found that the United States is 300 per cent more expensive for international students, the UK 66 per cent more expensive and Canada up to 30 per cent more expensive. This, of course, is excellent news for Australia and Australian education and training providers.I am asked about alternative policies, and there are alternative policies which could endanger this excellent result for Australia. It seems we have had some statements from the member for Jagajaga, but she appears not to be confident enough to put them on the Labor web site. The member for Jagajaga's web site still says `Under construction', and presumably, like the Leader of the Opposition, it is a 1,000-day work in progress with the CFMEU. The member for Jagajaga recently implied that all qualified students should be entitled to a place at university. I ask honourable members to think about that for a moment: all eligible students in Australia should get a place in higher education. In fact, it was reported of the honourable member in the Australian newspaper on 6 March that:She sees unmet demand - qualified students who do not get a place - as a 'shocking waste'.The question I ask is: is it Labor Party policy that all qualified students are entitled to a place in university? I have now been provided by my department with the latest estimate on unmet demand for university places this year. It is around 52,000 students.The opposition has focused a lot today, and in the last few days, on the year 1992. A lot of Australians remember 1992. In 1992 there were 100,000 students in this country who could not get a place in higher education when applications to universities were only marginally less than they are now. We should also reflect on this - and this might give us some insight into why the member for Jagajaga has not chosen a Treasury portfolio - if you take 52,000 students and you multiply that by about $12,000, which funds an equivalent full-time student unit place, you are looking at more than $600 million more to fund what we understand is now Labor Party policy. Now, $600 million dollars is more than the total operating grants given to Sydney and Melbourne universities combined.I will tell you what many Australians remember from 1992, apart from 100,000 students who could not get a place in university. I sat in a house in the northern suburbs of Hobart - a brick and tile three-bedroom house like many of the houses that Australians aspire to own - and it had been repossessed because the breadwinner of that house had lost his job. There were more than a million Australians without work, interest rates were just coming off a peak of 17.5 per cent to buy a house, and there were 100,000 Australian students who could not get a place in higher education. I say to the Australian Labor Party: you cannot have it both ways. You cannot go out there and say to Australians what they want to hear - you cannot cruelly raise the expectations of 52,000 people that the Labor Party say they will fund a place for in higher education at a cost in excess of at least $600 million - and then come in here every single day and defy everything that is done by this government to assist in the creation of wealth and the creation of employment. If you want to talk about 1992, I can tell you, we will be talking a lot about 1992 for the rest of the term of this government.</DOC>

 - I have nothing further to add to the substantial issues that have been addressed in this place. In terms of those matters that go to the understandable national interest and all of those sorts of things, I really think they have been adequately dealt with - I really do. I really think it is time to move on. I am sorry to say that I genuinely believe that the flimsiness of your case has been exposed, that it is a ridiculous construct that you are trying to mount. The suggestion that we would willingly send in somebody on evidence that we somehow or other knew was false is just so absurd, so ludicrous, so impossible that I do not think anybody would see it as having any credibility. Can I say that, since at last there seems to be some interest in asking me some questions, there are a number of matters out there that I would really like to be asked about. There are some issues that I think are important, that I would like to hear explored - rail reform, natural resource management, rural health, air services, regional air services. What about it?</DOC>

 - While the Leader of the Opposition is peddling his conspiracy theories, there are real issues out there that are worrying the Australian people, such as the outrageous strike which is disrupting the travel plans of tens of thousands of Australians. Let us just see how concerned the Leader of the Opposition is with the sorts of issues that really worry the Australian people. This completely obsessed and fantasy fixated Leader of the Opposition, when he came into the House today, was doorstopped. The question that he was asked was:JOURNALIST: Flight schedules around the country are being disrupted to day by an air traffic controller's strike ... Is that an industrial campaign that you support?That was the question he was asked. What did the former President of the ACTU say? You will be embarrassed, Mr Speaker, to know. The Leader of the Opposition said:CREAN: I'm not even aware of the issue I must say.Tens of thousands of Australians are disrupted, and he is not even aware of the issue. He went on to say:I'd have to take, I'd just have to get briefed on it.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said, because he is so obsessed with his fantasies and his conspiracy theories. He has more conspiracy theories than Pauline Hanson.Today's strike certainly has refocused attention on the political links of registered organisations. The trouble with unions today is that there are far too many union officials who are more interested in negotiating their preselections in the ALP than they are in negotiating a better deal for the workers of Australia. But there is hope and I want to congratulate some members opposite for trying to break the union faction stranglehold over the Australian Labor Party. It takes courage to confront an entrenched and corrupt establishment and in this respect the member for Fremantle, the member for Melbourne, the member for Barton, the member for Werriwa, the member for Hunter and the member for Griffith deserve the respect of this House in this matter at least.The Leader of the Opposition has ratted on the reformers. He went to the ACTU and said to them, `I'm no Tony Blair.' You can say that again! He certainly is not any Tony Blair. Then this week he said:I can never envisage a Labor Party without a relationship with the trade union movement ...The truth is the Leader of the Opposition has sold out. He is scared of Kevin Reynolds. He is scared of the man who believes that you should go onto a workplace with 40 thugs in tow. He is scared of the man who gave $668,000 to the Labor Party last year. He is scared of the man who controls the biggest single faction inside the Western Australian Labor Party. He is scared of Craig Johnson, the man who believes that the best way to enter a small business is to smash down the front door with a crowbar, who gave $437,000 to the Labor Party last year and who controls the largest single block vote inside the Victorian Labor Party even though he is actually a Trotskyite. The one person the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to be scared of at the moment is the member for Werriwa. The Leader of the Opposition is not scared of the member for Werriwa - unlike the taxi drivers of Sydney. The member for Werriwa might be a brute, but he is a brute with brains, guts and ideas -  unlike the Leader of the Opposition. That is something which the ABC faction inside the Labor Party, the `anyone but Crean' faction, is quickly coming to realise. The Leader of the Opposition has wasted two weeks of parliamentary time. If he had any guts, any decency at all, he would do the one thing that he can control - he would repudiate the militant unions who are now holding the air travellers of this country to ransom.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I understand it, the New Zealand scheme was a no-fault scheme, a nationalised scheme which essentially arranged to pay out without an inquiry as to liability. I am aware that over the years it has had enormous unfunded liabilities, as you would expect in a scheme of that nature. That scheme was put forward as a model in Australia, as I recall, by the Whitlam Labor government back in the early seventies and it was rejected. It was rejected because it would have involved nationalisation of the insurance industry, it would have involved no fault and it would have involved huge liabilities of the dimension that you have indicated. Over a period of about 25 years in Australia the New Zealand scheme has not held out much attraction for policy makers. I doubt it has even held out attraction for the Australian Labor Party, which did champion it back in the early seventies.With the meeting that is coming up in relation to public liability, the Commonwealth is convening a meeting of the states to talk about public liability which is beginning to affect voluntary organisations in the community. My view is that, at the end of the day, either the people who are insured have to pay higher premiums or the victims have to accept less generous compensation or, perhaps, higher hurdles in relation to liability. If you are to restrict the compensation or to put in place hurdles in respect of liability, that will require reform of the common law and that is uniquely within the province of state governments. That is a very important point. If you were to restrict compensation verdicts or to put hurdles in the way of liability, you would have to override the common law of tort, and that is a matter for state governments. Those issues cannot be addressed except by state governments legislating.So the Commonwealth has called a meeting and will be discussing with the states some of the proposals which they have put forward - different jurisdictions have put forward different proposals - to share claims experience and to see if the states can benefit from each other's experience and each other's proposals. I hope there will be a positive approach brought to this very great problem and that, through cooperation between the states, progress can be made. The Commonwealth will have a facilitative role in relation to those states and their proposals to address what I believe is a very real problem in the community. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I think everyone in this House recognises that he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of aviation and a very in-depth understanding of tourism. Some even refer to him as the father of tourism in the House. -  - And they are beautiful children that he has had! The Australian Bureau of Statistics today at 11.30 released some very important figures in relation to Australian inbound tourism over the last few months. Until today, since September, the inbound tourist numbers have been dramatically lower than they were a year ago. I am pleased to advise the House -  -  - This is a serious issue, Mr Speaker. - I am pleased to advise the House -  - For the first time since September, tourism numbers in Australia are up, and I think we all welcome that. In February of last year 438,700 people came to Australia. In February of this year it is 443,400, which is up one per cent. That is the first positive gain in tourist numbers we have seen since September. It is a direct result of the recovery of the global aviation market, and it is a result of the increased contribution of the federal government to the Australian Tourist Commission's strategic campaigns. For example, we launched a campaign at the beginning of this year into the American market. In September last year we obviously stopped marketing. We started again in January, and I am pleased to advise the House that the American arrivals are up two per cent on the same period last year. We have also launched a campaign into the United Kingdom and our numbers are up 6.1 per cent on last year. China is a massive increase, primarily because of the Chinese new year. The Chinese inbound market is up 84 per cent, which is a massive increase. It is of concern that New Zealand is down over 25 per cent. It reminds me of the fact that a week ago we launched a campaign in New Zealand, spending up to $1 million, promoting Australia as a tourist destination. It is a total waste of money spending that sort of sum in New Zealand if a New Zealand plane cannot get into Coolangatta because of an air traffic controllers' strike today. It is a complete waste of time and money. -  - And the opposition think it is funny. But if the opposition think it is funny, they should ask the tourism operators on the Gold Coast who have had to contend with the September effect and who have had to contend with the collapse of Ansett, but who have had some success with arrivals from New Zealand through Freedom Air over the last few months - and at a time when the Australian tourism industry still remains brittle. They do not need a blow to a bruise that has been provided by the air traffic controllers at a number of Australian airports. It would be easy for the Leader of the Opposition to pick up the phone to his union mates and say, `Hey, give the tourism industry a break here, fellas. Get back to work.' Why won't the Leader of the Opposition do that? Why?   -  - I will tell you. He is not aware that the issue is occurring. - The biggest impediment to tourism growth, the biggest impediment to tourism numbers, is uncertainty about the product supplied by the Australian tourist market. Having some of our major airports closed down by union officials and people who are blackmailing the Australian tourist market because of their industrial action is the biggest threat to the Australian tourist industry. I know why the Leader of the Opposition does not ring up his mates: it is because they supplied $270,000 last year to the Labor Party. They supplied over a quarter of a million dollars to fund the Labor Party. That is why the Leader of the Opposition will not ring them up. He is like a hair trigger on an empty water pistol: he has no effect.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin, who I know has got a very keen interest in youth issues. I had the pleasure of visiting some of her programs - the Reconnect service and the JPET program - in her electorate recently. There is a fundamental difference between this side of the House and that side of the House when it comes to youth policy and youth issues, and that is that on that side of the House they have been taken youth for granted for years and that is why young people have been deserting the Australian Labor Party in their voting pattern for the last 17 years and voting for this side of the House.One of the reasons why young people are voting for the coalition is that we believe it is important to listen to their voice. I would like to acknowledge 50 young Australians who have come to this parliament in the last few days for the National Youth Roundtable, and indeed of course the contribution that has made by those members of the House who are still here, because we believe that getting the views of young Australians is particularly important when it comes to government policy formation. One of the pieces of good news that came out for Australian young people this week was the government's Youth Allowance Evaluation - Final Report, which absolutely supports the reason why the coalition government introduced Youth Allowance back in 1998. The reason is that, in the old days of Austudy, it was much easier for young people to access the dole than it was for them to go on to further education and training. That was absolutely disgraceful, and that was the policy that the Labor Party had prior to 1996.Youth Allowance has meant that today more young Australians are involved in education and training than ever have been before. I notice the member for Goldstein nodding his head. He is a major architect of that success, I might add, and should be congratulated, because didn't we cop a rubbishing from the Australian Labor Party back then! It is interesting to note that in the last three years there have been very few references made to Youth Allowance by the Australian Labor Party. Why? Because, for every year since its introduction in 1998 for 16-to 17-year-olds, 10,000 new students have gone on to continue year 12. We have today 385,000 young Australians who are directly involved in training or education because of Youth Allowance.Further good news is the assistance that we have given - and I know the member for Gwydir, the Deputy Prime Minister, would verify this - in allowing rent assistance. They never had rent assistance before. In all the surveys that we have done, particularly for those in rural and remote communities, 75 per cent have said that if they could not have got rent assistance they could not have gone on to further studies. Isn't that a good outcome? Even two-thirds of those who were not in rural or isolated areas have stated that getting rent assistance has allowed them to continue education rather than go on the dole. I have got to say that in this complacency by Labor there is a breath of fresh air, because a brand new frontbencher has come clean. The secret is out that the Australian Labor Party is failing our youth. I would like to quote the member for Gellibrand - she is a good shadow minister out there trying her hardest - in the Australian, where she said Labor does not work well for some; it is actively discouraging for others. She goes on to say: ... young people do not join or stay with us for very long.I have got to say she deserves credit for being honest. But her cure for the Labor Party's irrelevancy is a real worry. In this comprehensive article, which I am happy to table, she refers to the irrelevance of the branch structures. She says that what Labor needs are new types of branch structures like Green Labor, union Labor, global Labor, community Labor, young Labor, family Labor, country Labor. Country Labor was an absolute failure! I say why stop there. Why don't the Labor Party have branches of `hard' Labor. They could have `new, better tasting' Labor. They could have Labor `lite' and they could even have `I can't believe it's not Labor' Labor. The only policy they have here is `lazy' Labor. - This is just lazy Labor and, no matter what they try to do to relabel their branches, it is about substance, and young Australians will not be conned by fresh packaging of a tired, old product. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Well, Labor certainly were robbed, weren't they? The Liberal and National parties are the only parties in this House that are dealing with the aspirations of, and providing the opportunities for, young Australians, not lazy Labor, who have got no substance - and it is all about labels.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his very nice question with notice, and -  -  - Mr Speaker, I thought I had the call. - I again say that I appreciate the very nice question with notice. Let me make just a couple of points: as you know, the Prime Minister released a statement on this shortly before he left. He indicated that he has received the report, he has passed it on to former ministers Fahey and Wooldridge. I am not in a position to advise as to whether they have yet responded, and I am happy to establish whether or not they have responded and, if necessary, come back to you. The government has not made a decision on whether the reports ought to be released. We have heard a lot of wild allegations here about scandalous behaviour and what you have you. I just want to make a couple of points about that. Firstly, we have given a very clear commitment that neither of the two programs in question here - relating to asthma and medical specialist programs in rural and regional Australia - will be compromised in the amount of funding that we have provided to both. But I think the really important point that must be made here - you always need a bit of balance in these things; there has been a bit of a focus on this issue and it has obscured the really important matter - is that this government has acted to address the quite scandalous crisis in the provision of rural and regional health involving GPs and specialists in particular but nurses as well, a crisis set up and almost, it would seem, deliberately mapped out and planned for by those responsible for health in this country during the years that Labor was in power. The intake -  -  - The fact of the matter is that it has been well known for a very long time in this country that, if you want to ensure an adequate supply of medical practitioners and allied health providers in rural and regional Australia, you have to train enough people from rural and regional Australia in those areas. Under your regime, the intake in some of our medical schools got down to one, two, three or four per cent - not the 25 or 30 per cent needed. The work that Dr Michael Wooldridge did with the government's support, and in respect of which certainly I worked alongside him, to correct that situation I think was outstanding. He deserves commendation for it, and in any balanced assessment of the government's performance in this area our record leaves yours for dead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. In fact, I look forward to joining him on the Gold Coast on Saturday morning, because Surf Lifesaving Australia are one of our Harmony Day partners. They have dedicated Saturday as Diversity Day, so they are doing their part to promote harmony in our very culturally diverse society. This year's Harmony Day -  just four years on since the senior minister, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, commenced this particular project - is in fact bigger than last year. There are some 2,234 organisations involved in events around Australia, while last year there were just 800. It proves that millions of Australians are embracing the concept of harmony in our culturally diverse society. In addition, 12,000 education kits have been distributed to primary schools. In fact, I was in the electorate of my ministerial colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth, the member for Richmond, at Centaur Public School to launch that in mid-February. Those kits have gone over very well. There are 750,000 stickers for kids and 550,000 ribbons - and it's good to see the leadership of the Acting Prime Minister in wearing one today - and for those members who are minus their ribbons, there is next year, because Harmony Day next year is going to be bigger, if you do your part.Members may care to consult the Adelaide Advertiser. Rex Jory, the columnist, today has really summed up, I believe, what Harmony Day is all about and the way that citizenship can unite us as a country. He says:Harmony Day this year will highlight the potential benefits for business in harnessing the different languages, competencies and cross-cultural skills of Australia's community, but the overriding aim is to encourage Australia's 900,000 eligible permanent residents who have not yet sought to become Australian citizens to take the step. Whether you have been here for five years, five generations or you can actually trace your family history back thousands of years to the original Australians and their descendants, Harmony Day is a perfect opportunity for you to showcase who you are, your cultural beliefs and get to know your fellow Australians.The Howard government allocated $2.5 million in last year's budget, and that extended the Living in Harmony initiative, with 37 new grants and six new partnerships. Partners in the corporate sector - Ford, AMP, Coca-Cola Amatil, Cadbury Schweppes, Drake, Microsoft, McDonald's, Telstra and Woolworths - ought to be congratulated, because these are businesses that recognise that out of our culturally diverse community come a great range of skills, a huge potential to advance the production and the capacity of all Australia's businesses - a great way to promote additional trade because of the skills we have in our work force. Australia is a complex, cosmopolitan society. We cannot take any of all that we have achieved to date for granted and we have to keep working on it - and that is the significance of Harmony Day.</DOC>

 - My recollection is that the outcome of the audit which was provided to the Liberal Party was announced by Lynton Crosby - I believe, late last year. Of course, any tax audit is a matter between the commissioner and the person that was actually audited; it is not a matter for the government to release it. It was an audit which was provided to the Liberal Party, and Mr Crosby released a statement in relation to that.What I am not aware of is this: there was an undertaking by the now member for Brand for an audit of the Victorian ALP. That, of course, can only be requested by the Victorian ALP. As far as I know, the Victorian ALP has never been to the tax office to ask for that audit, nor has it ever released a statement about the conduct or outcome of that audit. I do recall very clearly that undertaking having been given by the member for Brand. We are still waiting for him to come good in relation to it.</DOC>

I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to turn up at 7.30 tonight. He will learn a lot, and he will hear an excellent budget speech. Could I also take the opportunity to remind the Leader of the Opposition that the family with three children for which he professes such concern and compassion is infinitely better off now than it was six years ago.</DOC>

 - A number of things will determine the future of our country: contrary to popular belief, it is not always the things that we know but so often the things that we do not. What is clear in examining Australia's future is that Australian higher education - Australian universities - will play a critical role in terms of our future. For that reason, on behalf of the government I have announced that there will be a review of Australian higher education. To that end, I have released the first of what will be a series of six discussion papers to inform public debate on these issues. I have also established a specialist unit within the Department of Education, Science and Training, to which has been seconded Mr Bob Goddard, from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. I have also had seconded from the Business Council of Australia a person who will work with the secretariat, because it is increasingly important for us to understand that one of the many issues facing Australian higher education is the extent to which we can see more private sector or business investment in Australian universities. Further to that, I have established a reference group which will guide me directly throughout the process of the review.The member for Casey has a longstanding interest in, and commitment to, Australian universities. On this side in particular we realise - and in fact I think it is important for all of us as Australians, whatever side of the House we are on in the parliament, whatever our politics or wherever we live, to realise - that we have a number of key issues we need to look at in relation to universities. What defines, in the 21st century, a university, in terms of research, teaching and scholarship? Who is going to university and why are they going there? Why are drop-out rates, for example, as high as four out of 10 in some cases and for Aboriginal students nearly 60 per cent? Why can't we get more business sector or private sector investment and engagement in Australian universities? How can we put a stronger floor under our regional institutions, to recognise the complex and demanding community service obligations that they are meeting? We also need to be looking at the commercialisation of ideas, of intellectual property in Australian universities. Amongst other things, I have also said to the secretary of my department, who is doing an outstanding job, that I think we need to get the Commonwealth government out of the extent to which it regulates and controls Australian universities. I remain to be convinced that the level of accounting, red tape and reporting which comes to me is absolutely necessary for the good functioning of Australian higher education. In relation to the review - in concluding - you should know that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee president, Professor Deryck Schreuder, said:... this significant document will set the scene for addressing the urgent financing and structural needs of Australia's universities.In a balanced way, the paper outlines the problems and issues currently facing Australia's universities. We are very keen to be a part of the process ...I might also say that the Group of Eight of Australia's leading universities, as they describe themselves, have declared their support for the review and commended the government for:... recognising the crucial part that universities will play in determining economic and social well-being for Australians in the twenty-first century. There has been another comment, by the member for Jagajaga and Senator Kim Carr. I should give some publicity to this release, because nobody else did. It said:Brendan Nelson's Report Higher Education at the Crossroads released today is a blueprint for increasing fees for students and reducing the number of university places.It needs to be said that there are some issues that are so important that they should rise above the day-to-day mediocrity that comes from the opposition, and one of them is thinking about our future in terms of higher education. - I have not criticised the opposition for these facile remarks, but the member for Jagajaga and others on the other side know that there are critical policy issues to be considered in relation to higher education, and it is extremely important. I will keep my door open, so if the opposition choose to engage themselves in this public policy debate there is an opportunity to do so - or, as with so many other things, you can leave yourselves behind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I had the pleasure of being in his electorate for a community meeting around the issues of a national ageing strategy just a week ago. It is interesting that the electorate of Moore has nine per cent of its population over the age of 65, which is below the national average of 12 per cent, but about a third of the population are aged between 40 and 65, which means they will be part of this great movement through the population over the next 20 years. This series of community meetings which I have conducted in Pinjarra, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, in Echuca, in Colac, in the member for Grey's electorate, in Glenelg and elsewhere around Australia has given Australians an opportunity to participate in the way in which we develop a national ageing strategy and continue to put the policies and programs in place which will be part of this massive demographic change in the Australian population. As part of identifying the needs of an ageing population, the Treasurer this evening will be releasing, as part of the budget, an intergenerational report. This benchmark report will set out the expected demographic changes over the next 40 years and indicate some of the consequences of those changes, based on current policy projections. What we will be doing, as a government, is building upon this work which has been undertaken for the Intergenerational Report, to look at where we want to be as a nation in two to three decades time and what policy changes we will put in place to achieve that outcome.</DOC>

 - The government is examining this, including - as part of that examination obviously - the cost implications of the recommendations that are contained in the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's report. I met her and the head of the Office of the Status of Women 10 days ago to discuss that issue and matters relating to it. I think any government needs a range of policies to deal with issues relating to the balance of work and family. I do not think there is any one single answer to the falling fertility rate in this country; I think there are a combination of reasons for that. I think policies in this area have got to be designed not only to try and address that but also, importantly, to relieve some of the pressure on family budgets, particularly when the first child comes along, which, from the experience of those on both sides of the House, is often the most expensive time of all. That is of course why we introduced the baby bonus - in order to recognise that.It is no secret that we are examining that report, and we are engaging in discussion on it. It is also no secret that the government hold a view that there should not be unreasonable burdens placed on small business in relation to this matter because that could be counterproductive for the target group of any such measure. If the Leader of the Opposition is interested in this issue - the whole issue - I would welcome any thoughts he has. I always study what he says very carefully. It is always a great font of information. I would be very happy to examine it, but I just remind the Leader of the Opposition and all of those who are interested in this debate that we should reject the sort of one size fits all approach to family policies. You have got to have a mix; you have to recognise that there are different groups in the community who have different needs. I will welcome any contribution the Leader of the Opposition makes to the debate.I conclude my remarks by saying that the position of Australian families in terms of support from the government, low interest rates, higher real wages, and greater opportunities and choice for women, in particular, has vastly improved over the last six years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Certainly all Australians are dismayed at the signing of the new US farm bill by the President. It entrenches a regime of subsidies in the US farm system which will guarantee that US farmers are, in more than 50 per cent of cases, more dependent on government welfare assistance and subsidies than they are on the real worth of their labours. That kind of approach clearly undermines the competitiveness of US agriculture and breeds complacency and inefficiencies in their agricultural production.The nature of their farm bill program provides increased subsidies in circumstances where prices are low. As a result, instead of market signals demonstrating to US farmers that they should be cutting their production because the world does not need their product, they are actually encouraged to grow more. So the mountains get higher, that product is then dumped on world markets and that has an impact on Australian farmers endeavouring to sell our unsubsidised product into that kind of marketplace. The reality is that this new farm bill has been widely condemned by farmers around the world - not just from Australia but from our Cairns Group partners, all of whom are horrified by the example that the United States are setting as we move into an important new round of world trade talks.It is also interesting to note that it is not just Australia and some other countries that are appalled at the behaviour of the United States in relation to its farm bill. I was interested in some of the comments by US congressmen themselves. For instance, representatives John Boehner from Ohio and Cal Dooley from California said that they regarded this farm bill as a giant leap backwards in US agricultural policy and they even suggested that it could violate US trade commitments. - What about Pennsylvanian Republican, Pat Toomey -  - who said that this farm bill -  - represents `a step toward Soviet style agriculture'? He said that the US was in danger of turning its farmers into serfs dependent upon communal subsidies. So there is widespread recognition in the United States that this is inappropriate policy. Subsidies start at 10 per cent and they help a few people, but then there is a demand for 20 per cent or 30 per cent. Why stop at 50, 100 or 200 per cent? The reality is that subsidies do not work. They fail to achieve levels of efficiency, they fail to achieve improvements in agricultural lifestyle and in fact they end up delivering waste and inefficiency.The government has been strong and active in pursuing the US administration in an endeavour to ensure that their farm subsidies are delivered in a way that affects in as least possible a manner those who trade fairly and freely around the world. We have received certain assurances, but a lot more needs to be done. Our policy and our efforts contrast sharply with the incompetence of the opposition in regard to these matters. They cannot make up their mind what they want. In fact, some members of the opposition, including somebody who masquerades as a trade spokesman, are actually suggesting that we should now break off discussions with the United States, particularly in relation to negotiating a fairer trade deal, because somehow or other this bill destroys the need for that kind of activity. The reality is that it makes it even more important for us to endeavour to negotiate a satisfactory arrangement. That is what we will be setting as our task: achieving the best possible arrangements for Australian farmers in the very worst possible circumstances. I deplore the US farm bill. But we will not just talk; we will act and get on with the business of ensuring that Australian farmers get the very best possible deal in these hopeless circumstances.</DOC>

 - I assume you are referring to the SACS Award. - It is important to recognise that, as the Treasurer stated to Michael Egan last year, the Commonwealth's position is very clear. Under many state-Commonwealth agreements - the major one is the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement - the funding increases that we have put through, through indexation increases, have been passed on now for a number of years. - That was, of course, to recognise future wage increases. - We believe that the increases that we put through on indexation were to the benefit of the New South Wales government and helped compensate for the increases in wages that were brought down by the industrial commission last November. It is very clear. Perhaps the pressure that you should put in place should be upon your colleagues in the New South Wales government because of the increased revenue that they are getting through the GST, stamp duty and gambling taxes. - When it comes to young children, particularly those who have disabilities, and children in the mainstream, I want to ensure that they are adequately catered for. But it is very disingenuous of you and the New South Wales government to try to shift blame onto the Commonwealth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I had the pleasure of being out in his electorate of Kalgoorlie. There is a lot of fine work being conducted out there, as there is in electorates right across Australia. I am pleased to inform the member for Kalgoorlie and the parliament that Work for the Dole has gone another step forward by providing significant work opportunities for people in Perth, in a pilot project of national significance which commenced on 29 April. With the National Archives we are going to work with old handwritten records, dating back as far as 1898, which record the ships that arrived in Australia with the new migrants - migrants obviously make up a large proportion of Australia's population today - and record all of the details provided right through to the present day.This will provide a valuable record for future generations in Australia as they will be able to go back through the archives electronically and look at the databases and find family, friends and significant persons. They will be able to find out when those people arrived in this country, how they arrived, their port of embarkation et cetera. This is significant because we have unemployed people who are making a contribution not only today in their community but also into the future, for future generations - something for which they can hold their heads up very proudly and speak of the contribution they have made to their nation. This is another important, positive step forward, both for the unemployed and for the Work for the Dole program. It goes to show that the work that these people can undertake is valuable in their communities and will continue to be so. This government remains very committed to the Work for the Dole program and those who participate in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for that question and her demonstration of raising issues in this place which directly affect the people she represents. It is a fact that country people take very seriously and with great concern the closure of any institution within their community, particularly the closure of a bank. As a consequence, the government has taken a number of measures to which I will refer in a moment. In addition, since I have been appointed to this position I have actually had direct consultation with very senior banking officials to see how we can improve the arrangements and give better services to people in every area.In those discussions, I can inform the member, the National Australia Bank advised me that, consistent with their decisions and their arrangements on recent announced closures, in every case - including Violet Town - they have made arrangements with the local post office agent to commence providing a full service as compared to the existing agency service, which the member clearly indicated in her question. The Violet Town bank was not open continuously; it was only open on the odd days or for odd hours, and in fact the new service will be continuous. But it is not my intention to accept that as the perfect solution. I see all of these bank closures as work in progress to get better outcomes for the people.Nevertheless, the government implemented the rural transaction centre policy for the purpose of replacing services that were lost in small communities. I thank the Prime Minister for opening one the other day. - In many circumstances I have been in communities that lost a bank and have recovered a banking service, a Centrelink service, a Medicare service and other services they have never had. This can be sophisticated. I am looking forward to coming back into this House in a reasonably short period to announce other measures which will not lead to the reduction of services in these communities but measures which will increase the services, be they financial or be they the sorts of services that our government will continue to provide. We have good members who do not exploit their constituents to make a political point. They get on with the job of helping their constituents.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Macarthur, who is a renowned tourist, having travelled right around Australia on foot. He knows many parts of Australia that I think most members in the House would not be aware of. He also has an electorate that has a budding interest in tourism. In fact, we were out there recently for the launch of the Macarthur tourism forum. It was one of the more professional presentations from a community, which was coming together to promote the Macarthur area as a region for weekend tourism or overnight stays just outside Sydney.As the member for Macarthur knows, tourism has a very important role to play in the development of all parts of Australia, particularly regional Australia, and as the member for Macarthur knows it is a vital employer out there. More than half a million Australians are directly employed in the tourism industry. It represents nearly five per cent of the Australian economy and is in fact one of our largest exports. That is why the Prime Minister asked me to develop in consultation with the industry a 10-year plan for the future of the tourism industry. The discussion paper, which we released at an Australian tourism export conference -  - That is right; the member for Cunningham has it. We released it in Adelaide, and it was pleasing to see that more than nine members of the coalition, including three parliamentary secretaries, were at that conference representing their interests. All of the members are about promoting tourism in their region and they all have a keen interest in the 10-year plan.When tourism does go through difficult times - as it did after the September 11 terrorist attacks and also after the collapse of Ansett on September 14 - this government has shown that it is prepared to stand up for the industry, and will continue to do so. The development of the 10-year plan leading to a white paper for tourism is the most significant step forward for the tourism industry in some years. It importantly represents an opportunity for the tourism industry to develop risk management strategies and to put in place investment strategies that ensure that they can access the $600 billion of superannuation funds, which have a very low level of investment in tourism infrastructure today. It also means an opportunity to help to use aviation and other forms of transport as better means of improving tourism access to regional Australia and, significantly, it means that we can work out exactly where we want the tourism industry to go, in partnership with government, over the next 10 years. That is important because over the next 10 years the number of inbound tourists to Australia will double from its current five million people a year to 10 million people. Of the 10 million, more than 50 per cent will come from non-Japan Asia, which means we need to ask whether we have the language skills in Australia, and whether we have the talent and the capability, to be able to respond and provide appropriate services to those people who may be coming to visit our shores. - Despite the cries from the Acting Leader of the Opposition, I do welcome the fact that the member for Cunningham indicated in front of 500 people at this conference that the opposition was prepared to offer bipartisan support for this plan. I see that as an important step forward, because we are in this place all determined to try and help the tourism industry to grow, to employ more young Australians and, importantly, to help develop regional Australia to the capacity that we all know it has.</DOC>

I told him of our very strong view that it would be very preferable for those war graves not to be disturbed should the French determine that they need another airport in that part of France. Indeed, he assured me that they were at that time some time away from making any definitive decisions about the airport and where it would go.He undertook to consult very closely; firstly, at the level of the War Graves Commission - and I must say our commissioners do a very fine job of representing our interests in that regard - and, secondly, at ambassadorial level, not only with Australia but with other countries that might be affected. The Battle of the Somme, for example, was not simply a battlefield as you and I might think of it - it was a very large front. There are graveyards scattered over a very wide area indeed of that part of France, reflecting the tragedies of many conflicts in days gone by. He also undertook to consult properly at a government to government level. For that, we are genuinely appreciative. The new French transport minister said last week that the project itself might well have to be fully reconsidered. He was himself not convinced of the need to build an airport in that region. My view is that we will need to remain vigilant. We will need to continue to stay in close consultation with the French on this matter and continue to press our strong views.I should say to the House - and I say this very sincerely - that I was struck, as indeed were so many Australians that I met subsequently at Anzac Cove, by the genuine respect of the French people for the contribution that Australians made in securing their freedom in both the first war and the second war. That respect is certainly alive and well amongst the thousands of Australians, in particular young Australians, who attend Anzac Day services in Gallipoli itself. I had the privilege of attending - along with some other members of this House from both sides - the service this year. The Governor-General was present; he spoke very eloquently on behalf of all Australians. I was greatly sobered, as I think all who have been there are, by the experience of being present.I saw some comment - I am not sure it was well-advised comment - about the behaviour of some young Australians. I make the observation that I was not present prior to the main ceremony, the dawn service, and it seems not unreasonable to assume that some people enjoying the spirit of the moment might have been `enthusiastic', I suppose you could say. Every Australian can be very proud about the way their representatives - young, old; male, female; country, city - behaved, their dignity and the quiet sense of respect that they displayed at the services this year in Gallipoli.As so many young people have written to me - in the way they do now, via email - it is a very moving experience, particularly for young Australians seeking to understand what it is to engage in the great privilege of being Australian and to understand what our forebears went through for us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I acknowledge the presence in the House of the Acting Leader of the Opposition. If question time today was so important to the opposition, why isn't the Leader of the Opposition here in question time today? - Obviously, the integrity of the electoral roll is vital to the functioning of any healthy democracy. Unfortunately, the roll, as things stand, is not entirely tamper proof. Unfortunately, it is not fraud proof. The sad truth is that as things stand it is easier to get onto the electoral roll of this country than it is to sign up at the local video store. The government are very keen to try to change this situation. Last year we tabled regulations providing that new enrollees produce at least one piece of documentary ID and requiring that new enrollees have their applications signed.I am sorry to tell the House that this very day in the Senate the opposition are moving a disallowance motion against these regulations. They are doing it today, the busiest day in the parliamentary year, in the hope that no-one will notice. They are doing this like thieves in the middle of the night. We have noticed, and the Australian people will notice too.As the Shepherdson inquiry revealed last year, members opposite belong to a party which believes that whole families should inhabit a single post-office box. That is the standard of members opposite. Where is the evidence of change that was supposed to take place under the leadership of the new Leader of the Opposition? On the basis of what the opposition are doing today, the best you can say about them is that they may not be the perpetrators of fraud, but they are certainly the protectors of fraud. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come back into this chamber and stand up for democratic principles.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I just take the opportunity of saying what an excellent job I think the member for Farrer is doing. People speak very highly of her as a local member. Not surprisingly, she is concerned about an issue like the US farm bill, and rightly so. First of all, I confirm what the -  - Mr Speaker, they love me over there and I can understand that. The bourgeois Left jabbering away, lost in the wilderness -  -  - They are off again! It is easy to rev up the bourgeois Left! - The US farm bill is something that this government strongly objects to, and the minister for agriculture has, in a very articulate way, explained our objections. There is no doubt that over the years this government and its predecessors have frequently been confronted by problems with US agricultural policy and, as you will have noticed recently, with the steel sector as well. I think the government did very well to get the concessions we did get for our steel industry, but that is not to say that we regard the US steel decision as being an appropriate decision for international trade. -  - As one member interjects, we did not do so well on the US farm bill. Of course, nor did the previous Keating and Hawke governments do very well on this issue either. I was the shadow minister for trade at the time: I remember it only too well. One of the solutions in relation to the farm bill - and there are many approaches to this - is to look at our options in the World Trade Organisation. Another very significant issue for this government is that we believe that many of the trade obstacles we have with the United States can be put to rest once and for all by negotiating successfully a free trade agreement with the United States. Some time ago I believe the Australian Labor Party supported a free trade agreement with the United States. On 23 January the member for Cunningham said that the Prime Minister, who was on his way to the United States at that time, had to return from the United States `with Bush's signature on an FTA if the trip was in any way to be considered a success' and that it was `a test of the alliance'. Then on 13 February the member for Cunningham accused the government of having no real commitment to an FTA with the US because it was too difficult. But then, on 7 March - so we have now gone to the third month of the year - the member for Cunningham said, `To continue these FTA negotiations with the US while Australian steel makers are desperately trying to avoid job losses would be demeaning for Australia, and send the wrong signal internationally.' So we said, `Oh, the Labor Party has changed its position on the FTA with the United States.' The member for Cunningham then stood up and took a personal explanation in the parliament. - And he is about to take another one. We will be interested to hear what it is because, on 14 March, he said in a personal explanation that he supported a free trade agreement with the United States. But last week he said, `Labor is not inclined to support the Howard government's proposed FTA with the US. Only the WTO can help Australia now.' Three positions - four months. It sums up the Labor Party, you know. First of all, you have no idea what you think. You have not got any idea what is in your own heads. Secondly, you play footsy with the -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. When you are looking at the interface of city and country, you never rule anything out completely and you are always open to new ideas and new suggestions. From what I have seen of the zone taxation proposals, I do not see them as being the cure-all for what has been identified as the difficulties, the higher costs and challenges of rural living.I point out to the honourable member that it is not all doom and gloom in the bush. The honourable member is very familiar with the city of Tamworth. My understanding is that the city of Tamworth is growing. It is the case that you really have a number of currents that work in non-metropolitan Australia. You have the challenge of declining very small country towns. I visited one of those not so long ago. In fact, only last week I was in the electorate of the member for Riverina, and I went into the wonderful community of Ganmain, which has a population of 250. I opened a rural transaction centre and, after moving around and talking to the folk at that particular gathering, it was very obvious that in that part of New South Wales there have been better seasons. People are getting better prices. I find that an almost universal refrain as I go around rural Australia is how grateful people are that interest rates are now down from the levels they were a few years ago. One thing that country people hate more than anything else is high interest rates.I say to the honourable member that, as well as the challenge of the small country towns, you have the phenomenon, which I know he would be aware of, of the growth in population of the large hub cities in non-metropolitan Australia. We have to find policies which address all of the challenges. I do not rule things out, but I am unpersuaded by some of the arguments that are being advanced in relation to further boosting zonal taxation. We do have some zonal taxation arrangements now. Clearly, because the amounts have not been altered dramatically over the years, they are not as valuable as they used to be. There are horrendous difficulties in trying to define the boundaries. Where do you stop? Where do you start? What do you do with the people who feel that they are left out of the zone? You will have endless arguments in relation to that.Our view is that if you can run strong generic economic policies, have a highly competitive exchange rate (which I think Australia does have a the present time), have  industrial relations policies superior to those we used to have 10 years ago (which we certainly do have now), have dramatically lower interest rates than we had 10 years ago (which is certainly the case), have much lower inflation than we had 10 years ago (which is certainly the case), have the greatest asset of all that the bush has - that is, extremely efficient farmers and producers -  then Australia is positively facing its challenges in rural and regional Australia. And I add my voice of criticism to the US farm bill. The US farm bill is a kick in the shins for the efficient farmers of Australia. There is the behaviour of both the United States and the European Union. Whenever you are criticising restrictive and anticompetitive agricultural policies, never exclude the European Union, because the European Union's predatory trading behaviour is infinitely worse than that of other countries.I say to all of those in the House who are concerned about the future of country Australia that this government will retain an open mind about policy options. Quite apart from cost, there are problems with a dramatic expansion of existing zone taxation arrangements. The problems of demarcation are principal amongst those problems, but I can assure the honourable member that we will keep an open mind about policies. Rural Australia is now doing somewhat better than was the case a few years ago. I hope the drought being experienced in some parts is relieved because country people certainly deserve the better seasons and the better prices they are now getting. They have had some very tough years, and my sympathies continue to lie very much with the people of country Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I welcome the very great interest in local and national environmental issues that he brings to this chamber. The Natural Heritage Trust has already achieved probably the greatest mobilisation of Australian communities on behalf of the environment that this country has ever seen. Over 400,000 people have been involved in some 12,000 local community projects through the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust. Volunteers have planted some 29 million seedlings, and some 780,000 hectares of native vegetation have been replanted or protected. Nearly eight million hectares have been added to the national parks estate.That is a quite remarkable record, and I do not believe any program of any federal government has ever gone so far to mobilise local communities and focus them on the need to build the foundations for a sustainable Australia at the local level. As part of the second phase of the Natural Heritage Trust - the additional $1 billion that the government has put in to the Natural Heritage Trust from consolidated revenue, in addition to the $1.5 billion resulting from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra - the government has now announced a $20 million Australian Government Envirofund. It was launched in April, and its aim is to provide local community groups with the opportunity to undertake local environmental projects; groups can be funded up to some $30,000 per project. Applications close on 5 June, with the aim of notifying successful applicants as soon as possible. I urge all those groups to take advantage of the expressions of interest that have been put out and to complete the application form.This government's commitment to the environment is in dramatic contrast to that of the Labor Party. Every year, this government spends more than twice as much as the Labor Party spent during its last year in office. The Labor Party has no known policy whatever to secure sustainability for this country. This government is putting in place an unprecedented commitment which, year by year, is transforming environmental management in Australia.</DOC>

 - I inform the House that the budget brought down by the government for the next year continues the strong economic management of the coalition government. By the end of the budget year, the government will have repaid $62 billion of Labor's debt. Can I also say that we believe that fiscal policies should support the Australian economy during a global slowdown. In the course of the last year, the United States went into recession, Japan went into recession, Germany went into recession, Singapore went into recession, Taiwan went into recession and Europe turned down, but the Australian economy was strong and fiscal policy was supportive. One of the reasons it was supportive was through the First Home Owners Scheme, which gave an enormous lift to young home buyers. That kept the Australian economy growing through a period of international downturn. There are many Australians who are in work who would not have been otherwise.If the Labor Party are interested in good, strong budget surpluses, they will give an undertaking to vote for all the measures in the budget. I do not think that the Labor Party would be so hypocritical - would they? - to say that they want strong surpluses but they will vote against every measure that is required to get there. I do not think they would try to repeat the tactic they tried in 1996, when they voted against every saving and then said they wanted budget surpluses - I would be very surprised, given the fact that the member for Fraser now says that he is interested in a strong budget. I would like to see him stand up in question time today and say, as evidence of his bona fides, that, because he now really believes in strong budget policy, the Labor Party will give a commitment to vote for all expenditure savings. We are waiting.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I can report to the House that, in 2001-02, it is expected that the Australian economy will grow by about 3¾ percent, which is the fastest growth of any economy in the G7 or major developed economies of the world. I can also report to the House that it is expected that, in 2002-03, the Australian economy will again grow faster than any of the major developed countries of the world, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and the other major economies.I can inform the member for Wannon that it is expected that, unlike other countries where unemployment is growing, unemployment in Australia will fall. We are forecasting that it will fall to six per cent by June next year. If the Australian economy were to grow at current rates and we were to persist with labour market reform and welfare reform - and I believe we should because they are so important - we could even have an unemployment rate below six per cent in a couple of years. Since 1996, the Australian economy has generated over 900,000 new jobs and, at the current rate of job growth, by Christmas Australia could have a million new jobs. We remember that those who opposed tax reform said that the Australian economy would go into recession as a result of tax reform. We remember they said that unemployment would rise. We remember they said that Australia would turn down as the world turned up. As it was, the world turned down and Australia turned up. I want to give the House an assurance that this government will continue strong economic management, because we want to see more Australians in work. We want to see Australia continue to grow and to lead the world. We want to see Australia as a strong economy with a safe society and with secure borders under good government leadership. That is what the coalition parties in this country stand for.</DOC>

 - That is a pretty good question from the $96 billion government debt man. That is a terrific question. I am absolutely flabbergasted and flattened by that withering debating point, Mr Speaker! As I always do with these things, I will check the record because they always weave a bit in, leave a bit out and distort things. It is a bit like their projections about budget deficits. Remember the 1996 election campaign? I remember it very well. There was no Charter of Budget Honesty then. There was nothing, and they went around and misled people. I can do no better than to remind the Leader of the Opposition and to remind the House that in a year's time, after the next budget has been in operation, we will have repaid $62 billion of the $96 billion of national debt that we inherited.Can I also remind the House that we now have a government debt to GDP ratio of 4½ per cent. It is 130 per cent, or thereabouts, in Japan. I think, from memory, the OECD average is 50 per cent. It is something like 45 per cent in the United States. It is a minuscule 4½ per cent in this country, and that is the result of the good management of this government - that, more than any other fiscal policy, has taken pressure off interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition, a man who was a member of a government that drove interest rates to Himalayan levels, has got the audacity to stand up here and talk about pressure on interest rates, when a homebuyer had to pay 17 or 18 per cent, a small businessman 19 per cent, a struggling farmer weighed down by the rotten industrial relations policies of the Labor government had to pay 22 or 23 per cent - and you have got the gall to talk about interest rates!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, as the Treasurer said - and I congratulate him on his seventh budget - it is a sound and a safe budget. When it comes to interest rates in particular the last thing that rural and regional Australia would want is a return to those interest rates the Prime Minister has just so graphically described. I remember that when I came into this place the interest rates for farmers, when you added in the margins and so forth, had reached the levels of around 25 per cent. We do not want to be back there, nor does rural Australia. That is why, more than anything else, they appreciate a safe and a sound budget.We have delivered, too, on our commitments - in roads, in aviation, across the portfolios in family, business and aged care in particular. The budget reflects the government's ongoing commitment to regional Australia. There are many programs that have been built up over the years that continue on through this budget. The government will spend $1.74 billion on roads in 2002-03. That is a near-record amount. It will continue to build the national highway network and roads of national importance. We have recommitted ourselves to a further four years of the Black Spots program - the program which the Labor Party said they would abolish. They were going to give it away despite the fact that it returns an average of $14 in benefits for every dollar spent, that it has saved a very large number of Australian lives and prevented a very large number of woundings and maimings that otherwise would have happened. It is a very valuable program. We will also deliver in full the $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program. Every cent of that will be paid to local government across Australia, across the funding cycle. This is a program that the ALP described relentlessly, when we introduced it, as a boondoggle and to which they have refused to this point in time to commit themselves. It is a valuable program. It will be delivered in full.The government also continues its support for regional aviation in a number of ways - for example, the exemption of small regional airlines from the en route charges imposed by Airservices Australia. That will save the industry around $6 million this coming financial year. One small commuter airline - and we know the difficulties they face at the moment - saves $16,000 a week as a result of that exemption and is able to continue to provide services to the regional communities that depend upon it. We will spend $7 million, too, in subsidising certain very important regional control towers - Albury, Coffs Harbour, Tamworth, Launceston, Hobart, Mackay, Rockhampton, Jandakot, Parafield. Those aviation control towers help 1.5 million passengers a year move around throughout regional Australia. They are very important.The regional export businesses are being assisted through an expansion of that excellent program TradeStart. There are already 24 TradeStart offices in regional Australia. There will be an additional $21½ million spent on adding another 12 offices to this number, including in locations such as Dubbo, Emerald, Bunbury, Geelong, Mildura and Port Lincoln. There are a number of other programs - that is just an illustrative list - that will take the number up substantially across the country.I could talk for a very long time about the programs of benefit to rural and regional Australia and I would like to do so, but I particularly wanted to congratulate the Minister for Ageing for the commitment that he has shown to older Australians in the regions. There is $100 million to help small aged care homes in rural and remote areas upgrade their facilities, $47½ million to train aged care nurses in regional areas, $80 million to help Australia's 2.3 million carers, including a major commitment to improving respite services for carers in rural and remote areas. This budget reflects our ongoing and very real commitment to the people of regional Australia.</DOC>

Do you want to talk accruals? - Thank you very much! According to the MYEFO, the projected accrual deficit was minus 3.1 and, according to the budget statement last night, it was minus 3. In other words, it actually improved. So much for that searching, devastating and annihilating question from the Treasury spokesman for the opposition!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Given his vast electorate, with its thousands of kilometres of coastline, his electors have a very real interest in border protection matters. The excellent budget delivered last night by the Treasurer demonstrates quite clearly that the government is determined to maintain the integrity of Australia's borders. It shows that we are committed to running an orderly migration program and to resettling the most vulnerable of refugees who are living in appalling conditions around the world. We are dealing with the problem at its sources, and we are lifting the capacity of transit countries to deal with the issues. We are also continuing to take strong and appropriate measures within Australia.Christmas Island has been one of the main entry points to Australia for unauthorised arrivals. It has been excised from Australia's migration zone for unauthorised arrivals, so it is an appropriate place to build a detention centre. The development of the centre reinforces the message to people smugglers that mandatory detention is still firm government policy. People smugglers will not be able to deliver what their customers want, which is passage to the Australian mainland. The new permanent facility will provide higher levels of amenity, safety and security for up to 1,200 unauthorised boat arrivals. The facility will be Australia's first purpose built, purpose designed immigration reception and processing centre.We have already seen the government's policy on border protection bearing fruit. We have not had one boat arrive since December last year yet, 12 months ago, we had almost 2,400 arrive in the equivalent period. We must maintain our vigilance, and we must continue to make sure that people smugglers know their insidious trade will not succeed. The Christmas Island centre sends that message strongly and clearly - but that is not the message that the Labor Party is sending. On Queensland radio on 5 April, Premier Beattie was unambiguous with his `not in my backyard' comments. He said:I have been strongly opposed to these buildings forever and ever, and everybody knows that.South Australian Premier, Mike Rann, said on 12 April:We've told the federal government in no uncertain terms that the new Labor government does not support a second detention centre.What about today? On Tasmanian radio this morning, Labor Treasurer, David Crean, asked:Why do they have to spend exactly that amount on border security?What sort of signal does that send to people smugglers? Certainly, it does not send the message that Labor is serious about border protection or about stopping people-smuggling.</DOC>

 - I will deal with the two aspects of the question. To get a proper measure of the increased commitment of this country to defence, you have to start with the massive increases provided for in the white paper, you have to add the money that was allocated after that was brought down in relation to the activities in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the war against terror and you also have to add the additional provisions that were announced by the Treasurer last night. Let me go now to the second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question, and that is the question of the changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Let me say quite directly to the Leader of the Opposition that I think it was the responsible thing for the government to do to begin the process of bringing the cost of what is fundamentally a very good scheme - but nonetheless a scheme that runs the risk of breaking down under its own weight - under control. Anybody who had bothered to look at the projections contained in the Intergenerational Report would know that, unless something is done about the cost of this scheme, it will over time break down and the people who will suffer most are the poor, the vulnerable and the unhealthy in our community.I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: you cannot have it both ways - you cannot run around in general and say, `I'm a responsible economic manager. I'm in favour of responsible Commonwealth expenditure but when it comes to any individual decision I will take the cheapjack, politically opportunistic option of opposing it.' That is fundamentally what the Labor Party have been doing for the last six years. They left us with a deficit of $10.5 billion a year, they opposed every single attempt by the government to get the deficit back into balance and they then claimed that they would have had an even larger surplus when we got the budget into surplus. When we engaged in some necessary spending last year, they said it was irresponsible. They said it was irresponsible to spend more money on roads. You go out to rural Australia and tell the people of rural Australia that it was irresponsible to spend more money on roads! They said it was irresponsible to spend more money on salinity. You go out and tell the farmers and the townsfolk of rural Australia about that! They said it was irresponsible to spend more money on defence. They said it was irresponsible to spend more money on the First Home Owners Scheme - something that proved to be absolutely invaluable to the home building industry of Australia and, I might say, proved to be absolutely invaluable to the revenue streams of all the state Labor governments because it boosted their stamp duty receipts. In a state like Victoria where they are not indexed, they are absolutely rolling in money, yet I heard Steve Bracks on the radio this morning saying, `The Commonwealth should do this and the Commonwealth should do that.' He never discloses that Victoria is absolutely rolling in money as a result of the burgeoning stamp duty revenues.Nobody likes increasing the cost of anything - of any pharmaceutical - but we have a situation where we have a fundamentally good scheme, but something must be done about controlling its cost. That is the responsible thing to do, and that is what we are doing. The irresponsible thing to do is to run around and say, `I'm a budget balancer, I'm somebody who believes in strong economic management but, if you actually put the squeeze on me and ask me to support something that controls cost, don't expect me to do that. I'm the leader of the Australian Labor Party, and we have an absolute licence to say one thing and do something completely different.' That is fundamentally what the Leader of the Opposition is all about.Can I remind the House that since 1990 there has been something like a 250 per cent increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I also understand from the Intergenerational Report tabled last night that, unless something is done about getting greater cost control into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, it is going to something like quadruple in cost over the next few years. It is the fastest growing item in Commonwealth health expenditures. This parliament has a choice. We can play the opportunistic games of the Leader of the Opposition; we can run around and in a straight-faced way say to people, `We are in favour of responsible economic management. Elect us, we will keep the budget in balance; elect us, we will cut your tax; elect us, we will spend more money on defence; elect us, we will do all of these things.' But when it actually comes to them putting their hands up in a division, when it actually comes to doing something, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He runs from his responsibilities; he scurries away. He puts himself forward as the alternative Prime Minister of Australia and he has got a real test. I would like to repeat the question that was put to him by the Treasurer. We now have something like another 45 minutes left in question time and I would like to know from the Leader of the Opposition: if he is so upset about the very notion of a budget ever being in deficit, can we please have from the Leader of the Opposition a guarantee that the Labor Party in the Senate will pass all of the expenditure measures that were brought down in the Treasurer's budget last night? We are waiting. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is burnishing up that crown of economic responsibility. I know he is a born-again believer in surplus budgets, so all he has to do is to utter those words: `I, Simon Crean, guarantee that we will pass these measures in the Senate.' Can I say that I will be willing, I will be quite prepared - I know the Treasurer will also welcome a display of statesmanship - to extend the handshake and say congratulations to the Leader of the Opposition for demonstrating a sense of national leadership. We will welcome it; we will embrace it. We will say, `This is Simon Crean's day; he has risen to the occasion; he has shown us what he is made of.' All I want is the opportunity of saying to Simon before the day is done, `Well done, Simon. You have served your country in the right way.' </DOC>

 - Firstly, can I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and recognise the very good job he is doing representing his constituents in the Northern Territory. Mr Speaker, the honourable member asks a very important question, because there is no doubting the fact that we now live in very difficult and very dangerous times. The events of September 11 have changed the way the world works. They have reminded us of the tremendous security threats that we face, and no government of this country would be responsible if in its budget it did not place a great deal of emphasis on national security and protecting our borders. It is well known that in this budget the government has built on the very substantial increases in expenditure and improvements in the capabilities of our Defence Force which were announced in the white paper some time ago. The very specific measures that are being taken to build on our defence capabilities will not only be traditional measures, such as expanding the number of patrol boats we have; they will also be addressing some of the new and highly dangerous threats that the international community faces - threats from biological and nuclear weapons as well as more traditional threats. This is also a budget where the government, as the Attorney-General said earlier, has done a good deal to address the question of border security. We are also in this budget increasing very substantially expenditure on Australia's intelligence agencies. It is not often that we talk about these intelligence agencies but I take the opportunity of telling the House that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service is an extraordinarily able and capable organisation and that in this budget we are announcing a series of measures which will increase outlays on the Australian Secret Intelligence Service by $21.8 million over the next four years. This is a very real and a very practical way of enhancing the security of our nation. So too is improving the integrity of the Australian passport system. The funding that will be provided in the next financial year for research and development of a biometric identifier for the Australian passport will ensure that we have much greater capacity to understand who is coming into our country, and a much greater capacity to identify people holding Australian passports and the credibility of those people. It helps us to counter the problem of passport fraud and it is an example of this country once more being at the leading edge of technology. Over and above that, we are funding an Ambassador for People-Smuggling Issues, John Buckley, who has already started his work and is doing an outstanding job in promoting our interests, particularly around the region, and building on the success of the Australia-Indonesian co-hosted people-smuggling conference held earlier this year. We are also providing through our aid program substantial extra humanitarian, refugee and emergency programs. Indeed, the $116 million that we will be spending on those programs is the largest amount of money spent on those programs yet. It includes a new international refugee program of $15 million to support programs of a number of international agencies, such as the IOM - the International Organisation for Migration - the UNHCR and so on, to assist refugees and internally displaced people. This is a priority for us in our budget; it is a priority for the international community because around the world there are well over 20 million people who the UNHCR would define as refugees, and, if you took over and above that people who are internally displaced, the figures would be substantially higher than that.In conclusion, I think it is also important to understand that we will be assisting countries like Papua New Guinea and Indonesia to strengthen their legislative and national frameworks to deal effectively with people smugglers, to deal effectively with the illegal people movements and to deal effectively with other forms of transnational crime. This is an important budget because it does address these fundamental issues of national security. I think it is something the Australian public understands that the government is addressing with real resolve.</DOC>

 - Of course, the premise of the question is completely wrong and probably known to be wrong by the questioner. There is no GST on pharmaceuticals. There was none when it was introduced. There is none now. There is none as a result of last night and, frankly, your attempt to try and suggest that there is does you no credit whatsoever. The only tax that I recall that actually did apply to pharmaceuticals was the wholesale sales tax. Labor's wholesale sales tax applied, as I recall, to pharmaceuticals. I had great pleasure when the wholesale sales tax was abolished and when GST was not applied to pharmaceuticals. Can I say in relation to pharmaceuticals - and I think it is important that the Labor Party's attempt to scare pensioners and other people in our community is utterly repudiated - that the concessional rate for pharmaceutical benefits will be $4.60. That means, regardless of the cost of the prescription, for a pensioners or seniors health care card holder the cost will be $4.60. For example, last night we announced that we were entering Gleevec onto the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme. Gleevec comes onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at a cost of, per treatment, $6,745. But for a pensioner the cost is $4.60. The subsidy, out of the full price of $6,745, is $6,740. - The Commonwealth subsidy is $6,740 and the copayment is $4.60. In addition to that, where you have 52 scripts in a year, every script after that is free. So people who are heavy users, who use more than one per week, which is more than 52 in a year, get every script after 52 free. The copayment is $4.60. In relation to people who are not on the concessional rate, the increase - as was announced last night - is $6.20. This is not the cost of the script; this is the copayment.Mr Speaker, as the Prime Minister said earlier, what would you think of a political party that came in here and said, `The government should be delivering larger surpluses and, just to prove our point, we the Labor Party will vote against your savings measures'? What would you think about a political party that, on the one hand, wants to say to the Australian people they believe in surpluses, but they are just going to vote against every measure that produces them? What you would think of a political party like that is what the Australian people thought of the political party that tried that at the 1998 election and tried it at the 2001 election. Five or six years of opportunism did not pay off. The member for Werriwa was right. The member for Werriwa was right on a number of things. He was not right on everything, and the taxidrivers of Sydney can attest to that! - But he was right on one thing: he said that the policy of cynicism and opportunism never appealed to the Australian public. Whatever it was with Mr Crean as the deputy leader, it appears - believe it or not - it is going to get worse with Mr Crean as the leader. Did you think the Labor Party could get more opportunist? Is it possible for the Labor Party to get more opportunist? For five years the Labor Party went around Australia and said it was opposed to GST. It asked for votes in the 1998 election against the GST. It asked for votes in the 2001 election on the basis of roll-back. Last week, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets up and says, `We are now no longer in favour of roll-back. GST is here to stay.' Roll-back - the policy that never dared speak its name - disappeared before it appeared. Roll-back, as I said earlier on in the year, is a policy that should be put in a museum along with Phar Lap's heart, so that people can walk past and they can look at what the Labor Party once said.So they come into this parliament now and they say, `We would like a large surplus -  - there he is! - we just like to vote against everything that is required to do it.' I say this to the Labor Party: in the tactics meeting, decide what the political attack is. If the political attack is you want larger surpluses, vote for the budget. If the political attack is going to be, `We would like to go out and try and scare pensioners and other people,' come in here and say you are in favour of larger deficits. But do not try and run both. Make a decision, have some principles, stand up for a policy, throw away six years of opportunism and support the government.</DOC>

 - I would firstly like to thank the member for Dawson for her outstanding advocacy on behalf of young Australians who are trying to get careers and apprenticeships in regional and rural Australia. On this side we now know that one-third of those Australians in apprenticeships and training in fact come from rural parts of the country. The training component of this budget in itself will make an enormous and positive change to the lives of in excess of 120,000 Australians. There is $110 million extra for vocational education and training in this portfolio, in addition to $200 million more this year for employer incentives to take on apprentices and also $230 million in last year's budget for growth funding in relation to the Australian National Training Authority and TAFEs.This year funding for vocational education and training is up 5½ per cent, to $1.9 billion. The key initiatives, for the member for Dawson and those on this side who are committed to apprenticeships, include a $22.3 million program over four years to provide innovation apprenticeships to give incentives of $1,100 to employers to take 25,000 Australians, mainly young people, into apprenticeships in robotics, photonics, information and communication technology and, importantly for those concerned with manufacturing, microtechnologies in existing industries. In addition to that, there is $31.7 million for 30,000 young people - kids at school - to take on an apprenticeship while they are still at school.What that means, Mr Speaker - you imagine that - is you have got 25,000 young people in year 10, year 11 and maybe year 12 where an employer will get $750 to take one of those students into an apprenticeship in hospitality, retail management, the automotive industry, construction, commer-cial cookery and a range of things like that while they are still at school and then, if they keep employing that young person six months after they have left school, the employer will receive another $750. Those two measures will directly change the lives of at least 55,000 Australians and their families. It will give them not only hope but skills and confidence in a career that they need. This will add to the 170,000 students who are currently undertaking vocational education and training in Australian schools.I am also asked about alternative policies. It may not have come to your attention, Mr Speaker, but the Labor spokesperson for training is the member for Kingston. The member for Kingston is now sitting upright. He is a part of Labor's lost tribe. He is under Laurie Ferguson's direction down there, and he has not managed to ask me a question since I have been the minister. I presume that the member for Kingston supports school based apprentices at Morphett Vale High School and I am waiting to see his media release in support of this government initiative. I might also add that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - one heartbeat away from leadership of the Australian Labor Party - has given a 20-minute speech in this place on a matter of public importance concerning education and has not said one positive thing about apprenticeships - not one. She took 10 minutes on the ABC in Melbourne this morning arguing, incorrectly, that there is no extra money for universities or government schools, when university funding is up 5.8 per cent and government school funding is up 5.7 per cent in this budget. But there was not one positive word about apprenticeships.I challenge the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, which is supposed to be founded on representation of working people, when he stands up to ask his next question to ask indulgence of the Speaker to applaud this government for giving 55,000 Australians apprenticeship opportunities and, in particular, 30,000 Australian schoolchild-ren and their families an apprenticeship while they are still at school. If they stand for working Australians and they want to give hope to young people where it has been lost, particularly in electorates like Dawson, then stand up at the dispatch box and commit the Australian Labor Party to supporting this package of measures in training.</DOC>

 - I can confirm, as I said on radio 2UE, that the change is one dollar. The change in the concessional code payment is one dollar. As I also said, there is a safety net provision so that after you have had 52 scripts in the year the additional scripts are free. The change for a pensioner per script is one dollar, and there is a safety net arrangement which means that after 52 weeks the scripts on the PBS thereafter are free, and it does not matter whether the script costs $200 or $300 -  - I will make this point: the Labor Party wants to oppose the government's measures to make the PBS sustainable. The public ought to know that in the long term, as the Prime Minister has said, the PBS will become unsustainable and all Australians will be worse off. It is just a cynical, short-term manoeuvre. You know that this scheme needs to be put on a sustainable basis. If you do not make the moderate changes now, the changes are going to become more and more drastic. The Labor Party might think that they can get away with telling the public that no change is required. Maybe they could get away with that for a year, or maybe they could get away with it for two years, but anyone who genuinely believes in putting health on a sustainable basis in this country will be supporting these reforms. It is cynicism on the part of the Labor Party to try to pretend that nothing needs to be done, that we can have a $60 billion program, as the Intergenerational Report foreshadows, out into the future. It is cynical and opportunistic politics.The internal contradiction arises here. I like the way they do it: they have this spokesman up to make out as if he is against expenditure restraint, and they have the member for Fraser up to make out as if he is in favour of stronger surpluses - and you are only sitting two paces away from each other. The two of you should get together and work out which is your criticism of the budget. If your criticism of the budget is that you want to have stronger surpluses, then go with the member for Fraser and vote the government's budget through. If you want to go the low road and say, `We don't want to have any expenditure restraint,' then go with the member for Perth - but go one way or the other, because watching the Labor Party put one foot on one side of a barbed wire fence and the other foot on the other is becoming very painful for us to look at. Tell us what your position is. Decide what it is and come out with a coherent line. As I said before, it is the politics of opportunism, and it has been proven over the last five years that the Australian public will not warm to the politics of opportunism. You could have had no more opportunist position than to oppose tax reform. It was the easiest campaign to run in the whole of recent Australian political history: `We are against the tax base.' But could the Labor Party win one election on it? Could it win two elections on it?All of these submissions that are coming into the Labor Party's Wran report are saying, `We did not have a credible taxation policy in the Labor Party.' What does the New South Wales Labor Party say? It says Labor had no credible economic or tax policy at the last election. That is what it said. The New South Wales Labor Party said Labor had no credible economic or tax policy at the last election. I wonder who was responsible for economic and tax policy at the last election. If you want to run up to the next election with no credible policy in relation to expenses; if you want to run up to the next election with a policy of cynicism and opportunism, I think the Australian public will reward that policy in the same way. This is the government that wants to stabilise the position for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, this is the government that is doing the hard work in terms of maintaining durable services, and this is the government that really has the long-term interests of the Australian public in mind when it does that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson, the Chief Government Whip, for his question and his commitment to the frail and elderly in his electorate. This budget which the Treasurer delivered last night is good news for frail and elderly Australians. The government, through the budget, is delivering in full on its election commitments to the aged. The reality so far as ageing is concerned is that the ageing of the population, as the Intergenerational Report indicates, will have a significant impact on the economic and social fortunes of our nation. Today over two million Australians are aged 65 years and over. In the next 40 years, as the Intergenerational Report indicates, that figure is likely to triple to over six million people.Six years ago we had an aged and community care sector that was unprepared for this movement in our demographics. In fact, when Labor left office in 1996 there was a shortage - indicated by the Auditor-General in a subsequent report - of some 10,000 aged care beds in Australia. In fact, in 1986 the Labor Party had established itself a benchmark of 100 places in aged care facilities for every 1,000 people in Australia over the age of 70 and, when leaving office a decade later, it had not achieved that target whatsoever. Since coming to government, the coalition has significantly increased the funding of aged care places in Australia, and this year's budget includes an additional $211 million over four years for residential aged care subsidies. In the course of two terms in government we have increased expenditure on aged care in Australia from some $2.5 billion to well over $4 billion - an increase of some 75 per cent. This is an indication of the concern and care that the coalition has for the frail elderly in Australia. A week ago I indicated that an additional 8,000 places had been allocated for aged care in this year's round, which brings to over 32,000 the number which have been allocated in the last three years' rounds.In addition, we know that Australians wish to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, if they can appropriately. When we came to government, there were just 2,000 community aged care packages which enabled Australians to do this. Today, there are over 27,000 of those packages and we have committed almost another $70 million in this budget to expand that number of packages by 6,000 over the coming four years. In addition to that, there are measures in the budget to address the aged care work force: over $40 million, which will go towards recruitment and training of aged care nurses; 250 scholarships, worth up to $10,000 a year, to be made available to nursing students studying at regional universities; and ongoing training for up to 10,000 aged care workers in smaller nursing homes.In addition to these measures, there is a measure of some $80 million over four years for carers - those who do a wonderful job in our community, caring for people who are old, disabled and frail. We are providing an additional $20 million for carers of people with dementia, an additional $30 million for carers of our frail aged and an additional $30 million to other carers of people with disabilities. On top of that, there is an increase in the HACC funding from the Commonwealth in the coming year - an increase of 9.5 per cent over and above the HACC funding which is provided to this year. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. Of course nobody from the opposition is listening; nobody in the opposition is concerned about the elderly and the aged in Australia. If you were really concerned, you would have done something about it in the 10 years that you were in government. You failed to meet the benchmark you set for yourselves. You are not concerned about the elderly in Australia. We are concerned about them and we are doing something about it. We will continue to provide for the elderly and the frail in the Australian society - something which the opposition could not do.</DOC>

 - The benefit levels are not being cut, and you know it. I made it perfectly clear when this issue was raised with me before the budget that the eligibility rules were under study but that the benefit levels were not going to be cut. As the Leader of the Opposition has been kind enough to ask me this question, I would like to take a few moments to go back over the history of debate on this issue. I will start with a quote that I think everybody will be interested to hear. It reads:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension (DSP), which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians. ... Some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000. ... The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.The utterance was made, interestingly enough, on my birthday - 26 July 1999 - but it was uttered by the sage of Werriwa. Here it is, all his own work - Mark Latham, assistant shadow Treasurer and shadow minister for economic ownership, urban development and housing. He was then on the back bench, furiously writing articles which were getting up the nose, so to speak, of the then Leader of the Opposition, and generally aggravating the Australian Labor Party with his outbursts of candour.It does not end there. About seven months later, he said:Solutions must be found to the growth in DSP in order to ensure people with disabilities have the fullest opportunity available to reach their potential and to make their contribution.Who was that? Was that me? Was it the Treasurer? No, it was Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley. That was in a submission by the ALP to the Welfare Reform Reference Group. This is what the Treasurer was talking about a moment ago: when you are addressing one audience, you are serious, you believe in reform and you believe in long-term policy; when you are hunting around for a vote, you are Mr Opportunisms, aren't you, Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley? On 17 August 2000, Mark Latham said:... McClure has got it right. He is saying that we should treat mildly disabled Australians seriously. We should back up 30 years of rhetoric that says, `Don't write these people off ... Actually give them a chance to exercise their capacities ... emphasise the capacity that mildly disabled people have to work.'Again, Mark Latham said - and this is probably the best one of all, and let me say that these are not words that I would use or endorse:I think blind Freddy out there in Australia can see that we don't have one out of eight Australian men in their fifties disabled, totally incapable of work. ... Everyone knows that the system is being abused - this is Mark Latham saying this - But for those who've got a capacity to work, we should support that and give them the assistance to find work. The whole emphasis of welfare policy should be much more on capacity than incapacity.There you are, Mr Speaker: spokesman after spokesman has argued that the reform ought to be undertaken but, as soon as a government has the courage to introduce the measure, they immediately go to water and lapse into opportunism, and they are going to vote against this. They are working themselves up to vote against this and also to vote against the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is typical of the Australia Labor Party. When they are in government or when they are trying to advocate a policy position, they put down a certain attitude, but when they are put to the test and their feet are put to the fire in respect of supporting what the government is going to do in an area, they go to water completely. That, of course, is true in disability support and it is also true in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.I will end on this note. Let me quote a Labor Party spokesman on this issue. When he was talking about the escalating cost of the scheme he said - and these words should ring in the ears of every member in this House:The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would be available only to the wealthy. Those were the words of the former Treasurer and former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating when introducing the 1990 budget. You have Keating, Latham and Swan; one after the other they are saying that we have to have the courage to face these issues but, when given the opportunity to do that and when they have to respond to a measure put down, they cut and run like the gutless political failures they really are.</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Deakin, as I can inform members opposite and all of Australia, that this year's Howard budget has delivered in full every commitment that this government made in the last election campaign to Australia's unemployed. The budget announcements build on the success of the Job Network since 1998 and we are now delivering more jobs from more sites at far less cost than Simon Crean, when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training with his failed Working Nation, could ever have dreamt he could achieve. That was an ineffective, costly system which was not capable of delivering anything whatsoever for Australia's unemployed. From July 2003, Australia's job seekers -  - If the Leader of the Opposition requires clarification, I was pointing out to the House that when he was the failed employment minister he spent $3 billion on employment services and failed to create jobs for Australia's unemployed. From July 2003 -  - From July 2003, Australian job seekers will be part of an enhanced Job Network service modelled on an active participation. We now know from longitudinal studies that activity equals outcomes and outcomes equal jobs. That is what the Howard government delivers to Australia's unemployed. This government has been part of creating 900,000 jobs and, by the end of the year, we hope the figure will be one million. The member for Deakin asked me what enhancements will be made. First of all, by expanding our job placement services, we will be providing through the Australian Job Search web site far more jobs for Australia's welfare recipients - opportunities for them to get into work. We will also be establishing a job seeker credit. This is a job seeker account into which we put $850 which can only be spent on the unemployed; it is not money that can go to the Job Network member's bottom line, and it can deliver services like clothing, training or transport - anything that will help Australia's unemployed back into the work force. As I have said, it cannot be retained by the Job Network members on their bottom line. - I was also asked how the government will ensure that these people who are looking for work will receive the highest possible services. Through the enhanced Job Network, we will deliver a better targeted, more flexible, individualised responsive system based on maintaining a high level of activity by job seekers. All of this will be underpinned by a service guarantee. The unemployed will know what they are going to be able to receive and the type and frequency of services from their Job Network members. That is a great move forward from any previous employment services provided by the Labor Party.These new measures have been welcomed by a lot of groups as diverse as the Council of Social Services, Mission Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This budget delivers enhanced employment services to Australia's unemployed, and it delivers 100 per cent on our election commitments. The member for Werriwa said on Channel 7 on 1 August 1999:But for those who've got a capacity to work, we should support that and give them the assistance to find work.To answer the question thrown up by the member for Werriwa - referring to the statements made by the Prime Minister regarding DSP and those coming back to employment - I can tell the member for Werriwa that Job Network and the Howard government will deliver just that, because we believe in giving people a chance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question on this. I remind him of his words that `solutions had to be found' to the growth in DSP. That was his statement: `solutions had to be found to the growth'. So, in other words, the opposition cannot have it both ways. - The opposition cannot, in the form of the member for Lilley and the member for Werriwa, go running around the country saying, in general, `Oh, isn't this terrible? It is getting too expensive and people are rorting it and we have got to do something about it.' You talk about 200,000; your mate from Werriwa is talking about 500,000 as being the number of people who he reckons ought not to be on it. So you cannot have it both ways. You cannot, in one guise, trying to scrounge and gather a little bit of credibility as some kind of latter-day economic reformer, go running around the country saying, `Look, give us the reins of government and we will rein all these programs in and take the responsible decisions.' The decisions that were announced last night by the Treasurer will come into force, subject to the passage of the legislation, on 1 July 2003.In relation to people who are currently on the DSP, they will be progressively reviewed by Centrelink, under the new rules, within a five-year period starting on 1 July next year. People will be exempt from the review if they are within five years of age pension age, terminally ill, a Veterans' Affairs TPI pensioner, permanently blind or clearly unable to work. In addition, people who work at less than award wages - and this is an important qualification - will not in any way have their pension affected. Detailed guidelines for the Centrelink reviews will be completed after the legislation is passed. These guidelines will allow individual circumstances to be taken into account, as is done elsewhere in the social security system. That is the framework.This is a genuine attempt by this government to get control over a program that both the member for Werriwa and the member for Lilley have said is being rorted. This is a stark opportunity for this opposition to discharge its responsibilities as the alternative government of this country. They get up here at question time and they say, `The surplus should be bigger. You should be even more responsible than you are. We believe in fiscal rectitude.' But, when it comes to the opportunity of actually putting up their hands and voting for an initiative of this government which is designed to address some of these problems, what do they do? They threaten to vote against it. I think the disability support pension system does need to be brought under control, and any person on either side of this House who believes in a decent social welfare policy will support that approach. I am appealing to those people in the opposition who are interested in genuine public policy to provide for long years ahead for this country. They have an opportunity to address two areas which are exploding and, unless we do something about them, both of those areas will undermine our capacity to deliver additional dollars in other areas of vital need.The member for Werriwa knows that, the member for Lilley knows that, and I reckon there are a lot of other people in the opposition who know it also. But the person who has to do something about that knowledge is the man who sits opposite me at the dispatch box. If he wants to run away from his responsibilities today, he has an opportunity tomorrow night. I think the Treasurer and I will turn up tomorrow night and we will be all ears: we will be waiting to listen to what he has to say. But, importantly, the Australian people will want to know whether this man's promise - and he has now been the Leader of the Opposition for six months - to give a real alternative for the Australian people means anything, or whether he is just another cheapjack opportunistic Labor leader. He has an opportunity to do this, but his attempts so far do not give any encouragement that he is any different. In fact, I think this Leader of the Opposition is even more opportunistic than his predecessor.</DOC>

 - Just before question time the member for Herbert came to me and said that we should let the secret out: last night's budget was very good for Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. It is good because it helps to provide safety and security for Australia, and that helps to maintain business confidence. Importantly, the budget keeps consumer confidence high. Specifically, the government has allocated $60 million over the next four years for the Small Business Assistance Program. Under that program, $36 million will be made available for skills development and small business incubators. Recently, I was with the member for Eden-Monaro at the opening of a small business incubator in Cooma - there was a record attendance and it was a great initiative. Also, $24 million will be made available for referral and support services for small business. We will help with the construction of up to 12 new incubators per year.The budget also cuts the superannuation surcharge by 4½ per cent over three years and it gives small business people a tax incentive to put away more super. It also helps small businesses with tax compliance, through the provision of $45 million for GST field services. It increases export assistance and sets up the 10 TradeStart offices that the Deputy Prime Minister referred to as a great initiative a little earlier. It encourages businesses to take on apprentices, particularly in information technology. I commend the minister for education on that initiative as well. - By far the most significant benefit for small business out of last night's budget is that we are keeping the Australian economy strong. Compared with the dark days of Labor in government, today inflation is down, economic growth is up, unemployment is down, exports are up, government debt is down and business investment is up. That helps small businesses to remain and become more profitable and it helps to create more jobs for many young Australians.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member is that I have not seen those comments but, as I do with all these comments that are put to me, I will get hold of them and analyse them. I had, for example, a case quoted to me on radio this morning. It would appear, on a quick examination, that because of the age of the person involved, under the principles that I have outlined here, that person would not be affected by the review. I am not going to attempt, without doing further analysis, to give a yes or no answer. I will have the details examined and I will get Senator Vanstone, the relevant minister, to respond to you. I have indicated in broad outline the way in which the new principles are going to operate. I have to remind the honourable member that the views expressed by her colleagues cannot be ignored. I am quite certain that the views expressed by her colleagues were not directed at people who did not have a meritorious case on their side, that they were directed at people who, in their view, were abusing the system. That clearly would not be the case with people who were suffering the sorts of disabilities of which you speak, without seeking to give a definite answer one way or another about that case. We are all desirous of helping people in a situation like that, but I would hope that we are equally united in our desire to make certain that the system is not abused. The only way you can stop the abuse of the system is to reform it. That is what the member for Werriwa and the member for Lilley had in their minds when they made those statements. You can choose to play the opportunistic game that the Leader of the Opposition has played on this matter or you can choose to support an attempt by the government to get some fairness, balance and rationality into the system. I invite the opposition to constructively cooperate with the government on this issue, instead of, in the one breath, as they have always done, say that the problem has to be fixed but, when an opportunity arises to fix it, run a hundred miles from it and wrap themselves in the flag of opportunism. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and I acknowledge the interest that he has in economic policy -  good economic policy. The budget which the government brought down two days ago is directed towards keeping the Australian economy strong. In a global economic slowdown, Australia's economy has continued to create new jobs, with some 900,000 new jobs created since this government was elected in 1996. We propose to continue strong economic policy. By the end of this year, the government will have repaid $62 billion of Labor debt. That is giving young Australians a much better opportunity in life. By the end of this year, the government will have repaid $62 billion of Labor's debt.When the government announced its budget - the first budget after the election -  in normal circumstances an opposition would acknowledge the right of a government to enact its budget and to put it into place. In normal circumstances, that is what would happen. Yet we have seen the Labor Party, over the last 24 hours, after a pathetic showing in question time yesterday - one of the worst budget replies in the time that I have been here - in order get on to a new tack, decide that it would come out and try and cherry-pick the budget to try to pull apart the government's economic strategy.It took them five years of those kinds of stunts - two election losses - to come to their senses not so long ago that the public did not believe them on economic policy. We had stunts all the way through the last one. Can you remember the lettuce packages and the Hockey bear pyjamas, and how it made the Labor Party backbench feel good at the time? Do you remember where it ended? Do you remember who the opportunist was who came in with the lettuce packages, the Hockey bear pyjamas and the stuffed bears?The shadow Treasurer went to the Fabian Society on 4 May 2002 and he said that the Labor Party, after five years of opportunist politics, was going to support the government's tax policy. The shadow Treasurer of the Labor Party, on 4 May 2002, some 12 days ago, also said:There is evidence to suggest that one public perception which distinguishes Labor's success at a local level from our recent failures at the national level has been fear of a lack of discipline in our fiscal policy and concern about the implications of this for interest rates.Why would the public have a fear of a lack of discipline in the fiscal policy of the Labor Party when 12 days later, at the first hurdle, the Labor Party, which had been calling for changes to the disability support pension, says it will not vote for them? The member for Werriwa calls for changes to the disability support pension. He runs around Australia saying: `I'm economically responsible. I support coalition policy.' His main claim to fame is that he supports coalition policies. - I refer the House to this quote:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension, which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians ... Some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000 - he wanted to take 400,000 off - The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.But don't misrepresent him! Don't say that he actually called for an overhaul of the disability support pension! They are your words. At the first hurdle, the person who claims the government should be bold and adventurous is apparently going to cross the floor and vote against reform. When opportunism comes knocking, the Labor Party says, `Welcome home, dear friend.' This was the kind of strategy that Labor followed under this Leader of the Opposition for five years. On this side of the parliament, we believe that it is not just a question of talking about reform but a question of doing it. We believe that the bona fides are shown when you vote on the floor of this House, not when you run around trying to show people that you have an intention which is responsible. This is the side of the House which is going to pursue real economic policy, which is going to pursue welfare reform, which is going to make our social services defendable and affordable into the future. We did it in the past, we intend to do it in the future and we will not be diverted by the cynical cheapjack opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. - I table the transcript that I referred to earlier. - I seek leave to quote the transcript of Mark Latham, ALP member for Werriwa on 26 July 1999 and I give permission for the full speech to be tabled as well.</DOC>

 - If the member for Fowler is good enough to send me some details, and perhaps you might, in elaboration of the lady's reference to low paid jobs, to find out whether in the case in question the two people are paid award wages or not, because some people with disabilities work in circumstances where they are not paid award wages and there is a clear exemption - the member for Fowler turns away -  - I am simply trying to assist her and to assist her constituents. If she can get me some further information about the nature of their employment, I would be very happy to investigate what she has put. I have had a number of examples put to me in relation to this and quite a number of them have been found not to be in any way affected by the changes that were announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night. I saw some correspondence in one of the major daily newspapers today suggesting that somebody who was clearly working in the circumstances of a sheltered workshop was asserting - or somebody on that person's behalf was asserting - that they were affected by the government's changes; they are not, because when award wages are not paid they are clearly not affected. As I indicated to the House yesterday, there are a number of circumstances where the exemptions apply. I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition based on some remarks made by Alan Jones this morning. On the face of it, that young man is not able to work and is therefore completely unaffected. - The reality - and this is based on figures provided by Centrelink - is that the overwhelming majority of people who receive this pension do not work, and there are some exemptions in relation to people who do work. The purpose of this change, it should be understood, was to tackle and to catch areas of abuse. If we are sensible about it, we will understand -  - that there are areas of abuse. Whatever might now be said, that was recognised by the member for Werriwa and it has been recognised by the member for Lillee. - It may be uncomfortable to be reminded but the reality is that there are significant areas of abuse. This government is endeavouring to tackle some of these things because it thinks that, in the long term, unless some of these things - and this applies in relation to not only disability support but also pharmaceutical benefits - are tackled in a steady, incremental fashion now, claims on the budget will mean the schemes will break down under their collective weight, and through their collective expanding cost, in the years ahead. The price paid will be much greater and the penalties imposed on taxpayers in future years will be much greater. But, if the member for Fowler would be so good as to obtain some more information from this lady, particularly in relation to the precise nature of her children's employment, I will have some more investigations made and I will respond to her, just as I have today responded to the Chief Opposition Whip, who raised a matter with me yesterday in relation to the Smiths. I pointed out in that reply that figures provided by Centrelink indicate that only around 31,000 of the estimated 652,000 DSP recipients have employment earnings that affect their entitlement to a full pension.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I am aware of strategies to undermine the government's economic management. They can be seen as nothing other than a cynical attempt to undermine our economic strategy for short-term political gain, which, at a time like this for Australia, I would have thought was extremely unfortunate and not welcomed at all by the community. As the Treasurer has just said - the Prime Minister has just spoken about this as well - the rising costs of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and of disability support cannot be sustained into the long term. They have to be put on a sustainable basis. That process has to begin now or they will collapse and, just as a former Prime Minister - one of yours - observed a few years ago, the losers will be those in genuine need.We face a situation where it is very easy for the opposition to be opportunistic. They will not tell us what their alternatives really are. We are entitled to probe a little and, if necessary, to speculate. You can do that on the basis of a considerable amount of history. What are their savings measures, if they have them? If they propose revenue measures, where might they be? Or is it just that we ought to assume there will be a return to the way they managed the place during the Hawke and Keating years, when we saw -  and this ought never to be forgotten - continual tax increases and a raft of new taxes? We saw never ending asset sales, with the proceeds devoted to recurrent expenditure, while all the time we saw big deficits accumulating in a $96 billion public sector debt. Their budgetary form ought to be remembered.We have not heard anything about their attitude towards fuel indexation. Perhaps we will hear a bit tonight. Perhaps they really are in favour of reintroducing automatic indexation twice a year. When they were in government they went well beyond that. Petrol excise increased from less than 7c a litre to more than 34c a litre. The fringe benefits tax was increased three times. The Medicare levy was increased. Company tax was increased. Sales tax on passenger cars went from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Those are just a few reminders. But in that context of budgets not being disciplined and economic strategies not being thought out and pursued, one of the great and damaging effects was interest rates. Unemployment was over 11 per cent and home interest rates were hitting 17.5 per cent. Farmers well remember - I remember it well because it was at the time I came into this place, and shortly after that the Leader of the Opposition became the minister for agriculture, so he should have some sympathy with what those interest rates did out there - that some farmers were paying up to 25 per cent. I recall - somebody reminded me yesterday - that when we did the maths on what farmers who were forced to borrow from the pastoral houses were paying, the figure got as high as 27 per cent. So we ought to remember where we have come from.This brings me to a very important point in relation to Australia's national interest. When the Leader of the Opposition rises in about four hours from now to deliver his budget speech in reply, he must meet the obligation that pertains to a man who would be Prime Minister. He must put before the Australian people honestly and fairly how Labor would pay for their plans, how they would go about building an economic strategy, and how they would fairly implement the programs that they say matter. He has four hours to do something that his predecessor could not do, which is to come up with a believable economic strategy. He owes it to Australia. Australia at this time needs to be strong and secure. The Leader of the Opposition quite frankly now has a task: he has to prove to the Australian people that he does not want us weak and vulnerable for short-term political gain.</DOC>

 - I have read those remarks, and let me say a couple of things about them. The first is that it was an unambiguous recommendation of the McClure report - and Patrick McClure did not seek to deny it in that interview - that the current measurement in relation to hours worked, and that is 30 hours, should be reviewed in the light of -  - There has been no cut. - There has been no cut. The level of the disability support pension remains the same. It remains exactly the same. He recommended that we change the 30 hours. The reason that he gave in the summary recommendations of the report was to the effect that in the light of prevailing labour market conditions and work practices it should be changed. Could I remind the opposition that when you take into account the changes made in relation to the disability support pension and the other commitments in relation to disability services, the total amount provided for in the budget for disability services actually increases by $100 million. - The member for Lilley, who is a resident expert on everything - the resident know-all of the opposition frontbench -  - I am sorry. If he is offended by an imputation of knowledge, I withdraw. I would not want to do that. I withdraw the imputation. - One of the things that the opposition has to face up to is that if you segment out all the allocations for disability services - the additional 73,000 places and the additional moneys going to the states under the Commonwealth-state disability agreement - the resources allocated in those areas exceed by more than $100 million the consequences of the changes that have been announced in relation to the disability support pension. The member for Lilley referred to balance. What we have sought to do in this area is to rebalance support. We are concerned to ensure that people are given incentives to participate. We are concerned to ensure that people are given greater encouragement to be in the work force. - We are concerned about abuses, which have been identified by both the member for Werriwa and the member for Lilley, both of whom are unashamed identifiers of abuse of the welfare system until such time as they are required to vote for some measures to do something about it. Both of them have identified the problem. I say to both of them and to everybody else who sits opposite that this budget actually allocates $100 million more in relation to disability support, yet you are going to vote against those measures. I find that very hard to reconcile with your self-professed commitment to the disadvantaged in the community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question and for the leadership that he is providing to the aspirational classes of Western Sydney. This is a government which believes in stakeholder democracy. This is a government which wants to make share owning as much a part of the Australian way life as home owning. In its first budget, this government doubled the tax concessions for employee share ownership schemes. Thanks to the policies of this government, including privatisation policies -  which have been opposed at every point by members opposite - the percentage of Australians who now directly or indirectly own shares has risen from 37 per cent to 51 per cent.Behold: a prophet has arisen in the land! At last, a prophet has arisen in the land! The sage of Werriwa, who used to believe in the imposition of capital gains tax on the family home, now wants to encourage ownership. Last week, he released his policy to a seriously underwhelming response from his senior colleagues. The shadow Treasurer said of the policy of the member for Werriwa:... which of the individual measures ... go forward ... there's a long time before we get to the answer of that question.That is what the shadow Treasurer said. The shadow foreign minister said:There's a huge diversity of views within the party. It's unclear what will emerge at the end of this process.The attitude of his colleagues to the member for Werriwa's proposal was best encapsulated by Workers Online, the official organ of the New South Wales Labor Council, which said:Far from being Labor's new light on the hill, Latham's share ownership agenda is a dousing of the flame - a desertion of the idea of working together as a society rather than as individual players.Workers Online said:If we give up on this, we may as well all join the Liberals.Then it said:Mark could do us all a favour by leading the way.The Liberal Party is a broad church, but a Liberal Latham is a little beyond the pale! First of all, the member for Werriwa would have to do that course in anger management therapy. Secondly, he would have to put himself on a three-year good behaviour bond and promise to leave the taxi drivers of Sydney alone. Thirdly, as an act of atonement to everyone in Australia with a disability, he would have to offer a profound apology for calling a man on crutches deformed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his maiden question, his second question, his third question and his fourth question all at once. - I hope it does not take you as long to get up another question in your tactics committee! - The first thing to say is that under the Labor Party over the last six years - under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition, who was then employment minister - the number of long-term unemployed in this country grew and grew. In fact, long-term unemployment grew by 89 per cent over that time. Labor threw people onto the scrap heap and kept them there, while spending $3,000 million of taxpayers' money. It cost the taxpayer $15,000 for every person who got a job. Today, it costs $5,000. The number of very long-term unemployed - of whom there were a multitude under the Labor Party - in the last six years of Labor increased by 90.1 per cent. - In conclusion on that point: since the election of the Howard government, very long-term unemployment has come down by 13 per cent and today is less than half the rate it was under the peak of the Labor government. To come to question 3 or question 4 of your four questions, you asked about what we will do about limiting the services in the Job Network. What the member for Kingston obviously did not see when he was in the lockup is that this is an uncapped program. Whether you are a disability support pensioner coming off DSP into new work or into the unemployment field and into the Job Network, you will be accommodated. I inform the House that everybody will have access to the new scheme of intensive support customised assistance -  everybody!The member for Kingston also makes the claim that there will be less money. In this current year, we will spend in the order of $823 million. We will be spending over $900 million in the out years. There will be more money spent on the Job Network. There will be better services that are better targeted. We will get results. The Job Network, since its inception, has continued to outperform its predecessor. The question for the opposition is this: are you going to put up a policy that damns the Job Network, or will you be in the vacuous position that you have always been in - saying nothing, doing nothing but barking an awful lot?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. He has a particular interest in this subject, as the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services. As the Treasurer pointed out on budget night, the terrorist attacks on the United States last year marked a fundamental shift in the international security environment. We can no longer sit back and assume that we are safe from such devastating events. Australia needs to protect itself from the inexplicable and horrifying violence of terrorists. It is not good enough to say, `We will take a chance with our families, our friends and our neighbours.' - It is not good enough to say, `No, we won't do anything until we see the whites of terrorists' eyes.' The September 11 attacks on the United States were not expected. Terrorists are not going to ring ahead and inform us that their sights have turned to Australia. It would be irresponsible of the government not to do everything within its power to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, and we must make sure that we are in the best possible position to identify, prevent and punish those responsible for terrorist acts and those planning terrorist acts. The government is committed to doing just that. I note that this commitment has been recognised and welcomed by our coalition partners in the war against terrorism. I recently returned from discussions with my counterparts in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and I can report to the House that our commitment to dealing with the threat of terrorism in a comprehensive and responsible way has earned us the appreciation and respect of these important allies and, in particular, the respect of the United States. In the budget, the government committed an extra $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security in Australia.  - In my portfolio, in particular, an additional $126.6 million has been earmarked specifically to bolster our counter-terrorism abilities. This new spending includes $110.1 million to enhance Australian Federal Police protective security services; $14.4 million for better coordination of Australia's counter-terrorism arrangements in line with the decisions of the leaders summit on terrorism and multijurisdictional crime; $17.8 million to provide specialised equipment and training for emergency services; and $16.2 million to protect the security of Australia's national information infrastructure. There is more yet: $128.5 million to enhance aviation security; $49 million to enhance the technical investigation capabilities of the AFP, the NCA and ASIO; $48.3 million to strengthen ASIO's intelligence capability and coordination; and $42.3 million to increase the ability of the Australian Customs Service -  - to screen air passengers for possible terrorist situations and other border security threats. This budget is compelling evidence of the government's determination -  - to make the hard decisions to ensure that Australia remains safe and secure.  - I call on the opposition to make it clear to the Australian community that it supports the government in these matters.</DOC>

 - I will have a look at that statement, but I will be charitable to the member for Perth and accept provisionally -  always a wise caveat to put on accepting anything from the opposition - that he has accurately quoted what the minister said. I notice that he quotes the minister as saying that it is rising by 13 per cent. That is broadly correct: over the last 10 years it has risen at an average rate of 13.8 per cent. If you have a look at the Intergenerational Report, which of course would not have been available to the good doctor when he made those remarks -  -  - That Intergenerational Report was not available to the former health minister. - Would you send him a copy? - Send it to - I can call him Michael in this House now, can't I, Mr Speaker? He is no longer a member of this place. Would you like to send him a copy of that report? That report makes very revealing reading. What it indicates is that the cost of maintaining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is going to rise at an ever increasing rate over the years ahead.It is indisputable that, if we do not now begin the process of doing something about that, we are going to approach a real crisis in its funding and its management in the not too distant future. We face a choice. We can start that process now in a sensible fashion. I am aided in that argument by a list that I have been provided, which has been compiled by the indefatigable member for Boothby, who takes a very great interest in these matters. It lists the 10 highest costing PBS drugs by generic name for the year ended 31 December. I will start with the first one, which is Simvastatin; the total cost in relation to that drug is $282 million. This goes to the very heart of this argument. The total cost of this first drug on the list is $282 million, of which the general body of taxpayers is now funding $251 million. The next `statin', which is the second most frequently used, has a total cost of $292 million, of which the taxpaying public - the people who may be watching question time, the people in the gallery - are already funding $250 million. The next drug on the list, which deals with peptic ulcers, totals $185 million, of which the taxpayer is providing $162 million. - Those opposite can have their silly interjections about this. - Those opposite can play a silly political game about this but, in the end, we face a choice: do we allow a scheme to go on growing exponentially in cost, funded all the while by the general body of taxpayers? To anybody listening to this debate who imagines that, if the opposition is successful in defeating this measure, they will be relieved of the future cost burden of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, can I say they are completely wrong because, in the end, they will get a bigger slug. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects with feigned incredulity. In the end, the reason it will cost the Australian taxpayer more unless the sort of preventative measures that we are advocating now are adopted is that, unless you get some additional price signals, unless you get some additional discipline into this - and this has been widely recognised by anybody who has examined this - it is simply going to break down under its own weight.The evidence is there for all to see. The cheap political opportunism of the opposition on this issue does them no credit, and I believe the Australian community will see through it. In the end, they know that you cannot get something like this for nothing. Either you get some sensible discipline into it now or you face a real funding crisis some time down the track. If the system collapses, those who will suffer most will be the sick and vulnerable, and the people who will carry the most blame for those people suffering will be those in the Australian Labor Party who have brought these measures undone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his very strong advocacy on behalf of all students and schools in his electorate, and Springwood High School in particular. This year the government has increased its funding to schools by 6½ per cent, which takes the amount that the Commonwealth will spend on Australian schools this coming financial year to $6.6 billion. That means that, since its election, this government has increased its funding to Australian schools by 80 per cent. The funding this year to government schools increases by 5.7 per cent. That represents a 52 per cent increase in funding to government schools from the Commonwealth government in the six years it has been office. That 52 per cent increase in funding to government schools -  - has occurred during a period in which enrolments -  - That 52 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding to government schools has occurred during a period in which enrolments in government schools have increased by 1.4 per cent. Further to that, the Commonwealth government, which has primary responsibility for supporting parents who choose to send their children to non-government schools, has increased its funding to non-government schools by 9.2 per cent. That means that the rate of funding increase by the Commonwealth government to government schools is 407 per cent the rate of increase in enrolments in the government school sector. It also means that the rate of increase in funding to non-government schools is 60 per cent the rate of increase of enrolments in the non-government sector, because this year the enrolments in the non-government sector are forecast to grow at around 15 per cent.It is important that Australians understand that, of the 3.2 million students in Australian schools, 2.2 million attend government schools and one million attend non-government schools. That means that the 69 per cent of students in government schools receive 78 per cent of all the public money that goes into government schools, and the 31 per cent of students in non-government schools, the one million, receive 22 per cent - of course, parents contribute some $3 billion.I was asked about state government funding for state schools. They are called state schools because they are run, principally funded and owned by state governments. State governments provide around 84 per cent of the funding that goes to their state government schools. The Commonwealth government meets a responsibility to supplement the funding to government schools and provides around 12 per cent of the funding to government schools, the rest being made up by parents. The New South Wales education minister, John Watkins, was asked on Sydney radio 2UE yesterday about education funding in New South Wales, and this is what he said:The state government provides a huge amount of money for public education, as it should, and we will continue to increase that.This is very good news: we now have a state minister who is apparently finally prepared to shoulder his share of this important burden. In this budget, the Howard government has increased its funding to New South Wales government schools by 5.7 per cent. There is a 5.7 per cent increase in funding to government schools. In the last budget, the New South Wales government increased its funding by 2.5 per cent. That means that, if the New South Wales government had increased the funding to its government schools by the same amount as the Commonwealth increased its funding to the New South Wales government schools, there would have been another $173 million to support the funding of students in New South Wales government schools. I say to Mr Watkins, and particularly to Mr Carr, `Where is the other $103 million?'The member for Aston last night was asking me how the Victorian government shapes up in this regard. Recently the Victorian government had a budget, and it made a big fuss about putting more money into education. You might be interested to know that the Howard government this year has increased funding to Victorian government schools by 5.3 per cent. In contrast, the Victorian government has increased the funding to its own government schools by 2.9 per cent. That means that $95 million has disappeared from Victorian government schools in contrast to the increase from the Commonwealth government. The final point that should be made -  - I need to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he agrees with Senator Kim Carr, who has described government support for parents to send their children to non-government schools as `middle-class welfare'. We should not forget, given that the member for Macquarie has raised this important issue, Greg and Gina Fletcher of the Bird In Hand Inn in the electorate of Macquarie. Greg Fletcher, who is a factory worker, said he was not happy about the Labor Party's pledge to take money away from private schools. He said:People around here don't have much money, but they save and save so that they can send their kids to a private school and get a good education and then Labor says you shouldn't try to do this.They are still saying that.</DOC>

 - The shadow Treasurer embarrassed himself yesterday by referring to the accrual outcome in the 2001-02 year -  - I will tell you why he embarrassed himself: because he claimed that the accrual deficit had worsened since the midyear review when in fact the accrual position had improved since the midyear review. So, if you want to actually work off the accrual figures, in fact it had picked up between the midyear review and the budget - a point that you embarrassed yourself on yesterday, but that is fair enough. Again, if your point is that an accrual deficit of $3 billion would be having a current effect on interest rates, my point is that it has actually improved. It improved, so the fundamental premise of your question cannot be right. It cannot be right! - No, don't try to change the question now! Don't try to have a new one from the front bench - we will deal with the one that you actually asked. It is only the second question that you have asked since the budget came down. So, if the premise was that somehow a worsening accrual result was having an effect on interest rates, my answer is: actually the accrual balance improved. So, by your logic, it should actually have a positive effect in relation to monetary policy. I think I am entitled to point that out. But we will take the other point of your question, which lies behind it, which is this: apparently you believe it is important to have strong fiscal policy to keep interest rates low. That is the other assumption. If that were the case, you would be -  would you not? - voting for the government's measures to save expenditure. We have now heard five questions of `Why doesn't the government spend more?', followed by a question of `Why don't you have a larger surplus?' Why didn't we think of this - spending more and producing a bigger surplus! We had five years of this, remember. You were against every expense saving, you were against exemption measures, you were in favour of budget surpluses -  - and you went down to the Fabian Society -  - which Bob was remembering operates as a wolf in sheep's clothing. He went down to the Fabian Society and said, `The public did not trust us on economic policy.' Is it a wonder that the public does not trust them on economic policy! I think the public have figured the Labor Party out - they figured them out over five years, and we hope they will figure it out over another three.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby who, by not only his actions but also by his results -  -  - has demonstrated what an excellent advocate he is -  - What an excellent member the member for Boothby is in support of industry and jobs in his electorate. - The budget contained funding for a number of job and nation building projects in Australia, and constituents of the member for Boothby certainly welcomed the acceptance by Mitsubishi of the $35 million investment incentive to secure Mitsubishi's new R&amp;D centre in Adelaide. That investment represents only part of the $700 million investment by Mitsubishi and supports some 4,000 jobs, both new and old. Mitsubishi estimates, in fact, that there will be 1,300 additional employees to be taken on as a result of this latest investment. The investment by Mitsubishi and the government also provides added security to the component and other service suppliers.On top of the investment in Mitsubishi, the budget also confirmed an investment of some $125 million in support of Rio Tinto and its development of HIsmelt technology in Kwinana in Western Australia. Not only will that obviously provide jobs in the development of that facility - a $1.2 billion investment by Rio Tinto - but it also offers the opportunity for that technology to be proliferated around the world, bringing Australia both royalties and, of course, extra sales for iron ore and coal. As well, there is the $1 billion synthesis gas and methanol plant development on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia. I am sure that is welcomed by its hairless member! In terms of that development, the federal government contributed a further $85 million. One thousand people will be employed in the construction of that project and 150 permanent full-time jobs will come as a result of it. In the words of Access Economics senior economist, David Rumbens:Boom times appear to be on the way for business investment in Australia.I could not agree more. The government, in its budget measures - I see the member for Hunter has rejoined us; he will be interested in some of these points, which he missed on budget night - put $44 million into Invest Australia, $8.5 million into Geoscience to continue the research and development program for oil exploration, some $6.1 million into a national offshore safety authority and, as the member for Hunter quite rightly called for, a new depreciation regime for the Australian petroleum industry, which, as the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association said yesterday:... opened the door for a multimillion-dollar increase in domestic energy projects.The Howard government has provided a stable and secure environment through responsible and strong economic management, with low interest rates, low inflation and solid growth. Are there any alternative policies? I am not aware of them. I know that in November last year the member for Rankin said:I am looking forward to a genuine contest on ideas and policies.Well, I am still waiting.</DOC>

 - If my memory serves me correctly, I may have said something closely resembling that. - Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that if I had not said something like that after the 1993 election, I should have. Let me take the Leader of the Opposition down memory lane on this subject. Let me take him back to the circumstances of the 1993 election. We remember the 1993 election. For the benefit of some of the newer members of this House - I know that they were actively following political affairs at that time - the 1993 election was fought on the issue of reform of the Australian taxation system. Despite the then Prime Minister and former Treasurer, Mr Keating, having been a champion - with my support, I might say, from opposition at the time, in the 1980s - and I might remind the House while we are talking about opportunism -  -  - I have to say that I did not realise that the Leader of the Opposition would be so generous at question time. - I might remind the House that, at the tax summit in the 1980s, the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, had no stronger supporter in relation to some of his proposals for tax reform than his then opposite number in the opposition. But in 1993, that election was fought overwhelmingly on the issue of taxation reform. Every campaign utterance, every scare tactic, every misrepresentation of the Labor Party in that election campaign was about how villainous, unconscionable, wicked and absolutely morally bankrupt it would be of any government to introduce a broad based indirect tax. They ran around the country saying that it should never be introduced, yet, without so much as the tiniest warning during the election campaign, when the Keating government was re-elected, within a few months they systematically dismantled -  - just about every single election commitment they had made. They dishonoured commitments they had made to pensioners and they increased, without any warning, the rates of indirect tax on petrol, on cigarettes and on alcohol. That is why we voted against those measures. There is absolutely no resemblance of any description between these circumstances and the circumstances that obtained there. I do not remember, during this last election campaign, the Treasurer or myself going around to the Australian people talking about l-a-w law tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is a cheapjack opportunist, and he belonged to a government that completely dishonoured the mandate it received in 1993. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question and I acknowledge her great support for the government's magnificent rescue plan for the Murray Darling Basin. This is the greenest budget ever delivered, by the greenest government in Australian history. No government has done more to invest in putting the Australian environment on a sustainable basis. This is reflected in the fact that, in the next year, the government will be investing a record $1.8 billion in the environment, an increase of almost $200 million over the previous year. - This is a budget which delivers in full on the government's election commitments to pour another $1 billion into the Natural Heritage Trust, and the Commonwealth share of the $1.4 billion National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. I am asked if I am aware of any alternative policies. I am aware of comment on this extraordinary environmental budget by the shadow minister for the environment, who should probably be known as the shadow minister for mistakes, because he would have to be holding the record for the most incompetent series of press releases that we have ever seen. He is a former shadow assistant Treasurer and yet it appears he cannot even read the budget papers. In his press release yesterday, snuck out during question time so that it would not get examined yesterday, he said that funding for biodiversity had been cut by $67 million in the budget. In fact it has been increased by $25 million. He said that funding for national parks had been cut. In fact it has been increased by $7 million. He said that funding for the Greenhouse Office had been cut, when in fact its expenditure will increase from $95 million in the current year to $113 million next year - a 20 per cent increase.You have to ask the question: did he get these figures wrong on purpose or was it just sheer incompetence and stupidity? He complains that the national action plan has been delayed, but who delayed the expenditure on the national action plan? It was the Labor Party governments in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia which refused to sign up to the national action plan and put politics ahead of the environment before the federal election. It is only since the federal election that they have come good and actually started to cooperate in addressing these serious problems of salinity.This budget is one that puts in place the strongest environmental programs ever, to put Australia on a sustainable basis. We will be spending over $103 million next year on the vital work of ensuring the sustainable use of our waterways, coasts and oceans and the protection of areas of high conservation value, including the national coastal policy which we announced during the election campaign. We will be devoting $55 million to improving air quality in our cities and towns to encourage a better environmental performance from industry and further combat pollution from motor vehicles. We will be devoting $31 million to put the Great Barrier Reef on a sustainable basis.This budget delivers a record commitment by the Howard government. In fact, spending in the coming year will be 2½ times the level of spending on targeted environmental programs of the Labor Party in 1995-96. This budget once again confirms the government's historic commitment to placing Australia on a sustainable basis and to restoring an environment which is not just a national treasure but a global one.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In addition to hiring a new statistician, an analyst of budget figures, he might care to get his hearing checked. The reason why the expenditure -  - on the national action plan was delayed was that your mates in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia chose to play shabby politics with the Australian environment. They refused to sign the bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth which they know are necessary to allow the funds to flow. - They were prepared to continue to see salinity destroying our agricultural land. They were prepared to see the Murray-Darling Basin continue to be polluted without taking any action and taking advantage of the very generous offer of the Commonwealth to put some $700 million -  - into an action plan to restore the quality of water and to address salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is quite clear that this shadow minister has no grasp of these issues. If the Victorian government is serious about the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline and not just making further rhetorical claims, it only has to do one very simple thing: it has to give it priority in its funding under the national action plan and the Natural Heritage Trust and it will be able to get money flowing into Victoria for that priority project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I am confident that the member for Dobell's margin would be greater if the electoral roll were truly fraud proof in this country. The integrity of the electoral roll is essential in any healthy democracy, but we know that the Australian electoral roll at present is far from fraud proof. We know because the Shepherdson inquiry last year gave numerous examples of senior Queensland Labor Party figures who had been frauding the electoral roll. We know because the Deputy Premier of Queensland resigned because he had frauded the electoral roll. We know that right now it is easier to go on the electoral roll than it is to sign up to the local video store.To try to bring about a better situation, this government last year tabled regulations in the Senate providing that new enrollees had to provide one piece of documentary ID -  that is all - and have their applications signed by one other person. What could be more reasonable, what could be fairer, than that? The friends of democracy in Australia need to know that the Labor Party has ratted on them, because yesterday in the Senate the Labor Party successfully moved a disallowance motion to knock out the government's perfectly reasonable, fair and simple changes.This was a day of infamy for Australian democracy, and the Australian people need to understand that last year's party of rorters is this year's party of protectors of rorters. They need to understand that the Leader of the Opposition wants it to be easy to rort the electoral roll. They need to understand that the Labor Party is soft on rorts and soft on the causes of rorts.</DOC>

My colleague will be tabling the two departmental reports which I have received and which, quite appropriately, I decided to have tabled at the time of the Auditor-General's report. I also draw the attention of the member for Perth to the fact that, when I became aware of this matter, I indicated some unhappiness with the fact that the decision had been taken. - I made it very clear then that the thing should be cancelled. It has been. The money has been fully reinstated. - Nobody has been caught out. If that is the best the shadow minister can do -  - she is struggling rather hard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. I know that he values and supports the veterans in his community, especially the veterans at the Kenmore-Moggill RSL and the Sherwood RSL sub-branches. I am grateful for the opportunity to explain and highlight the benefits and good news of the budget and how it provides for our veterans and our war widows. The seventh Howard government budget provides record funding of $9.2 billion for the veterans' affairs portfolio.  -  - Yes, that is $9.2 billion - a record amount. It is up, in our veterans' affairs portfolio, from $8.9 billion last year. Since coming to government in 1996, the coalition has increased funding for the care, support and commemoration of our veterans and war widows by over 40 per cent. That is up from $6.2 billion to $9.2 billion. That is real care and commitment. Many members would appreciate that the vast proportion of veterans are approaching their elderly years and their health needs are becoming most pressing. In response, the Treasurer has announced in the budget the extension of comprehensive free health care through the gold card to all Australian Defence Force veterans over the age of 70 with qualifying service. This is full, comprehensive, free health care for life. As of 1 July, this is good news for 4,000 veterans who will immediately become eligible for the gold card. This will be the first time some of those veterans have received government benefits in recognition of their war service. These are veterans from the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Far East Strategic Reserve, the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War.Importantly, this initiative takes a caring, long-term view, providing to these veterans, as they reach the age of 70, automatic access to the gold card for service in the Gulf War, in East Timor and in the international coalition war against terrorism. This measure will ensure that these veterans, when they reach their 70th birthday, will have the security of knowing that they have access for the rest of their lives to comprehensive health care when they most need it.This is also good news for our war widows. This shows great respect to our war widows because this government has addressed the injustice that was bestowed on our war widows by the former Labor government. In 1986, they froze the income support supplement. The income support supplement provides financial assistance for our war widows who need it most when they have limited means to support themselves. In 2002, the budget removed the Labor freeze -  - This is an opportunity to explain a very important budget measure. In September 2002, our budget will remove the Labor Party freeze. This will enable the future indexation of our income support supplement by the same measures as our service pensions. This initiative will provide an additional benefit of $84.7 million over four years to Australia's war widows. Like the previous Howard government budget measure which restored war widows' pensions to those who had remarried before 1984, this initiative will end a longstanding iniquity against our war widows. Also, this government is committed to providing long-term fair compensation and health care to our veterans and war widows. Once again, the coalition has extended entitlements to these special Australians. We will continue to address the anomalies and the cold-hearted indifference of the Labor Party. This is a good news budget, this is a caring budget, and it pays respect to our veterans and war widows. It was promised by the Howard coalition government and it has delivered in spades.</DOC>

I rang him and said that I understood that he felt that the program was extraordinarily important -  -  - As I indicated, I am aware of those very strong comments from the aforesaid gentleman and, accordingly, I rang him and I assured him that I understood that he was very concerned to see Roads to Recovery continue, as it will. It will be delivered - a $1.2 billion package over four years. I felt it necessary to remind some people in local government that this is a very worthwhile program and that, whilst they have had to adjust to a modest rephasing of our program, as some people in this place would have liked to have seen a change of government last November, they would have been adjusting to the total abolition of the program.</DOC>

 - There are a lot of questions rolled into one, so let me focus in particular on the question that the honourable member asks about the prospect of nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. Obviously, our assessment is that it is possible, because both India and Pakistan are nuclear capable states. That is one of the reasons why the level of tension now between Pakistan and India is a matter of such very great concern not just to Australia but to the whole of the international community. In terms of the number of Australians involved, I understand that there are about 1,000 Australians living permanently in India. I cannot give the honourable member a precise answer as to the number who might be visiting the region at any particular time, but our expectation is that the number would be quite high. Obviously, the high commissions in both Islamabad and New Delhi do what they can to get in touch with Australian citizens and to ensure that those Australian citizens are aware of our consular advice.Importantly, the consular advice is on the web site, so it is available for people who have access to Internet facilities, and we do everything we can to ensure that people do know what our consular advice is. For example, within Australia over the last 24 hours I have taken the opportunity to do a number of media interviews to highlight what our consular advice is, to warn those people who are on the threshold of making a visit to either India or Pakistan that it is the government's considered view on the basis of advice we have received from our high commissions in New Delhi and Islamabad that Australians should defer both holiday and business travel to India and Pakistan, that Australians in Pakistan should consider leaving, and that Australians in India who feel that there is danger should also consider leaving.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. Many members of this House respect his knowledge and understanding of foreign affairs, particularly based on his experience working for the foreign minister - and a mighty fine job he did then. I have already explained in answer to the earlier question that the government is gravely concerned about the situation in South Asia. I have made the point, in particular, about our concerns based on the nuclear capabilities that both India and Pakistan have. It is important to remember also that the oral conflict that is taking place and the tensions as well as the possibility of real military conflict detract very seriously from the war against terrorism. I have taken the opportunity already to explain that we have upgraded our travel advice. We are also in the process of making a series of representations to both India and Pakistan about our concerns in relation to the level of tension.Whilst we can understand the anger that India feels as a result of the recent terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, Australia utterly condemns those acts. We urge India to continue to exercise the restraint that it has shown up until now. Can I take the opportunity, in answer to the honourable member's statement, to welcome President Musharraf's statement last night in which he reconfirmed his commitment that Pakistan territory would not be used to launch terrorist attacks against India or Indian interests. However, we urge Pakistan to continue to be vigilant in dealing with terrorist activities within Pakistan that may be focused on attacks against Indian assets or Indian individuals. Pakistan should not only do more, but should be seen to be doing more.Australia has been active over the last month or so on this issue, as indeed we were before then. I was in India just a month ago and I had the opportunity to discuss our concerns about this issue with the Prime Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, the Defence Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs. During last week, I instructed the acting secretary of my department to call in the Indian and Pakistani high commissioners and explain to them our concerns about the situation.Last night I spoke on the telephone to the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Abdul Sattar, and during that conversation he assured me that Pakistan would be doing what it could to try to crack down on terrorists and that Pakistan would be doing more in the next few days. Of course, the President's speech was made subsequent to that. In the course of this evening I will be speaking with my Indian counterpart and next week Australian officials will be visiting New Delhi for talks on security issues, including the question of the relationship between India and Pakistan. I think the government are proving to be extremely active on this issue. We are working very closely with the Americans, the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom and others in ensuring that a maximum international effort is made on the basis that that effort should be effective.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for his question. It was not a little unexpected. The GIO in New South Wales was formed in 1927 when the private sector in New South Wales failed to take up the opportunity to establish workers compensation insurance. When there was a market failure in that case, the state government set up an insurance office and went in to address the market failure. That is the role of state governments. When the GIO was privatised, as it was privatised by state Labor governments - the SIO, the TIO in Tasmania, the SGIO in various other jurisdictions; when they were all privatised - that was because, in 1991-92, the insurance market in Australia was a sophisticated market that provided a large number of products and covered many areas. It is fair to say, and I think it is generally accepted by all, that over the last 12 months, and particularly after the events of September 11, there has been market failure in relation to public liability. There is no doubt about that. On this side of the House, the government has a very strong view that there needs to be a reaction and the states have moved in some cases. Given that the member for Werriwa has said that the states should not be in the business of providing insurance coverage, I am pleased to advise the House that today the state minister for finance in Victoria has announced that the Victorian government will be establishing a government insurance office. He said:We are announcing today with the Municipal Association of Victoria a public liability insurance scheme that will cover up to 12,000 not-for-profit community groups that are currently having difficulty getting insurance.The fundamental point is that the state governments are responsible for insurance. It does not take a genius to work it out: the state governments are responsible for insurance because, when you look at the number of acts that state governments have specifically pertaining to insurance, there are 113 pieces of legislation by the state governments relating to insurance. They cover New South Wales, 34 acts; South Australia, seven; Victoria, 23; and so on. I am happy to table that.The second point is this: the state governments are milking insurance through the taxation they collect. Some states, like Victoria, have the highest level of taxation of insurance of anywhere in the world. Every small business, every tourism operator and every community group is paying up to 40c in the dollar in tax to the state governments. Now the state governments have to react. The state governments have to alleviate the immediate concerns of the small business community, the tourism operators and the community groups who are overwhelmingly concerned not just about the price levels of insurance but about the fact that they cannot obtain it. It is about time for the states to act. They have been working on the short-, medium- and long-term solutions for too long. At the moment there are community groups out there in need of immediate coverage. I am glad Victoria has moved today. I am also glad about the fact that a number of other state schemes are being developed by the states so that they can get back into the business of insurance when it is necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. He exhibits, as do members on both sides of the House, an ongoing interest in the war against drugs in this country. I am pleased to say to the House that the results of a survey released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on 23 May regarding drug usage and drug behaviour during the year 2001 show a number of extremely promising signs emerging in relation to drug behaviour and patterns of drug use in the three-year period from 1998 to 2001.The report found that overall there had been a 23 per cent drop in the proportion of people using illicit drugs at some time during the previous year. There was an even greater fall in drug use among teenagers aged 14 to 19. Here illicit drug use fell by 24 per cent amongst young men and 28 per cent amongst young women. Between 1998 and 2001, the proportion of people using marijuana fell from 17.9 per cent to 12.9 per cent and the proportion using heroin fell from 0.8 per cent to 0.2 per cent. To anticipate the suggestion that the fall in drug use is merely the result of the so-called heroin drought, the report also found that drug use fell in almost every category of illicit drug, just as the acceptability of drug use fell in almost every category of illicit drugs also.This report has come at a time when in other areas there are some encouraging statistics and results. When we compare the three financial years since the inception of the government's Tough on Drugs campaign with a similar period beforehand, heroin seizures have risen from 470 kilograms to 1,280 kilograms, cocaine seizures have risen from 230 kilograms to 1,560 kilograms and ecstasy seizures have risen from 135 kilograms to 660 kilograms. Opiate overdose deaths amongst 15- to 44-year-olds fell from 958 in 1999 to 725 in 2000, a fall of 24 per cent. The early results for last year are even more encouraging: in Victoria, for example, heroin deaths fell from 331 in the year 2000 to 49 in the year 2001.In the year 2000-01 there were 30,000 treatments provided to drug users by our 133 Tough on Drugs funded treatment services. That is up from about 19,000 in the previous year. Very importantly, in response to our parents education campaign last year, a survey carried out I think by the ABS found that 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children about drugs during the campaign and at the end of the campaign some 71 per cent of 15- to 17-year-olds indicated that advice from parents had had a beneficial impact in relation to their attitude towards drugs.None of these figures are used and none of these remarks are made in any way complacently. I do not pretend for a moment that all of the improvement has been due to the Tough on Drugs strategy. I do not pretend for a moment that the Tough on Drugs strategy is the only way in which this problem can be tackled. But I do think in this House, where there is a bipartisan concern about drug abuse - nobody on this side of the House has a monopoly on concern about drug abuse; everybody in different ways knows of or has been touched by the tragedy inflicted upon people by drug abuse - all of us have an interest in doing what we can according to our own beliefs to try and stamp it out. But I think there are some encouraging signs that progress is being made.I would hope that these particular statistics - that have not been compiled by the Liberal Party; they have not been compiled by a partisan source; they have been compiled by an independent Institute of Health and Welfare, whose statistics on health issues are used by both sides of the House in support of arguments - will be given much greater currency and much greater publicity than they have so far received. I think they are encouraging. They do give heart to parents who are worried sick about the threat of drugs in relation to their children, and they give some heart and some encouragement to the thousands of people who are working at the sharp end of this unending war against drug abuse.We have a war against terrorism, and that is a war that is justly fought and justly prosecuted. I also believe we have a war against the scourge of illicit drugs in our community, and I want to see that prosecuted with the same zeal, the same bipartisan resolve and the same endeavour that we give to other things, because the goals are as important. The threat of illicit drugs to the young in this community is lethal, and we have to do all we can as a nation and as a parliament to fight it. </DOC>

 - I will have a look at the claims in relation to the two members but, as has been observed here many times, you do not want to take for granted the opposition's interpretation of what might have been said by others. I would like to make a few comments. One is a very important one. It is the observation that telecommunications in rural and regional Australia are improving, which is something that we have always said is very important, not just socially but economically as well. The Leader of the Opposition has been saying that he knows all about telecommunications in regional areas and that they are not up to scratch. I am not quite certain that I can recall him actually doing a trip out there and having a look at telecommunications, but if he did he might be interested in the list of what we have done. I will just take a few moments to work through some of the things that, as a result of our efforts, are being rolled out. -  - You can tell all about their interest in regional telecommunications! - That is right. The universal service obligation now includes access to a 64-kilobit Internet connection for all Australians. The customer service guarantee has been put in place. It did not exist under Labor. They had a universal service obligation that was so basic and inadequate that you can only assume that, in their desire for a fully publicly owned Telstra, they would go back to the old universal service obligation which, quite apart from anything else, imposed no time limits whatsoever on the delivery of a telephone. There was no customer service guarantee and no effective USO. But now it is in place, it is being progressively tightened, and it is working. Another example is the CDMA mobile network. - What was the CDMA network rolled out to replace? Labor's analog system. They entered into a contract to abolish a very good service, and we had to find a replacement. They would have left country Australia with no service. People in the remotest parts of Australia now have untimed local calls. They have wanted that for decades. Who delivered it? We delivered it. By July this year, 250 rural and regional exchanges will have a high-speed broadband capacity. Next month, Telstra will begin a new iridium satellite service across Australia, backed by a Commonwealth subsidy on the cost of handsets, providing satellite communications at about half the previous cost. Also about to be released - this is a first in technological terms in Australia; we have done it ahead of the world rest of the world, as I understand it - is a long-range cordless phone. It gives coverage up to 10 kilometres from an existing phone connection. That will be a real boon for the farming community. I think it is very important that we outline these things - I really do. We have a commitment to improving rural and regional services. - To that, it needs to be added that we instituted an inquiry into the standards of services in rural and regional Australia, headed up by Tim Besley, an eminent Australian, who did a quality job and proved the lie to the ALP claim that he would just do a whitewash. He did not. We responded with $167 million worth of initiatives. We have consistently said that, unless those objectives have been met, no further progression will be made on the issue of the Telstra sale. That has been our position. I have clearly indicated - because it is important - that we are committed to improving services. They are improving. All of those commentators who focus only on the economic aspects of selling Telstra need to recognise something else: having world-class technological capacity in telecommunications in rural and regional Australia is vitally important in economic terms as well because of the wealth, the jobs that are generated and the need for it to have first-class technologies at reliable capacities and at economical rates.Our position on this is very clear. I believe that it is the right position. Again, I would just make the point that the ALP have put up a list of options on how they would break up Telstra and put it back together again. But there is a glaring omission in that policy position. There is nothing in it; there is no commitment at all to ensuring that rural and regional Australia has the telecommunications it needs. It is just not there.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest in sustainable health care services. When we released the Intergenerational Report, it showed that there was no area of government expenditure growing at a faster rate than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It showed that the pressure of medical science, the ability to bring new medicines with treatment at a high cost onto the scheme, is going to be a significant driver of cost into the future. Any person that is interested in sustaining affordable pharmaceutical benefits will be interested in getting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme onto a sustainable basis. That is why we announced in the budget measures to promote generic pharmaceuticals, measures to cut down on fraud, measures to enforce prescribing restrictions and so on.We also announced increases in the copayments for pensioners - an increase of $1, from $3.60 to $4.60. Bear in mind that, after 52 scripts in a particular year, they are free thereafter for pensioners and concession holders. We announced for non-concession holders that the maximum rate for any pharmaceutical would be increased by $6.20, up to $28.60. That is the ceiling rate; that is the maximum that people can pay. So, if the pharmaceutical is $100, $200, $1,000 or $2,000, the maximum payable is $28.60. But this does not mean that each and every prescription is going up by $6.20, and there has been persistent misreporting of this fact arising out of the budget. For example, in the Age on 18 May 2002, the reaction of a family was as follows:We've got a son who's an asthmatic. We were paying $17 to $18 a script before, now it's going to be in the $25 to $27 mark. That is not right. If it was $17 to $18 a script before, it will be $17 to $18 afterwards. Another example is Ventolin: a Ventolin CFC-free inhaler with 200 doses costs $17.20. After the changes, it will cost $17.20. It is only the maximum that is going up. If you were below the maximum, the price does not change. This is something that has been persistently misrepresented by the Labor Party, which has been claiming that all prescriptions are going up. There was a piece in the Australian on 23 May 2002 where the member for Lalor said: ... the Howard Government's policies on the fertility rate seem confined to making the pill more expensive as a result of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes.That is not the truth. - Why would you be retailing that through the Australian if it is not the truth? Let us take some of the oral contraceptives: Trifeme, an oral contraceptive, is $15.02 before the changes; it is $15.02 after the changes. Nordette is $15.91 before the changes and it is $15.91 after the changes. Levlen, another oral contraceptive, is $15.91 before the changes and it is $15.91 after the changes. The Labor Party announced that it was going to vote against putting every script up by $6.20, without finding out that every script is actually not going up by $6.20. Talk about cheapjack opportunism. Mostly you find out the facts before you announce a position.Let us take the antibiotic Augmentin: it is $18.19 before the changes and it is $18.19 after the changes. Let us take Normison, sleeping tablets. - There is no need for them while you are the Leader of the Opposition. That is why we put you on at 11 o'clock at night, with your newly acquired deep voice. With Normison, for 25 tablets it costs $7.58 before the changes and it costs $7.58 after the changes. Sleeping pills, antibiotics, the contraceptive pill and Ventolin -  the Labor Party has consistently tried to mislead the Australian public in relation to this, going into the newspapers claiming that everything is going up by $6.20. The Australian people ought to see through the Labor Party for the misrepresentation and deceit which it has practised in relation to this matter.If you want a defensible, sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, you need to put it on a substantial and sustainable financial basis. The people that tell you that no changes are required are the people that are essentially trying to sell the Australian public a lie. If we do not make small changes now to keep this financially sustainable, the only changes which you will have to make in the years to come are much more drastic ones. You will not be able to bring increasingly sophisticated pharmaceuticals onto the scheme, at very high costs, unless you have the scheme on a sustainable basis. The reason why this side of the House wants to put pharmaceuticals on a sustainable basis is that we care enough about people's access to pharmaceuticals to make them affordable in the long term. If you want to make them affordable in the long term, you will be putting in place now the reform which will keep this system going. This is the side of the House that believes in a sustainable system. Cheapjack opportunism will not deliver sustainable pharmaceutical benefits and nor will misleading the Australian public.</DOC>

 - Senator Boswell observed on the weekend, as indeed I have repeated here today, that the government has put a lot of effort into improving services, and there is very material evidence that the various initiatives we have put in place are being rolled out and are making a difference. I must say I can personally attest to that: the mobile phone coverage in my own electorate has improved dramatically -  - My own electorate -  and I do know a bit about bush electorates; I live in one - is the size of England and Scotland combined. It has 60 or 70 centres in it, and a very large number of them have mobile phone services as a result of programs such as Networking the Nation, which we put into place. I would be more than interested in obtaining the details from the honourable member in relation to somebody who appears to be having a little trouble with Telstra services. We get them from time to time in our office. It is not so many years ago that under the ALP we still all had party lines out there. Perhaps they would all like us to go back to party lines. They were terrific: you had about 10 people on each one. As Tim Fischer observed the other day, you could -  -  - Mr Speaker, no doubt about them: they are really interested in answers. I dare say that the honourable member for Maranoa's constituents are waiting for an answer; they might like to hear it. I would like to invite them to contact either their member or me - or, if they must, through the honourable member who raised the issue -  with the details of their problem and we will most assuredly take it up with Telstra. We have not pretended for a moment that all of the service issues have been sorted out; we have made that very plain but, unlike you, we have a commitment to getting them right. I finish with a rhetorical question: where was the ALP's customer service guarantee? </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know how he has worked hard with his constituents in both an urban and semirural setting to improve their telecommunications. As a result, many of his constituents in the valleys of the Blue Mountains are much better off because of the government's reforms and the injection of some $1 billion - that is the allocation overwhelmingly for regional and rural Australia. As a result, there are faster repair and service connection times, and temporary service is available where it takes more than five working days to repair. Every town in Australia that has a population of more than 500 will have mobile phone coverage for the first time; $52 million has been made available under the health and education networks - under the National Communications Fund - for the first time in history. Every person living in the outer extended zones, covering 80 per cent of Australia, can call their neighbour for the cost of a local call, and the government, of course, has used the highly successful Networking the Nation program, with more than 600 projects to date for mobile phone coverage, Internet access and training. There is a $120 million television fund, and the list goes on and on. All of these reforms - all of this allocation and new funding - were opposed by Labor, and all of these improvements would be lost under Labor.I am asked about alternative policies. What would Labor do? The member for Melbourne has released formally a paper which shows us exactly what Labor would do, which is very reminiscent of the old proposal of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who through the 1996 election was revealed as wishing to break up Telstra and sell off parts of it to IBM - for those who have a sense of political memory. Now the member for Melbourne is revisiting the same plan -  the Keating plan mark 2, if you like.Essentially his plan is, in a corporate sense, to break up Telstra. It would strip Telstra of its profitability and would rip the heart out of it. Instead of dealing with one company that has a range of services, you would go to several companies. You would go to one for an Internet connection; you would go to one for maintenance or connection; you would go to another for mobile phone apparatus; you would go to another for access to a fixed network. So instead of going to one company, whose strength is that it would cover all services, you would have to go to several. That would decrease Telstra's profitability and increase inconvenience and costs to customers. You would therefore massively reduce the shareholder value in Telstra and two million shareholders in Telstra would lose out. Their shares would decrease in value. You would prevent Telstra from growing and investing in new infrastructure. You would turn the regulatory regime on its head because you would create massive uncertainty for the entire industry and it would result in fundamental duplication of Telstra's resources, therefore increasing the price paid by consumers.I am very interested for the honourable member to clear up a matter for the House and for the general public because last August he took a personal explanation in the parliament explaining that he had not canvassed any of these issues or potential policy decisions with Macquarie Bank. - He says he did not say that. In that case, I will quote from his personal explanation to the parliament on 27 August: In question time last Thursday the Minister for Finance and Administration stated that the member for Perth and I had secretly visited investment banks to get advice on how to sell off the profitable bits of Telstra. That is a lie. That is a totally untrue statement.Isn't it is curious that his current proposals are exactly that - exactly the things he denied to the parliament he had canvassed with Macquarie or any other investment bank? All I can say is that if you did not then you should have canvassed those wacky ideas with someone with commercial or business sense because they would have pointed out to you what a disaster they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. How could anyone lead with their chin to such an extent as that? That CS First Boston report correlates with the honourable member's proposal to structurally break up Telstra. There is no doubt at all. Last Friday's Australian got it right when it reported:Investment bank CSFB said yesterday a structural separation of Telstra between its wholesale and retail divisions could hit Telstra shares hard, with a worst case scenario of Telstra shares sinking to as low as $4.The government has dealt with an accounting separation with regard to Telstra. This report deals with significantly more devastating impacts on Telstra, such as corporate break up. I will quote from the report:But more substantial separation scenarios - remember `more substantial separation scenarios' -  - such as corporately breaking up Telstra - ... would have the potential to reduce these returns over time. This could have quite a significant impact on value: for example reducing the long run excess return by Telstra to 6% would reduce valuation to $4.50; reducing it to 4% would reduce valuation to $4.The share price at the time of the report was $5.08. Under the worst-case scenario, CS First Boston estimated that it would reduce the share price by over $1 a share. This is related to more extreme structural separation, such as the ringbarking the member for Melbourne proposes in his discussion paper. That is the point. The devastating effect on Telstra's share price comes about after structural separation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and note her very real interest in transport, particularly given the importance of Wagga as a transport hub. Last week I released the government's new approach to land transport planning, which we have dubbed AusLink. This aims to make land transport more efficient, make it safer and produce better environmental outcomes. We are seeking to look beyond the immediate headlines of today and tomorrow and the electoral cycle to making the hard decisions that are going to be needed in the national interest in relation to our transport infrastructure.We face some particularly big challenges. The freight task in Australia, with a very strongly growing economy, will well and truly outstrip both population growth and economic growth. Indeed, with the likely doubling, for example, of the number of trucks on our roads over the next 18 years, without a serious attempt to address these issues we will face real problems of congestion, of interruption to amenity and of pollution and what have you in our major cities -  as well as very real difficulties in simply delivering the money and resources needed to keep our national highway system up to scratch to do it.We are proposing that the federal government will sponsor the development of a five- to 10-year indicative rolling transport plan in consultation with, and providing for input from, the states, the territories, communities and, importantly, for the first time, the private sector. The private sector have shown a very real interest in delivering a better logistics sector in Australia. They see it as critical to the development of the Australian economy and to our export performance. Of course, there has been a reaction to the idea of greater private sector involvement. I have heard a couple of state Labor ministers say, `It means tolls.' They say that it will mean tolls in North Queensland on the national highway grid. I want to highlight that that is nonsense, that anyone who knows anything about paying for roads will know that lightly trafficked national highways would not support tolls even if there were a government of a mind that wanted to do it.When it comes to private sector investment, it is desirable that we capture more of it. A very good example of that has arisen in the sale of National Rail and FreightCorp to the consortium formed by Corrigan and Toll. Not only have they taken over that rolling stock - far better for the private sector to operate that rolling stock than governments, in my view - on the interstate mainline tracks but, furthermore, they have committed themselves to investing further moneys in the interstate track, subject to a contribution from us, which we are in a position to make. That is leveraging with taxpayers' money private sector contributions - and both sides win. It extends the taxpayers' dollar further and it also makes sure that we use it more efficiently - music, I would have thought, to a Treasurer's ears. I should also add that, very importantly, there will be no reduction, no clipping, of any of the commitments we have made. Whether it is to Scoresby or to such important programs as Roads to Recovery or the Black Spots program - $180 million for a very important program - we will continue those.The reaction from many people has been very good indeed. The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria said that it is good that the Commonwealth is talking about a national vision for transport and showing leadership. The National Farmers Federation welcomed it. The Australian Railway Association said:The ARA congratulates the government for taking a long-term view of transport planning and funding and agrees with the minister's summary. AusLink is a major step towards making our land transport system safer and more efficient with less impact on the environment.The Local Government Association also welcomed it and said that it is incumbent on all spheres of government to work cooperatively on this plan. Of course, there is a bit of a problem there, because what did the Labor ministers do, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales? Before they could possibly have had a chance to study the plan, they came out and panned it and said that it would not work, that it was an unworkable plan, that it could not be made to succeed. One even dubbed it `AusDud'. I was very interested then to note - as they say, success has many fathers - the media release by my opposite number, the member for Batman. I will just read the relevant excerpts. It said: Labor welcomes the Minister for Transport's support for Labor's long-standing policy on a national transport plan - and - the Minister will use a Labor policy to meet Australia's future transport infrastructure needs. - He changes the subject: `What about Badgery's Creek?' There's a bit of a change of subject for you. I challenge the member for Batman to go to his state colleagues and say, `What the Commonwealth is proposing is in the Australian national interest and you ought to get on board.'</DOC>

 - If the honourable member were to read the transcript of what Senator Boswell said on Sunday, he would recognise that Senator Boswell, like me, has alluded to improving services. I have outlined why they are improving: we are putting some real effort and resources into it. That is important to acknowledge. This is not a question of an ideological position here. I am, broadly speaking - as I think is well known - in favour of free enterprise. I do not particularly favour the idea of things like state controlled agriculture, or a state run trucking industry or a state owned automotive industry. Britain had one of those once. When I was a schoolboy, Britain had a state owned motorcar industry. Two out of five cars made in the world were made in Great Britain. They were so appalling - with all due respects to the British transport minister - that there was a saying in this country that, if you bought a British car, you had to buy a second one so that you had one to use all the time.So just to make the point - because I think it is an important one - generally speaking, this is not an ideological commitment. What is important is that we get the services country Australians need. That has been my commitment, my party's commitment, the coalition's commitment, the commitment of thinking people everywhere on this issue. The difference is that we have put in place the policies and the strategies to make it happen. There is nothing inconsistent at all with us saying, with good justification, and with plenty of evidence, that the services are improving but that, at the same time, they are not yet fully up to scratch. What Senator Boswell said, and I reiterate it again here today, is that at some stage, to keep faith with rural and regional Australians, we will have to objectively benchmark that. That is fair and reasonable. All I need to say is that we will keep faith with country people - we have always done that - and in due course, when the government is ready, we will say what we will do about that benchmarking process.  But I reiterate two further points. We are about getting country Australia the services, the reliability and the cost effectiveness in telecommunications it needs so that it can fully participate in the activities of national economic life, so that it can reach its potential and so that it can do everything possible for the nation's economic growth. That is point number one. That is about getting the standards right, about getting country people the services they need. Point two, I reiterate, is that we are not in the business of dudding country people on this. Our commitment to their services is real and it stands -  - in stark contrast to the ALP's refusal on their form when they were in government to do anything at all about country services. They continue today in the document that they released last week with their plans for the future of telecommunications. I repeat: there is nothing in it in relation to services for country people apart from the utterly absurd and superficial claim that somehow service levels are related to public ownership. If they were, we would have had decent services back in the days of party lines and the PMG.</DOC>

 - I have a very clear answer to the excellent question from the member for Mackellar. This government believes in democracy. We believe in government of the people, by the people, for the people. We do not believe in government of the people by the unions for the unions. We believe in one man, one vote. We do not believe in one man, one thousand votes if you happen to be the union secretary. Let me make it very clear to this House that business organisations have no block vote inside the Liberal Party, farm organisations have no block vote inside the National Party and Green organisations have no block vote inside the Australian Democrats. Unions have no block vote inside the British Labour Party, and unions should have no block vote inside the Australian Labor Party. -  - When the Leader of the Opposition took over the ALP, he said that things were going to be different. He said that he was going to be a party reformer. He said that he did not want the ALP to be nothing but the political wing of the ACTU. Having made the big promises, the Leader of the Opposition's great reform turns out to be changing the unions' shareholding from 60 per cent to 50 per cent. He is changing a majority shareholding to a controlling shareholding - a distinction without a difference. It is a cosmetic change on a par with the Leader of the Opposition's pathetic attempts to deepen his voice. Having come up with a dud policy, he squibbed the chance to fight for it. He swaggered up to Sydney saying that he had never walked away from a fight in his life. The only fight he is interested in is one that has the result rigged in advance. He was mugged by the mates, not once but twice. The union heavies took him backstage at the Sydney Town Hall and they intimidated him into changing his speech, which turned out to be the biggest anti-climax since Halley's comet. Then, after the Leader of the Opposition had slunk out like a beaten impostor, Neville Wran, the most successful Labor leader of his generation, stood up and accused him of taking what he called `the Howard-Abbott bait'. He said of the Leader of the Opposition, `The party is a creation of the trade unions. Why we even have to mention the 60-40 rule is beyond my comprehension.' That is the verdict of Neville Wran on the pathetic, gutless political failure of the Leader of the Opposition, who talks about everything except what he really believes in. Members on this side of the House are governing the country and members opposite cannot even govern their own party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This comes from the wholly owned subsidiary of the ACTU over there, facing some ballistic shareholders in New South Wales - the same group of people who, when we launched the Besley inquiry, immediately set out to denigrate the people on the panel and to say that it would not be a fair dinkum inquiry, that they would not do a real job and that it was just a whitewash and a puppeteer's job. In my view, this was grossly insulting those on the panel - decent, reputable Australians all of them, who did a decent and reputable job and gave us a no-holds barred assessment of the shortfalls in telecommunications in rural and regional areas. It was a fair dinkum process and we gave a fair dinkum response.We did not dud country people then, and we are not going to dud country people next time around - in due course, when we have established the best way forward. We have made it quite plain that any further sale of Telstra is conditional upon a fair and proper process of establishing that the needs of rural people have been addressed. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition. The point that I make is this: we did not dud them last time and we are not going to this time. If there is one thing I can say with absolute surety in this place, it is that country Australia would rather have us dealing with their telecommunications future than you.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Wannon for his question. I had the opportunity to meet a number of small business owners in his electorate recently and they are all pretty happy with the direction of the economy. They are very happy with the fact that growth is up. They are very happy with the fact that employment is up. They are very happy with the fact that business confidence is high. That has been reinforced today by the release of the Yellow Pages small to medium enterprise index, which reported that in the last quarter there has been a surge in business confidence, with the current levels the highest since the May 1996 index. Moreover, small businesses are confident that the Australian economy will continue to grow and their employment expectations are for future growth, with 10 per cent of small businesses expected to increase the size of their work force in the next quarter. Of course, there have been a number of factors that have contributed to this: the strong Australian economy, the responsible attitude of the government towards budgeting for the future, the commitment of the government to continue with workplace relations changes and a range of other initiatives. Perhaps there is one other factor that is giving small business confidence: it is the fact that the Labor Party has dumped rollback. Perhaps that has some impact. After five years the Labor Party decided to dump rollback, and it was in a speech to the Fabian Society conference on Saturday, 4 May 2002 by the shadow Treasurer. He said:After five years as the centrepiece of our tax policy and after two election defeats, it is time to reassess our priorities.I went looking for this speech and it was very hard to obtain. I went to the Labor Party web site and there are over 770 listings of speeches and statements from 14 February this year but there is one that is missing: the rollback of rollback speech - the full speech, no comment, no question. You have to ask why. Are they a little embarrassed about it? Could it be that Frankenstein's monster took a lot to kill, or could it be the fact that they made Dr Frankenstein the Leader of the Opposition?  - The architect of the rollback policy is now the Leader of the Opposition, and it took the shadow Treasurer on a Saturday in an unpublished speech to go out and to kill rollback. That says a lot about the policy development of the Labor Party. It says a lot about the fact that for five years they ran hard on rollback and then on one Saturday in an unpublished speech it was not even the architect of rollback that killed it; it was the shadow Treasurer. Small business has confidence in the way the Howard government is taking it and they have absolutely no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and express my appreciation that the ALP is showing so much concern for telecommunication services in rural Australia. Can I at the outset repudiate, though, the member's - I think -  very cheap slur: that I ridiculed the farmer from Chinchilla yesterday.  - I did not ridicule him. Those members who were interested enough to be listening to my answer yesterday would have heard me say that I would be only too happy, if he were to contact me, to have the problems of the member for Maranoa's constituent investigated. I would have been perfectly happy to have done that.Let me make a couple of other comments. Plainly, he has experienced some difficulties. I did actually inquire as to whether or not he had mobile phone coverage. I found, interestingly enough, that he has a little fortuitous coverage and at this stage they do not have a tower but, under a program put in place by us called Networking the Nation, they may shortly get mobile phone coverage via a CDMA tower. I trust that the member for McMillan has explained to the member for Maranoa's constituent that if the coalition had not moved to replace the analog phone system that the ALP cancelled he would not have access to mobile phones in any way, shape or form.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and recognise the great interest he has in Australia's determination to protect its borders - and for the excellent work, by the way, that he does for the people of Fairfax as well, both here and back in his electorate. Australia does have a broad range and growing program of cooperation with both Indonesia and Thailand on people-smuggling. Both of those countries support our commitment to taking strong action, decisive action, against the activities of people smugglers.Last week I visited both Indonesia and Thailand, and while I was in Jakarta I was able to meet not only with my counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Hassan Wirajuda, but also with the Cabinet Secretary, Bambang Kesowo, and the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. During my visit to Thailand I had the opportunity of meeting with the Prime Minister and the foreign minister. What was significant on this issue during my visit was the determination by both Indonesia and Thailand to work with Australia to deal with people-smuggling as a follow-up to the conference that took place in Bali, co-chaired by Australia and Indonesia, at the end of February.In the course of this afternoon, with our ambassador for people-smuggling, John Buckley, I shall be meeting with senior officials from Thailand and Indonesia to discuss the activities of the two working groups that we established at the Bali conference. Since April, Ambassador Buckley has travelled throughout the region very productively.Australia, Thailand and Indonesia, as well as other key countries, are cooperating in a whole range of different areas to address people-smuggling: through sharing of intelligence, through cooperation between our police forces, through cooperation between our immigration officials and so on. It is true to say that this cooperation, coupled with a message that Australia sends out to the world - that it is determined to protect its own borders in an unequivocal way - has proved to be effective. There is no doubt about that. Since November last year, no boat has managed to land with unauthorised arrivals on Australia's shores. We should not, though, for a minute be complacent about that and make a claim that no boat could ever arrive. Obviously, that would be possible. But the fact is that this government has - in the teeth of a lot of opposition, by the way, from those opposite - been very determined to address this issue, and it has been effective in addressing this issue.The honourable member asked if there were any alternative approaches. The fact is that the approach of the alternative government in this country, the Australian Labor Party, is an approach that does not bear description. It is little short of a shambles. For example, on the issue of mandatory detention of illegal migrants to Australia, the Leader of the Opposition this morning was out there at his doorstop - the Leader of the Opposition's doorstops always make a great read; we enjoy reading them during our question time meetings - playing it both ways: `Maybe detention for a short period of time, but we are not really sure about the detention.' The New South Wales Labor Party says that mandatory detention should be abolished and the Leader of the Opposition is out there in the public saying, `Oh, no, I support mandatory detention.' In fact, so bold was he that he said a little while ago, `No-one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.' I think the New South Wales Labor Party, or significant elements of it, may disagree with that. Of course, there are plenty of people sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition who do disagree with mandatory detention, who went to the last election arguing that they all supported the government on this issue. They won votes from people on the basis of supporting the government on this issue and, as soon as the votes were counted, they were out there saying, `We're not really sure about this' - people like the member for Fremantle, the member for Sydney; all the usual suspects from out there on the far left of the Labor Party; all the bourgeois leftists out there. During the election campaign they said, `We agree with the government,' and when the campaign was over they said they did not. But I know that at the end of 2004 and early 2005 you will be agreeing with the government; you will be clinging to us. Then a week or two after the election, you will be saying, `Oh, we didn't really mean that.' Bourgeois leftists, I am afraid, send out confusing messages.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As outlined by the Treasurer on budget night, the government has indisputably delivered on its commitment to strengthen Australia's defences, to fight the war on terrorism and to protect our borders. Defence will receive an additional $1 billion in 2002-03 in line with the government's white paper funding commitment. Additional funding of the deployment of Australian troops in the war against terrorism in 2002-03 is around $524 million. This government will also be allocating an additional -   -  - The government will also be allocating an additional $1.3 billion over five years for a range of measures to upgrade security within Australia. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. In accordance with established practice, Defence does operate on a no-win, no-loss basis. Unlike the opposition, which is intent on furrowing its brow, gripping its hands and paying lip-service, this government is intent upon honouring its commitment to the Australian people and funding to support real improvement in our security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for the question because I know the honourable member for Dunkley is very interested in and supportive of efforts to ensure that we maintain an efficacious migration program and, particularly, have places available to help those offshore who may need resettlement places in Australia. The one way you can maximise places for those who have the greatest need is to be able to ensure that those who are seeking to come to Australia, and in some cases make asylum claims, are properly tested and, if they are not refugees, make them available for removal.It is very important I think for members to be aware that there has been very considerable processing of those who have come since July 1999. More than 9,200 claims were assessed and the number of boat arrivals in detention now awaiting a primary protection visa and those who are being held having made asylum claims has fallen rather dramatically. At the moment we would have something of the order of 700 people in detention in Australia who arrived unlawfully by boat. The number awaiting a primary protection visa decision has declined from 1,159 in August 2001 to just 53 as at 17 May.It may be illuminating for members to see this table in relation to boat arrivals being processed in Australia at the moment. It reveals that we have only 53 applicants who are awaiting a primary decision. We have 352 people who have had protection visa claims finalised. We have 74 people who have applications before the Refugee Review Tribunal. We have 29 cases where the claims have been considered by the Refugee Review Tribunal and remitted. We have 220 at the moment who are before the courts seeking judicial review. I have also a table that members may be interested in dealing with those matters in percentage terms. It shows that more than 49 per cent of people - 352 - are being held for removal. They are not refugees. It is very important to have an understanding of that.I hear from time to time that there are policy approaches calling for streamlining the processes to enable prompt decision making. If people come with documents, decisions can be made within four or five weeks - and were. More complex cases can take longer, particularly where there are identity fraud issues and credibility concerns and where there is a general absence of identity documentation. The fact is that we have been able to get to a point now, with no boat arrivals onshore in Australia since November of last year, where very few people are pursuing primary applications. I have noticed that some people have been suggesting that this is not the result of government policy; it is in some way a result of the weather. I would have to say that this has been the longest monsoon season on record in Australia - some seven months. The fact is that government policies are working. We are not claiming victory but we are working towards, and remaining vigilant in, protecting our borders. Are there other approaches? There are. There are some people who believe you should dismantle mandatory detention and give people the very clear signal that if they get to Australia they will be in the community. - I will not name them all. That is what they argue. Some people argue that you should not, in effect, protect your borders and you should not send people back even if they are going back to a situation where they are safe and secure. And some people argue that you should not process people in offshore centres. Each of those measures has had a very significant impact on ensuring that Australia has a very small problem in comparison to what we see elsewhere in the world. Essentially, they are arguing that we should adopt the failed policies that have led to a situation where the sort of approach that we are taking could be implemented. In the United Kingdom - and I have read about Tony Blair's secret plan where they are now talking of using the defence forces - we saw in the London Telegraph on 19 May that asylum seekers are disappearing into the community in the United Kingdom at 130 a day, or 276,000 in the last decade. People who have received negative decisions in relation to asylum claims are not available for removal. If you want further evidence of that, there were reports out of France earlier this year of more than 90 per cent of asylum seekers disappearing. The United States of America immigration service web site reports that 89 per cent of non-detained individuals with final orders for removal fail to surrender for deportation. I notice that some people say we ought to be adopting the Swedish model. Aside from the fact that they have the most draconian measures that apply to the whole of their population to enable them to identify where people are, Sweden saw a 100 per cent increase in asylum claims this year. In other words, when you look at the alternatives that are being advocated, they are alternatives that have failed Europe and have failed them in terms of being able to manage their borders. - I hear the honourable member saying that they obviously do not consider it to be a problem. You ought to talk to some of your fraternal colleagues in the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. They recognise that, if you fail to manage these issues, they can have a very destructive impact upon your social cohesion. We are one of the most tolerant, diverse societies in the world because we have been able to manage our borders and our programs successfully over a long period of time. I do not want to draw too many conclusions. I just hope that the Labor Party can remain vigilant in supporting us on these issues. In relation to those issues that delay people's final decision in relation to the questions of the way in which the courts are again taking a proactive position to undermine the efforts that this parliament supported as recently as the end of last year, I hope you will be onside again when it is necessary to implement those measures and we will not be waiting round for three or four years to find out whether you are going to come to the table.</DOC>

 - In my capacity as representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, who made an announcement on this subject, I am very happy to inform the House of the government's position. The minister for finance on 28 May, yesterday, announced the government's position in relation to foreign exchange risk management. He did that after a careful evaluation of the report of the Australian National Audit Office which the question referred to. He also did that after taking independent advice, including from Access Economics, the economic adviser to the Labor Party. Access Economics in its report - a report with which I thoroughly concur - gave four reasons why there should not be hedging in relation to individual departments. The first reason is that the government benefits from a huge natural hedge - that is, that the government holds foreign denominated assets, particularly at the Reserve Bank and, in relation to a devaluation where you hold those foreign assets in relation to that natural hedge, you make a considerable dividend. - In fact, as the dividends from the Reserve Bank have shown, over recent years -  - it has made huge dividends in relation to the holding of foreign assets.The second point that was made by Access Economics in its report was that the government is large enough to self-insure - that is, the government has incomes in foreign currencies as well as outlays in foreign currencies and spreading its risk over the whole of its operations gives it the capacity to self-insure. The third reason that Access Economics gave was that the government can take a long term in relation to these matters - that is, it takes a much longer term in relation to currency movements than the financial markets do. If I may say so, if individual departments were in fact hedging, they most likely could be in a position where they were hedging against each other and hedging against the government's overall position in relation to the currency. The fourth reason that Access Economics gave which the government accepted in relation to the report of the ANAO was that now is not the time to change the policy, particularly at a time of appreciation in relation to the Australian dollar. What the questioner obviously overlooked was the fact that since 30 June in this financial year there has been a very large appreciation in the Australian dollar which has actually worked to the advantage of the defence department. If you had entered into currency hedging at the beginning of the financial year, as the Australian Labor Party was recommending, the defence department would have lost the benefits of the appreciation in relation to the Australian dollar. For all of those reasons, the defence department is operating, as it did under the Labor Party, on a no-win, no-loss basis, as the minister explained. That is, in those years when there was a depreciation and foreign currency contracts required more Australian dollars, they were supplemented; in years like this year, where the Australian dollar is actually appreciating and they would get a decrease in a foreign currency contract, they will have to return their wins back to the budget. There will be no wins; there will be no loss - endorsed by Access Economics, announced by the minister for finance, the policy of the Australian Labor Party and, as the minister so adequately explained, a position which protects Defence as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I thank him for his interest in economic policy and questions in relation to budget policy at least from this side of the House. I can inform the honourable member for Wentworth that the government's economic strategy, since it was elected in 1996, has now repaid, by the end of the 2002-03 financial year, $61 billion of the Labor Party's debt - that is, of the $96 billion of Labor Party debt, this coalition government has now retired $61 billion, undoing the damage of the Labor Party years. In addition to the lowest interest rates in 30 years, 928,000 new jobs have been created in Australia during that period. In its response to the budget, the Australian Labor Party indicated that it intends to oppose savings measures which will allow us to take fiscal policy further. It is opposing measures which would save over four years $1.5 billion in relation to the disability support pension and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Utter irresponsibility - attacking the government's physical strategy in the vain hope that the economic consequences that follow will somehow damage the government's standing in the community! But that is not all. In his budget reply, in addition to blocking $1.5 billion of measures over four years in savings, the Leader of the Opposition alluded to the fact that he wants to offer $6 billion in tax credits - $6 billion in tax credits, which he has not announced how he would fund. He had a $500 million to $1 billion hole in his superannuation proposals. On 21 May, the member for Perth said he wants $500 million per year extra into Medicare. On 15 May, the Leader of the Opposition said he wanted an Australian Coastguard. The member for Cunningham wants to increase the Austrade budget. He wants to increase the export market development grants. The member for Gellibrand wants to increase initiatives in children's health. The member for Werriwa - one of the last of the great spenders - wants matched savings accounts, and he wants to give more money to people to buy shares, although it is not entirely clear if there is any other member of the Labor Party who agrees with him on this point, and it certainly was not mentioned in the Leader of the Opposition's reply. So there we are: $1.5 billion of savings which they are voting against plus, conservatively, probably about an $8 billion or $9 billion unfunded promise coming out of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. Bob McMullan said this to the Fabian Society on 4 May 2002:There is evidence to suggest that one public perception which distinguishes Labor's success at a local level from our recent failures at the national level has been fear of a lack of discipline in our fiscal policy - why would he have said that; we are only about $10 billion and counting - and concern about the implications of this for interest rates. That was the famous speech where he buried the roll-back policy. I was watching last night on TV where they are going to take a gene from a Tasmanian tiger - an extinct species - and bring it back to life. I thought if they could take something from the roll-back policy and clone that back to life we could actually see what an extinct Labor policy looks like. We could actually understand what he really had in mind after five years of work on the roll-back policy. `Roll-back' - there is a word we do not hear much around here anymore. There are no salads in plastic bags anymore, are there? No Hockey bear pyjamas down here at the dispatch box. Some people would describe these as mickey mouse policies. It took me back to Don Watson in his biography of Paul Keating. He said:Mickey Mouse was a name to be feared by all advisers in the Keating office. To be touched by those two words was poison. Bleeding heart, froth, fairy floss and Creanites were others. A Creanite was someone who sympathised with industry policy of the kind advocated by Simon Crean. These names were dreaded in the way that Trotskyist and revisionists were dreaded in another time and another place. You knew your economic credibility was shot. That was the previous Labor government, where `Creanite' was a term of abuse which meant your economic policy was shot. They are now all Creanites. The Labor Party frontbench - Simon and the Creanites they call them. Simon and Creanites! Once upon a time, the Labor Party stood for economic responsibility; now it is a Creanite party.</DOC>

 - That is a very good leaflet, and I would recommend it to the Leader of the Opposition. It is true that it is taxpayer funded, in the sense that it comes out of a member's entitlement, but I do not think I would be the only member in this place who uses their member's entitlement. I may not spend as much as the former member for Paterson. If he had not spent that money, he could probably have floated the whole Commonwealth account himself. It is a good leaflet; it gives a good explanation of Australia's budget position. We believe that Australia's budget position is in a sound place. We have repaid $62 billion worth of Labor Party debt; we are budgeting for a surplus; we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years; and we could do even better if the Labor Party would pass our budget through the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. At a time when the economy is certainly doing very well, not only by historical standards but also by international standards - prosperity levels are rising, unemployment is falling and opportunities for young Australians have probably never been as outstanding as they are at the moment - it is important to remember that there are regions, both rural and urban, where for various reasons things are not so bright. This government has not forgotten those regions. - I am glad that the member for McMillan is indicating his support for doing something for these regions. He might be able to persuade the member for Batman of the value of the Sustainable Regions program. It has now been successfully implemented in eight prototype regions: Campbelltown and Camden, the far north-east of New South Wales, Gippsland, Playford and Salisbury in South Australia, the Kimberley region in Western Australia, the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, the Atherton Tablelands and Wide Bay Burnett. Some of these regions are unquestionably doing it tough. As an indicator of that, last night I was told that in Rosebery, on the west coast of Tasmania, it is possible to purchase a home outright by simply using the government's first home owner's grant - and you can take change home after that - which does tell a story. In some of these regions, intergenerational unemployment is a major concern. That is something that the Sustainable Regions program will be particularly targeting. Local advisory committees are now established in each region. They are starting to work well. During the day and again last night, I met the chairs and the executive officers of those advisory committees at an all-day meeting hosted here by my department. I express my strong appreciation for the ministerial support of the program. I note that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs were with us last night, as we met with these people and talked about their hopes for revitalising investment and employment opportunities in these regions. One advisory committee member told me of a plan for an integrated approach to developing 1,000 jobs over the next couple of years in their depressed region. That sort of approach, working in partnership with local leadership, is what the government is looking for.The member for Macarthur asked me whether I was aware of any alternative policies. I am afraid to say that I am. At the last election, despite the member for McMillan's apparent enthusiasm to see the program expanded, the Labor Party's policy was to abandon the program - it was to scrap it; it was to do away with it. In fact, their alternative policy proposal was to say to depressed regions -  - Rubbish? I will find it; I will dig it out for you. I would love to dig it out. I will dig it out and I will table it. Their proposal, as a substitute, was that -  -  - depressed regions should go out and borrow; they should go into debt to fund regional development. I note that the member for Macarthur, who is in regular contact with me about the program in his area, somewhat outdoes the member for Werriwa, who is always expressing his concerns about programs for depressed areas in regional Australia but has shown no interest whatsoever in the program in his own backyard. I would also have thought that the member for Lyons, who yesterday became a bit excited about the politics of Telstra, might have been interested as well in the Sustainable Regions program. I do not think I have had a single contact or letter from him, and yet, as I said, in his part of the world Australians have very real needs, which this government is determined to meet, who, for whatever reason - and usually it is rapid technological change more than anything else - are not quite enjoying the same level of opportunities that are spreading through the rest of the community as a result of sound management. I again simply make the point: Labor's approach was to scrap this program altogether and to replace it with loans. Their objective was to drive hard-pressed regions into debt.</DOC>

Those standards are set by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, which is an organisation representing the Commonwealth, the states, the territories and New Zealand. We cooperate as best we can to develop standards which ensure that there are no unacceptable residues in Australian food products, whether they be imported or produced domestically. The same standards apply to domestically produced products as apply to imported products. Products coming into Australia are tested to ensure that they meet the appropriate standards. I am not aware of the particular circumstances of the import referred to by the honourable member but I will seek some more information on that particular issue, and if there is anything further to report to the House I will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question and for his vigorous participation in internal party democracy. I am aware of a power struggle inside the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union between Doug Cameron, the man who wants Australia's car industry to operate on a stop-start basis, and Craig Johnson, the leader of the ultramilitant Workers First faction, who currently faces criminal charges arising from a series of violent site invasions in Victoria. The Leader of the Opposition's commendable concern to curtail violence in Western Sydney contrasts with his deafening silence about increasing violence inside the trade union movement. Regrettably, inside the AMWU it is militant versus ultramilitant. - It is Marxist versus maniac. Doug Cameron stands in the tradition of Senator George Campbell, who was famously described by Paul Keating as having 100,000 dead men around his neck as a result of his role in deepening the 1983 recession. Craig Johnson's commitment to creating employment involves turning up uninvited outside a business and exercising his right of entry by smashing down the door with a crowbar. I have been asked about alternative policy development. I can inform the House that the AMWU over the last six years has donated $3 million to the Labor Party - and $3 million is responsible for a hell of a lot of policy development. Thanks to the notorious 60-40 rule, the AMWU has the largest single bloc vote inside the Victorian Labor Party. Because the AMWU cannot decide whether to pay its dues and send its delegation, the Victorian Labor Party cannot elect a president and it cannot fill some 50 other positions. - Thanks to the 60-40 rule, 13 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a Trotskyite is able to sabotage the operation of the Victorian Labor Party. - But do not expect a Creanite to fix the situation, Mr Speaker. - As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by points of order, a Trotskyite is sabotaging the Victorian ALP and don't expect a Creanite to fix it! The Leader of the Opposition -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me simply observe that touchiness in the parliament is always a product of tension in the caucus! The Leader of the Opposition proposes to reduce the union shareholding from 60 per cent to 50 per cent. For the benefit of members opposite, let me remind the House that Rupert Murdoch controls News Limited with a 30 per cent shareholding, so a 50 per cent union block vote will still mean that the ALP is owned and operated by the union movement and still nothing but the political arm of the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for asking this question because he knows just as well as the members on this side of the House that reform is absolutely critical when it comes to disability support pensioners and, in particular, in respect of providing incentives to focus on ability rather than disability and leaving many of these 650,000 people languishing on a disability support pension until they reach pensionable age. I might add that, when it comes to the DSP, it is interesting that when the Labor Party was in government in the early 1990s you changed the invalid pension to the DSP -  - perhaps not for the intent of helping people on DSP but for reducing unemployment figures in that particular year. You stand over there with such sincerity yet you yourself, member for Lilley, can be quoted on numerous occasions as saying - Opposition members - You! - Mr Speaker, obviously not you; you are doing a tremendous job as the Speaker. But, member for Lilley, you yourself have stated:Solutions must be found to the growth in DSP in order to ensure people with disabilities have the fullest opportunity available to reach their potential and make their contribution. - So from the structural mess that we inherited from the Australian Labor Party, this government, through the McClure report and legislation that will come before the parliament this afternoon, will ensure that those people with disabilities that may not qualify for a disability support pension in the future will be put into adequate rehabilitation and training courses. We are making 73,000 places available for that. What is more, more money will be going into the Commonwealth-state disability agreement as well as into employment services - an increase from $1.3 billion to $2 billion. The challenge for the opposition is to support these measures, which will ultimately mean giving people with disabilities an opportunity to participate in the work force to reach their maximum potential -   - rather than let these people languish on the disability support pension, which was clearly your policy for years whether by accident or by design.</DOC>

 - As the member for Pearce well knows, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality is the biggest and probably most important environment program that has ever been implemented in this country. It will address some of the very serious issues associated with salinity and water quality which are threatening the lifestyles of many Australians and indeed much of our precious environmental biodiveristy. The reality is that the Commonwealth immediately put $700 million for this program on the table and, bit by bit, the states are finally coming on board to participate in this magnificent initiative.Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced that agreement has been reached with New South Wales. Bilateral agreements have been signed and $400 million will now start to flow towards addressing significant salinity and water quality issues in that state. Money is already flowing to Queensland, to South Australia and particularly to Victoria to undertake programs in those states following bilateral agreements which have enabled the action plans to be put in place.I am pleased to report to the House also that early last week Western Australia at last signed the intergovernmental agreement. It has taken them a year and a half, but finally the Western Australian government has agreed to sign the intergovernmental agreement. Western Australia has, sadly, been left a long way behind the other states by the reluctance of its state government to take on board this initiative which has been so welcomed by people who are actually affected by the problems of salinity and water quality. Indeed, in Western Australia, farm organisations, community organisations and, I might add, members on this side of the House have been very vocal in demanding that Western Australia participate promptly in this program and ensure that funds start to flow to that state.I am somewhat disappointed, however, to find that the Western Australian government have attached a significant number of conditions to their involvement in the intergovernmental agreement, and that is going to make it hard for us to negotiate a satisfactory bilateral arrangement to enable funding to flow. I guess chief amongst my disappointments is the fact that, even though the Commonwealth has offered Western Australia $158 million under the national action plan, Western Australia are only prepared to put up $60 million. As a result, instead of $316 million being available for essential salinity and water quality projects in Western Australia, only $122 million will be provided.That is very disappointing, because most people who know something about salinity acknowledge that some of the biggest problems are in Western Australia, some of the biggest issues that need to be addressed are in WA and also many land-holders in Western Australia and community groups have probably done more than those in other states on their own accord to address these sorts of issues. These are the people who wanted to participate in the national action plan and see these sorts of things occur.The honourable member for Kalgoorlie will be particularly interested to know that the Western Australian government have also indicated that they do not propose to fund any works in one of the priority regions under the national action plan, the Ord River. So there will be no money available under these arrangements, if Western Australia have their way, for programs in the Ord - one of the major areas for agriculture and where salinity issues are a rising concern. In the electorate of the honourable member for Pearce, the upper Swan Valley and the Avon Valley are particular priority regions. Under these arrangements, there will only be about one-third as much money available for projects in that region as there could have been if Western Australia had properly embraced this program and been a part of ensuring that all of Australia could reap the benefits of the national action plan. We will be patient in working with Western Australia to try and find satisfactory solutions. I am pleased that they are at least committing themselves to the intergovernmental agreement. But we can only be patient for a certain amount of time. Other states would be only too happy to take up the $100 million that it seems Western Australia are prepared to turn down. There are members opposite who have a fair bit of influence with the Western Australian government, I am told. Those are the people who ought to be out there demanding that the Western Australian government put up their share of the money so that Western Australia can participate fully in the national action plan and not have their works discounted by two-thirds because of the lack of commitment by Western Australia to this important program.</DOC>

 - I certainly take with a pinch of salt the documentation or the views that the member for Lilley has. The only people that are misleading the House here, quite frankly, are from the Australian Labor Party. - It is the opposition in their attitude towards people on disability support pensions who are being totally hypocritical when it comes to the reforms that were first advocated by the McClure report and that we are instigating. The important point to emphasise here is that, with these measures of reforms, we are giving those people who have a disability an opportunity to participate back in the work force -  - through adequate training and rehabilitation, whether that is through being referred on by our personal support providers, through the Job Network or through the 73,000 places -  - which are in the budget that we will be planning for over the next couple of years. The attitude being taken by the opposition is quite breathtaking because they have actually failed to provide any leadership or any real policies to assist this group of Australians which is growing at an increasing rate - there are over 650,000 now; more than the number receiving unemployment payments - or to provide them with an opportunity to participate back in the work force. The changes that we are proposing, particularly the extra assistance that we are putting through the Commonwealth state disability agreement - which we expect all the Australian Labor parties to sign up to as well - along with the employment assistance bill, will provide a far greater range of opportunities for people with disabilities than ever before. The challenge for the Australian Labor Party is to support our legislation. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong. It is a very serious question, and one which I am prepared to give a full answer on to the parliament. It is interesting to take on the issue that has just been raised by the member Lilley. I assure the House and all disability support pensioners who, under the budget measures that have been announced by the government, will be coming into employment services that it has obviously missed the attention of those opposite that intensive support customised assistance - the maximum assistance that can be provided by the Commonwealth to these people - are uncapped places. It does not matter how many people who were formerly disability support pensioners come into this system; we will accommodate them. There will be no virtual waiting rooms, unlike under Labor where people were parked outside for years. That does not occur under Job Network 3, so perhaps another reading of the budget papers by those opposite would be advantageous.There are a number of very significant issues coming out in ESC3, which is the next contract round for Job Network. It is called an active participation model because we know activity equals outcomes and outcomes equal jobs. We will be ensuring that Job Network members have greater engagement with the unemployed person. We will be providing a guarantee of service to the unemployed. We will also have the job seeker account, which will allow a great deal of flexibility between the Job Network member and the genuine job seekers of this country.I am also asked about those who are not genuine about unemployment. I released two attitudinal studies last week, which are available on the web site, of 3,500 surveys of unemployed people -  -  - `It is a disgrace,' I hear the member for Melbourne sing out across the chamber. - The Leader of the Opposition also calls it a disgrace. I will tell you what a disgrace is. A disgrace is what was identified in this report, and that is that one in six - 16 per cent - of Australia's current unemployment recipients, those receiving financial support at taxpayers' expense, described themselves as cruisers. Perhaps some of those opposite would describe themselves also as cruisers, people who are comfortable in their roles without actually being too engaged with what they are doing. On this side, we are identified more as the drivers of employment -  - people who are prepared to work hard and work hard for the unemployed in developing policy -  - rather than the vacuum that appears opposite as far policy is concerned.  - The carping you hear opposite is quite strange when you consider some of the support that I and the government gained when we put this information into the public arena. There has been a great deal of support from a wide variety of people, including some unemployed people who, on talkback radio, have identified that they know many such people. But one comment has come out which has surprised many, a comment that is somewhat inflammatory: someone referring to these people as `scum that need to be weeded out'. It was not anybody on this side. It certainly was not the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations; he would not make such comments. It was, in fact, the member for Lilley who called these people `scum'. How does that fit with what the Leader of the Opposition is now saying and what the member for Melbourne is saying? -  - So that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to quote from the Australian of Tuesday, 21 May. `Rorters are scum, says ALP' is the headline. The article reads:Labor's family and community services spokesman Wayne Swan said people who rorted the welfare system were 'scum and they need to be weeded out'.It is great to see a champion of the cause, of what the coalition has been trying to do for six years, without the support of those opposite. You are condemned by your collective comments during the answer to this question.I am also asked about alternative policy. Unfortunately, there is no alternative policy from the Leader of the Opposition. He has given himself 1,000 days to sort out the mess that is the Labor Party; perhaps at the end of those thousand days - and a few RDOs and all the other activities that the union 60-40 rule allows - he will get around to supporting a decent employment policy which accommodates those people who are coming off DSP and gives them a fair go, as the Howard government has been doing for six years.</DOC>

 - Last time the member for Fraser cited legal advice -  - Last time the member for Fraser cited legal advice as to the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to insurance, I wrote to the member for Fraser and asked him if I could have a copy of that legal advice. - The member for Fraser sent me a copy of his legal advice. He did ask me not to disclose it - which I am happy not to do - but I will quote from that legal advice. It says the following: -  - You do not object? I am happy to table it - would you like me to table the legal advice? - I will table the advice from the member for Fraser. - Just the advice, not the source. - One provision in the advice says this:Basically, the Commonwealth cannot use section 51(xiv) of the Constitution in relation to this matter.That is the insurance power. The legal advice that he sent to me in fact contradicts his very question about whether the Commonwealth has power in relation to this matter.The second thing is this: Senator Helen Coonan, together with the states, has been working hard on coming up with solutions in relation to public liability. There is a key point: there was a Senate inquiry into public liability insurance and there was no submission from the Commonwealth parliamentary Labor Party. If they are really interested in public liability, where are their suggestions?There is a suggestion that has come from the finance minister in Victoria, and I am happy to table this release as well. He announced yesterday that Victoria is going to provide coverage to 12,000 community groups. In the spirit of bipartisanship in supporting a resolution to this matter, we welcome the efforts of the states to move on public liability insurance. We will provide whatever support we can, within the context of the powers that we have - the very powers that the member for Fraser has damned with his own legal advice.The summit convened by Senator Coonan on Thursday will work towards further solutions in public liability. It is a very difficult issue, but there is action happening on short-, medium- and long-term solutions, and we will continue to work towards a resolution that gets Australia's community groups, small business and tourism operators back on track.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his interest in small business. As a former small-business person he would understand the many challenges that small businesses face in dealing with the complexity of the modern economy and, in order to make a buck, in attempting to meet the demands of their customers. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, has its national small business summit this week. The Prime Minister addressed it last night and was very well received, I understand. The Prime Minister reminded the small business community of how important it is to maintain steady hands on the economic levers of the country, how important it is to maintain the low interest rate environment, how important it is to keep the budget in surplus, how important it is to keep inflation low and how important it is to drive economic growth. The Prime Minister also reminded the members of COSBOA how important it is to try to exempt small businesses from the impact of the unfair dismissal laws created by the Labor Party. I addressed the small business summit this morning. I was asked a number of questions, but there was one question I could not answer and it was this. The question was: why is the Labor Party determined to oppose relief for small business in relation to unfair dismissal laws?  -  - We have got one volunteer on this side and now there are two; we have a few volunteers with answers. But there was a second question as well: why was the Labor Party opposing the Commonwealth government's proposal to give the ACCC power to protect small businesses who are the innocent victims of secondary boycotts? So there were two questions in relation to workplace relations and commerce where small business is involved, and the Labor Party has put the interests of the trade union movement ahead of the interests of small businesses. It is a little hard to understand. The Leader of the Opposition said, when he first became Leader of the Opposition just a few months ago, that he was turning over a new leaf. He said, `We in the Labor Party now want to listen to small business; we want to take notice of small business,' and then on the two occasions when he has been put to the test the Leader of the Opposition has now voted for the unions ahead of the interests of Australia's small businesses.Government member - He's looking after his shareholders. - It might have something to do with his shareholders. It might have something to do with the 60-40 rule or the 50-50 rule or whatever the case is, but the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, Kim Beazley, said it in August 2000, when he summarised it beautifully, and these words should be etched in concrete. He said on 6PR, `We, the Labor Party, have never pretended to be a party for small business.' How true it is. It is very hard to be a party for small business when it is a party for the union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question about this important issue. This is something which the government has in hand. It is a matter which is being currently addressed by Senator Coonan in relation to her responsibilities and also being addressed by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson. The government has put in place provisions which ensure the situation of doctors throughout Australia so far as, in their case, their provisions to the end of June this year, and for beyond that further negotiations are going on. That includes a proper assessment of the situation of UMP vis-a-vis the investigations of the provisional liquidator. When those matters are fully ascertained, further announcements will be made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan and take the opportunity to also congratulate him on his very well based citizenship ceremony that he conducted last Saturday in his electorate and the way in which he involved local community groups in a very effective way. - Unlike those members opposite, the member for Ryan and all those on this side take very seriously the importance of Australian citizenship and, for that matter, the fact that ceremonies should be conducted in a very non-political environment. The member has asked about some very important landmark research which I revealed last week - and it certainly does apply to his electorate, mine and many others - and which shows just how successful Australia's high migrant population has become, particularly the second generation migrants: people who have gone through the system legally and have contributed enormously to our nation-building exercise.In 1996, there were 3.4 million second generation migrants. That is about 20 per cent of the total population. The study shows migrants who came from Asian, eastern European and southern European extraction to Australia in the postwar period have in fact been particularly successful members of the Australian family. In fact, this study has shown that this particular group have gone on to achieve some better educational and occupational outcomes than many - of those opposite, I was going to say - of those with an Australian born parent.There should never be any resentment about success people achieve for themselves. In fact, I believe that much of the effort the parents who brought their children to Australia - or brought themselves to Australia to then have children - showed has in fact rubbed off on their kids. There is some determination to in fact achieve something for their parents, and they achieve well for themselves and indeed for the entire nation. They are a highly motivated group who really want to show that what their parents went through is something they respect. I think they should be encouraged and emphasised.This government has an emphasis on migrants coming to Australia from a non-English speaking background learning English. There might be some 170 different languages spoken by various people around this country on occasions but it is English that is the language which all cultures and all backgrounds use to speak to each other. Our Adult Migrant English Program is a very professional organisation. Unlike countries like Great Britain, where one million people do not speak English, this government is determined to ensure that people have their best set of opportunities to learn the language of this country. In fact, even the British government are consulting with us over our approaches to settlement. - A lot of things, Prime Minister? At the end of the day, the British government are wanting to learn from our example and what we have managed to achieve. With citizenship as the cornerstone of our very inclusive but culturally diverse society, the government will be continuing to be committed to promoting Australian values - very much so - as part of the good settlement outcomes here in Australia. We want to back the individuals who come to Australia with a determination to succeed. We want to ensure that the second generation actually achieve something as well. The figures that have been released show very simply that services such as the Translating and Interpreting Service, migrant resource centres, the Community Settlement Services Scheme and the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy services are all assisting in that aim. This means more jobs for more Australians with better qualifications. </DOC>

 - I definitely did not make that remark, notwithstanding the efforts of one interviewer to imply that I had done so. Every time that that question was asked of me I made the point that any reference I made to the various revenues available to the state governments would only be considered in the light of any future recommendations of a standing committee of this parliament, of which Labor have some frontbench members. - That is exactly what I said: those agreements would not be anything for me to consider. In fact, I made it very clear that that was not the case. You can laugh and giggle - you were not there; I was and there were other witnesses. While we are on this issue, isn't it amazing that I have been pointing out the inefficiencies of local policing, local health services and local education and what gets published in the Sydney Morning Herald about that great speech made by the Leader of the Opposition and his plea to the Labor Party in New South Wales, when he was taken downstairs for a little lesson in obedience? What did he do? - No, Mr Speaker, this is seriously relevant, because in his speech he talked about exactly these issues.  - In announcing the government's policy to have an inquiry into the cost-shifting between state and local government, I personally requested one of the higher-ranking standing committees of this parliament to look into the matter. As I have already said, that committee includes senior members of the Labor Party frontbench. I made it very clear at that interview that that was the basis of the answer, and any future reference only required that recommendations regarding the expenditure be expenditure neutral. That is what has been said, and I made it very clear - as one would think the Leader of the Opposition would be aware - that the process of a standing committee involves evidence. That is legion when it comes to kids being able to buy drugs on Cabramatta railway station, which might be stopped in that regard. The other fact of life is -  -  - We've just had the lily gilded. - Not completely, but almost. This inquiry has been endorsed by the economics committee. It will proceed and the government will take note of the recommendations in due course. - It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition has already said publicly that he wants to do the same thing by way of a partnership - it is in black and white. The fact of life is that this is a good idea for this parliament -  - The member for Ballarat giggles. Ring up your own local authorities and ask them whether they want help of this nature. Of course they do. The people of Ballarat are fed up with having to hire their own doctors -  - The people of Ballarat do not get an adequate local policing service, and their newly elected member thinks it is a joke. We do not, and if the Leader of the Opposition - old laughing Simon -  - believes that that is all he is good for, I am very sorry for him and his future.</DOC>

 - I would be very happy to do that, but before I do I would like to associate the government with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition at the commencement of question time regarding the news of the serious illness of Sandy Bodecker, Cathy Freeman's husband. Anybody who faces that challenge deserves the understanding and sympathy of the parliament, and I know that all Australians will feel for Cathy and the rest of her family at this time.Today's meeting between myself and the Prime Minister of Thailand and senior ministers from both governments and also the gathering in the Great Hall emphasised the strength of a very important bilateral relationship that Australia has. The people of Thailand and the people of Australia have quite a long history, and there are many important and interesting aspects of that relationship. Out of today's meeting came a number of quite specific and tangible agreements. We have agreed to negotiate a closer economic relations, or CER, agreement. I have described that as being an FTA-plus agreement on which we have decided to negotiate. As an earnest of the determination of the governments to get on with the job, I can inform the House that tomorrow in Mexico, at the margins of an APEC trade ministers meeting, the Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, and his Thai counterpart will commence the negotiations. So the announcement is made today and tomorrow the negotiations by the two trade ministers from Australia and Thailand will start in earnest.This is, as I have said, an FTA-plus. Therefore, progress in some areas, such as visas and mutual recognition, could well be made in coming months as the agreement will be comprehensive in scope. Key tariff liberalisation issues will be considered as a package. As in all FTA negotiations, it is realistic to expect that negotiations will move more quickly in some areas than in others.In addition to the arrangements regarding a closer economic relationship, we have agreed in principle to negotiate a bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism. We have also agreed to investigate whether we cannot act jointly to provide crop substitution programs in Burma to suppress narcotics, and this is a goal that I know members on both sides of the House will share. There are details - and there are difficulties - in relation to ensuring that the goal is fully achieved and the resources are properly applied but, if those conditions can be met, there is no reason why we should not be involved - if that can make a contribution towards the suppression of narcotics coming out of Burma. Bearing in mind that something like 80 per cent of heroin and other drugs that come into this country come out of that part of the world, Australia, more than most nations, has a vital and ongoing human interest in ensuring that progress is made in this area.We also agreed, importantly, to explore whether it was possible to establish a working holiday visa understanding between Australia and Thailand. Once again, safeguards will be required on both sides and proper conditions established, but this would in particular give a very significant spur to exchanges between our two communities amongst young people. I think if that agreement can be consummated it will add to the strength of the bilateral relationship.Australia recently passed the United States to become the principal destination of Thai students going overseas for their education, and that is another example of the importance and the growing strength of the relationship. I want to say, on behalf of the government and I know on behalf of the opposition on this occasion, the Prime Minister of Thailand is a very welcome visitor to our country. It is an important relationship, and I think as a result of today's visit the relationship is better and stronger and we have laid out a road map to build in a number of very practical and very important areas.</DOC>

 - The honourable gentleman professes a concern about reassuring doctors. Let me say on that point that, given the steps that have been taken by the government thus far, there is no reason for doctors to stop practising as a result of what has happened to UMP-AML. I will be having, on behalf of the government, more to say on this issue in the next day or so and, as has been the case with past statements, what will be said will be constructive; it will be to the benefit of the community as well as to the benefit of the doctors. This is a difficult issue. It is not an issue that has been generated by governments. - It is an issue that requires the cooperative response of both state and federal governments, and it is receiving that. I believe that what has been done so far has been fair and balanced. I believe what will be said in the future will be equally fair and balanced and will provide proper reassurance to doctors. It may not meet all of their expectations, but you can never meet all of the expectations of everybody on something like this. We have obligations to the community. We have obligations to the medical profession. I have said before that one of the things that is needed -  - The community embraces all patients. That was a dramatic interjection. The reality is that this is an issue which is in part a product of the litigation disease which is rampant in the Australian community. Just as public liability insurance is in great difficulty because of the litigation disease, the same applies in relation to medical indemnity insurance. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot expect to have doctors available in every part of the Australian community providing all of the specialties on demand - virtually - but then complain if there are some restrictions put on the right of people to sue. Something has to give. You simply cannot have a situation in this country where both of those aspirations are met. What we have to do as a community is to work it out.I want obstetricians in every rural area of Australia where it is reasonable for the Australians living in those areas to have them. They can only be there if they can afford to pay the premiums and they cannot afford to pay the premiums if we continue to be afflicted by the litigation disease. What is happening at the moment is that an attempt is being made by this government, in partnership with the medical profession and with the state governments, to work out a solution. - Instead of the sort of nitpicking I have just heard from the member for Perth, he ought to make a few sensible and constructive suggestions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform the House that the capital expenditure, or CAPEX, survey which came out today showed that new capital expenditure fell 3.2 per cent in the March quarter. However, that was after an exceptionally strong December quarter rise of 7.2 per cent, and over the course of the 12 months to the end of the March quarter capital expenditure has risen by a solid four per cent.Also with that survey is the expectation survey for the forthcoming financial year, 2002-03. The second estimate for capital expenditure in the forthcoming financial year is 16.2 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate in the current financial year of 2001-02, which shows that business have very high expectations indeed as to what their capital expenditure will be in the forthcoming year. The budget forecast a 12 per cent increase in business investment in the forthcoming financial year and that is consistent with the expectations that we saw for capital expenditure.The member for Hinkler would be familiar with some of the very large projects now commencing in relation to investment: Comalco up at Gladstone, which I know you are very interested in; the magnesium corporation near Rockhampton; the Western Sydney Orbital; the Scoresby Freeway; the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line; and in Western Australia the fourth train of LNG at the North West Shelf. This is a very strong investment climate.The retail trade figures also came out today and they showed that retail trade increased by 0.9 per cent in April and increased by 7.5 per cent through the year to April. These are very buoyant retail trade figures. What they reflect is a great deal of consumer confidence. The fastest growing area in relation to retail trade was household goods, which have grown by 15.1 per cent over the year, no doubt fuelled by the housing cycle. As that comes off a bit you would expect that to come back a bit. But consumer spending has been underpinned by high confidence, low interest rates, tax cuts and solid employment growth.Australia is forecast by the Economist to be the fastest growing of the industrialised countries in both this year and in next year. Consumer confidence is very high, as is business confidence. The Australian public, I believe, will welcome the strong business investment figures and intentions and indeed the strong consumer sentiment reflected in today's retail trade figures.</DOC>

 - First, I take the opportunity to thank the member for Paterson - who is an outstanding member - for his question, and to particularly acknowledge the very strong and vocal opposition that he takes to illegal immigration. He has been stalwart in standing up for Australia's border protection.In answer to the honourable member's question, this morning I had a useful discussion with Justice Bhagwati, who is the personal envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. When I was in Geneva some months ago, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, asked if she could send a representative to Australia to look at the detention centre at Woomera. The government agreed that Justice Bhagwati could come, and he is indeed here at the moment. I took the opportunity of having a very civil and constructive conversation with Justice Bhagwati, underlining that Australia made no apologies for the stance it has adopted to stop people smugglers profiting from sending people illegally to Australia. I also told Justice Bhagwati that this is a policy that is working and we have no intention of changing our policy. It was a good opportunity for the two of us to exchange a wide range of views. I took the opportunity of telling the judge that there were around 700 unauthorised boat arrivals currently in detention on the mainland in Australia and that, of these, 352 have had their claims rejected and have exhausted all legal avenues of appeal and are awaiting removal. I also told him that another 220 have had their claims rejected and are awaiting judicial review. I think this perspective is not always put strongly enough by those who are critics of the government. - Mr Speaker, it is amusing how you always get interjections on this issue from the deeply divided opposition; it is deeply divided on this issue. I told the judge that only 53 applicants are awaiting a primary decision and that the delay in finalising their claims is often due to a lack of documentation and character and security clearances. In an overall sense, I think it is important that the United Nations and its institutions work closely with an advanced liberal democracy like Australia - the world's sixth oldest continuously operating democracy - and it is important that the United Nations examine the facts very carefully when they look into issues like this, rather than just listen to the howling of the political critics of the government or people who are pushing a particular political barrow.That is a point I made to Justice Bhagwati: that it is very important to understand the perspective of people who are criticising the government within Australia and rushing off to talk and write letters to Mary Robinson in an endeavour to criticise the Australian government. Indeed, amongst those more prominent critics of the government on the issue of detaining illegal migrants are Labor Party candidates, Labor Party members and the New South Wales division of the Australian Labor Party. A Labor Party candidate at the last election, who I believe lives in my own electorate in South Australia, Jeremy Moore, is one of the prominent critics of the government's policy on this issue.The honourable member for Paterson asked whether there are any alternative policies. Of course, this is the whole point: on this side of the House we have one clear, strong and principled position on this issue, and on the other side of the House they are deeply divided. A Leader of the Opposition who claimed a few weeks ago that he had heard no-one arguing against mandatory detention then ends up having the whole of the New South Wales division of the Labor Party come out and oppose it. It will be interesting to see what happens this weekend at the Queensland conference. On a very important issue for this country, it is the case that the Australian Labor Party is deeply divided. It has no policy -  - It is not rubbish. It says that one day it will come up with a policy - but when will that day be? If it is such an important issue, why does the Labor Party have no official policy? The answer is perfectly clear: because it is deeply divided.</DOC>

 - Clearly, I was able to hear the question. I was sitting a little further away than you are. Can I congratulate this constituent on the fact that he is actually applying for jobs. Isn't it great that in Newcastle there are 75 jobs that he can apply for? Under the Labor Party and under your leader when he was the employment minister, there would not have been 75 opportunities. There would not have been 75 jobs in Newcastle. There would not have been a range of opportunities provided by the Job Network. I wonder how it would have been handled when Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition, was the employment minister? Would this gentlemen have had the chance of applying or would he have been thrown on the waste heap, in the wastepaper basket, of disability support pension? I have here a graph of those people that entered disability support pension under the stewardship of the then employment minister, now the Leader of the Opposition. These people, under the last three years of Labor, had an increase of 22.8 per cent in disability support pensions. - I can understand the sensitivity of a range of former employment ministers who failed the Australian people when there were over one million Australians unemployed. I simply draw to the attention of the House the opportunities that are there now under an improved Job Network, compared to an old CES that failed people, and also the failure of this person here who was then the employment minister who threw people onto the disability support pension at twice the rate that they are currently finding themselves disabled. Either they were sick of the Labor Party, they were sick of you, or they were just not given any opportunities. - In conclusion, I just want to reassure the gentleman referred to that the Job Network is there to help, that not only is it helping Australians but we are also getting more people into work than the failed system that preceded it. I understand there is a dilemma in the opposition at the moment because we have those who refer to these people as `scum', and we have got others that talk about us vilifying them. - Can I assure those opposite that this government continues to be committed and will always remain committed to Australia's unemployed. Today unemployment is at 6.3 per cent - not 11 per cent - and going down.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I note that the member for Page is a former member of the Australian Workers Union in the days when unions better represented real working Australians. As Neville Wran put it in his legendary Town Hall mugging of the Leader of the Opposition last weekend:This party is a creation of the trade unions. ... They are untouchable. ... No trade unions, no Labor Party.That is what he said. The Siamese twin relationship between the ACTU and the ALP is really quite simple: the unions fund the party, the unions man the party and the unions run the party. For instance, the Miscellaneous Workers Union has given $3,073,000 to the Labor Party over the past six years and, according to the Register of Members' Interests, caucus representatives of the Miscellaneous Workers Union included the member for Lyons, the member for Batman, the member for Reid, the member for Bendigo, the member for Scullin, the member for Capricornia, the member for Fraser, the member for Bass and the member for Hasluck - and that is just in one house of this parliament. In the Senate, the Miscellaneous Workers Union is represented by Senator Bolkus, Senator Faulkner, Senator Gibbs, Senator Chris Evans and Senator O'Brien.  - I think that point of order from the distinguished former president of the New South Wales Labor Council, and a very long-time union official, rather proves my point. I am sure the `missos' are a fine old union, but it is hard to see why 131,000 miscellaneous workers deserve to have 14 members of parliament. It is hard to see why the Miscellaneous Workers Union should have almost as many members of parliament as the sovereign state of Tasmania. There may well be more. More than 40 caucus members have neglected to declare their affiliation on the Register of Members' Interests, even though party rules say that every single member must be a member of a union. The last time 60 per cent of the Australian work force were union members was in 1953. The last time 50 per cent of the Australian work force were union members was in 1976. So in moving from 60-40 to 50-50, the Leader of the Opposition is making the great leap forward to 1976. As well as deepening his voice, I expect the Leader of the Opposition is -  - going to swan in here wearing flares, wide ties, sideburns and humming Hotel California. I do not know who is going to mug the Leader of the Opposition this week on his way up to Brisbane but, if the Leader of the Opposition wanted to prove that he had any leadership capacity at all, he would go up to big Bill Ludwig this weekend, he would grab him by the scruff of the neck and he would say, `Bill, you and the boys are dinosaurs, and you can't treat the Labor Party -  - like your Jurassic Park playpen any more.'</DOC>

 - It is good to see the opposition finally starting to show some interest in employment services. - What is quite clear by Mission Australia - and I take it you have no issue with organisations with the reputation of Mission Australia -  - My apologies, Mr Speaker. I take it the opposition has no issue with organisations such as those of the quality of Mission Australia and Centrecare providing incentives to employers. After all, if I am not mistaken, the great champions of wage subsidies, and financial inducements to wage subsidies, which cost $184,000 per net outcome under your stewardship, hardly compares to a set of golf clubs, if that is what it takes to get someone a job.  -  - The point I would like to make is that everything that Mission Australia is currently undertaking is for one purpose and one purpose only - that is, to ensure that there are more job opportunities for Australians. If those opposite have an argument with that - the fact that we are now producing more outcomes through the Job Network than the CES ever dreamt of, at less than a third of the cost; that we have taken into account many of the things that have been put into the Productivity Commission's interim report; that there are some organisations out there offering targeted job subsidies; that we refuse to see money thrown away in the wanton manner in which taxpayers' money was abused when your leader was then the employment minister - we make no excuse for a system which actually targets assistance at those who need it, creates opportunities and creates real jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I congratulate him on his efforts since his election in ensuring that ample funding -  - particularly under the Howard government's sustainable regions program was available to his electorate. This particular program is targeted not only at remote areas but those on the periphery of large cities, such as the electorate of Macarthur where, in fact, there is considerable need for government assistance of a proactive nature.In yesterday's adjournment debate, recorded on page 2483 of Hansard, the member for Werriwa raised this grant and referred to the Campbelltown-Camden Sustainable Region Advisory Committee as `another useless talkfest and bureaucratic report into unemployment in Campbelltown'. I am sure the three members of that particular advisory committee, including the Labor Mayor of Camden, Mr Geoff Corrigan, would be very grateful for his view of their commitment. Furthermore, notwithstanding his association with the member for Werriwa, we note that he indicates in the Macarthur Chronicle - which the member for Werriwa also reads, because he referred to it - that he will put his hat in the ring for state Labor preselection. One can only expect that he is either in the wrong union or otherwise the member for Werriwa does not understand the workings of these advisory committees. As their name suggests, they are advisory to the government on how this funding of $12 million for a depressed region may be expended. But what is more, their efforts are not funded from that $12 million - only two accept remuneration. Their efforts are funded independently and separately by department budgets, so the full $12 million will be going. Furthermore, instead of coming in and maligning people who give voluntarily of their time to assist others in their region -  - had the member for Werriwa bothered to go to the web site, in reference to his injudicious remarks, it is quoted there that the local advisory committees will help develop a forward plan for the Campbelltown-Camden region and identify development priorities. - It will administer funding applications for projects that meet locally identified priorities. These might include: minor infrastructure, skills building, encouraging and assisting small business and addressing social development and environmental issues. If that is a talkfest, I do not know what is. That looks like hard work and it was supported the other day by between 100 and 150 people attending at the Campbelltown RSL for the purpose of advising this committee on what they, the people of the district, thought might be useful. - But there are other things that the member for Werriwa might acquaint himself with, because further in his speech he suggested that some of this money might go to the Brooks Road connection with the M5. I am a Western Australian - I do not know too much about the geography of New South Wales - but I think the bloke who lived next door to a road should know it is not the M5, it is the F5. The M5, in fact, is a road between Liverpool and Sydney. The local member can chuck mud at local people doing a good job when he does not even know the name of his local roads. Further and finally, as this committee brings its recommendations forward, they should be aware, in terms of the Brooks Road entry to the F5 - which the member promotes - that this government has a similar view, that that would be an excellent point of connection to the F5.The New South Wales government does not think that and I am wondering whether the Leader of the Opposition was also told to tell the member for Werriwa to show proper obedience and stick with what the state Labor government wants, which is twofold: they want the connection in a place the member for Werriwa does not want and they think we should pay for all of it. I think the member for Werriwa should apologise to the hardworking people who volunteered for that advisory committee and not make reference to them in the fashion that he has, and which, by interjection, he has supported today. He is not even sorry.</DOC>

 - Maybe a little trip down memory lane, when it comes to unemployment, would refresh your memory of your failing of the Australian people. Today, unemployment is at 6.3 per cent across the country; it was 8.2 per cent when this government came to power. - In March of 1996, long-term unemployment was 198,000 - a growth of around 89 per cent over the six years, from 1990 to 1996. You have to ask yourself: what chance would this gentleman have had, if any, if he had been unemployed in that period? The other sad reality is, unfortunately under a Queensland Beattie-led Labor government, we are unable to meet the benchmark that the Howard government has set across the country and, in fact, has the highest unemployment level of all mainland Australian states. - That is from a Premier who has claimed five per cent. But to your gentleman can I say that under the CES he would have had 300 sites on which to gain access anywhere in Australia. Today there are some 2,000 sites. There is great innovation in the Job Network, whereas under the Labor Party he would have been subject to one training course after another, sitting in a room, probably basket weaving, with no relevance whatsoever to his own IT aspirations. Today there can be specific targeted resources placed to him. What I must ask the Leader of the Opposition and the member who asked the question is: if you want to deny people opportunities, continue to do what you are doing now - that is, to say, as people did in this place one after another last night, that there are Australians out there who are not doing the right thing, and you have a spokesman who wants -  - My apologies, Mr Speaker. To make it amply clear: you have a spokesman in the form of the family services shadow minister who is referring to unemployed people as scum. What we are saying -  - I simply highlight the point that we will continue to work for the gentleman that you referred to -  - The Job Network is delivering a more individualised, more targeted level of service than any employment services in the history of this country and it is now recognised by the OECD as a leading employment services regime in the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his concern for, and commitment to, maturing members of his community and in particular in relation to information and communication technologies. All federal governments and their budgets lay foundation stones for the future of a country. This year, the Treasurer has released the Intergenerational Report and there are also measures which effectively change the lives of human beings. One of those, for which the member for Moncrieff among many others was an advocate, was a $23.2 million program to bring basic computer skills and computer information to 46,000 Australians who are looking for a job and who have never learned how to use a computer. This program will link those Australians to other Australians who are already proficient in the use of information technologies.We need to ask ourselves how we would feel if we lived in a country where everybody was talking about emails and the Internet on a day-to-day basis, and about information communication technology, yet you did not even know how to turn a computer on. People like Kay Binet, a lady in her early sixties in Hobart, who told the Australian in June 2000 under a heading that read -  -  - In June 2000, the Australian ran a headline referring to `lost souls' and one of the people referred to as being amongst the lost souls was a woman in her early sixties called Kay Binet. She said:I find it a bit embarrassing because I am so dumb -  not being able to use a computer. This program aims not only to connect the Kay Binets in Australia to the rest of the country, but also to new and emerging -  - I am inviting honourable members to reflect on a statement from an Australian which says, `I find it's a bit embarrassing because I am so dumb because I am not able to use a computer.' As I have said, imagine living in a society where, on a day-to-day basis, we talk about the Internet, emails and connectedness and you are part of a country where you do not have the basic ability to use a computer. As an editorial in the Hobart Mercury said two days ago:Literacy is the key to unleashing ... human potential, to overcoming humiliation and underemployment and empowering people to live richer and more satisfying lives.And the same can certainly be said for computer literacy. I am asked about other policies and comments and I must say that I was staggered when I opened the Australian newspaper on 21 May 2002. Under the headline, `Budget skill fund is a 'joke'':Dimension Data Learning Services general manager Steve Ross said ... the mature-age training program was a waste of money. `These are people who don't like computers - this won't make any difference because they are cyber-phobic,' he said. `They have been left behind on purpose because the don't like computers.'As denigrating and humiliating as those remarks would be to the Kay Binets and other Australians who are not yet able to turn on a computer, you would have to ask yourself what kind of person, what kind of organisation, could endorse and give currency to such demeaning remarks? I suspect that the member for Braddon is sitting there asking himself the same question. The member for Port Adelaide would be asking himself who on earth would be so offensive to people who are not yet computer literate. The member for Lyons, perhaps better than anybody else in this House, knows what it is like to not be able to be literate in fundamental skills. The member for Hotham, the Leader of the Opposition, knows who would endorse such remarks; he knows what organisation would not only endorse but disseminate such remarks, and it is Senator Kate Lundy on behalf of the Australian Labor Party! On 20 May, attached to the budget press release from Senator Lundy were the offensive remarks of Mr Ross, repeated verbatim and widely disseminated throughout the community.The Leader of the Opposition told Liam Bartlett on 9 March this year that the opposition would be judged by the things for which it stood, not the things which it opposed. I invite the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party to reflect on this: last week on behalf of the government I announced a $130 million national centre for excellence in information and communication technology at the former Eveleigh railway yards in Sydney. Information and communication technology are the railway lines for the 21st century. But what the Labor Party is saying is that the `no ticket, no start' dictum will apply to a section of Australia where they will say: `We will not even give you a ticket. You will not even be allowed to get on the train. The train for information and communication technology is going to pull out and it is going to leave you behind.' I say to the Leader of the Opposition - and the other sneering, laughing members of the ALP behind him -  - you should remember that on a day-to-day basis when you sit there behind your laptop in question time online to Sharan Burrow -  - that it is the hard work and taxes of everyday Australians that are funding the provision of information technology services to you. - Mr Speaker, in concluding, this is the worst and most offensive form of intellectual elitism that I have experienced for a considerable time. The Leader of the Opposition -  - should dissociate the Australian Labor Party from these remarks today and discipline Senator Lundy and make sure there are some things that are worthy of support in this parliament by all members of parliament. If the Labor Party is not prepared to support 46,000 Australians in learning how to turn on a computer, to word process, use the Internet and receive and send an email, then you are not worthy to be here.</DOC>

 - I have been asked for my view on maternity leave in the past and I will restate it, which is that I think those employers who are able to pay for maternity leave give a very valuable service to employees. It is available in big business, it is available in the public sector, and it is of great advantage to those that are able to benefit from it. My concern is, and always has been, for small business. If a small business running close to the line on profitability were in a position where it was obliged to pay two wages for one position it would find that a very significant cost. At the end of the day, it would affect profitability and it would affect employment. That is why the government and big business have been able to do it, because they have the resources, and it is why you do not find it prevalent in small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question on this 10th anniversary of the High Court's historic decision in Mabo and note the member's interest in these matters, knowing that he represents Kurnell in Sydney and has been associated with many significant events that acknowledge the importance of the indigenous involvement with that part of Sydney. Of course, like the 1967 referendum, the Mabo decision was a turning point in relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It rewrote our property law, it recognised indigenous rights to land as part of our common law, but, without a statutory reinforcement in the form of native title, the potential for Mabo could have been quite quickly eroded. Parliament enacted the Native Title Act in response to that decision, and in 1998 significant amendments to that original legislation were enacted to reflect developments in the law, particularly as a result of the Wik decision. In 1998, those amendments paved the way for greater certainty and improved workability of the native title process. The steps that we took then are now bearing fruit. As at 29 May, there have been 41 determinations of native title across Australia. In addition, there have been 48 indigenous land use agreements that have been registered with a further 24, as I understand it, in the pipeline at this time. As well, we have seen some 2,700 agreements with developers and native title parties relating to future development activity. Prior to 1998, progress was painstakingly slow. There had only been three determinations in a period of four years. So we have shifted the focus away from litigation to negotiation and agreement, which would not have been possible without those 1998 amendments. And, of course, combined with land purchases and the various statutory rights schemes, over 15 per cent of Australia and almost half of the Northern Territory is now owned or controlled by indigenous people. A further involvement has been with the Indigenous Land Corporation, which receives some $50 million per year for land acquisition and management. Of course the more important question which all of us ought to focus on is why, as a result of all these significant changes, we have not seen, in relation to those who have acquired interest in land, significant changes in their situation and circumstances. I think, as a number of leading articles have said over the weekend, there is a need for an effort to ensure that landownership adds to the social and economic wellbeing of indigenous people. I can assure you that the Commonwealth is committed to reviewing particularly the 1977 Northern Territory land rights act which has been successful in returning land. That has been primarily useful in relation to spiritual and cultural issues in protecting sacred sites and has been far less successful in providing any other form of benefits. I hope that there will be ready cooperation in relation to securing negotiated outcomes that can be helpful. But the more important aspect has been the government's approach to obtaining better social and economic outcomes from indigenous land as well as our generous and general policies for indigenous affairs. We are committed to improving health, employment, education and housing, as well as infrastructure, and we have provided very significant additional funds - some $327 million - to tackle welfare dependency, as well as improving housing, health and resources to streamline the native title system. An increase of $67 million for indigenous affairs in the last budget, which was announced previously, brings something of the order of $2.5 billion worth of expenditure for indigenous specific programs and services. We are taking an innovative approach to these issues and that has been acknowledged. I note particularly some comments of Noel Pearson, where he said the so-called `rights agenda' had, I think, little to offer in comparison to new policy directions. He noted that Labor had not evidenced a willingness to change in relation to those matters. He said:... a much more important starting point for any national government is to recognise that substance abuse epidemics are today not merely symptoms of Aboriginal disadvantage ... but self-perpetuating disasters in their own right ...He called for a focus on improving indigenous health and tackling passive welfare, and he acknowledged that this government has taken the first steps in this direction. I noted particularly his complimentary comments of the Leader of the House for committing in his portfolio funds for family income management, particularly in Cape York. He gives far more credit, I think, to the coalition in these matters than he does to my opponent, who has been writing recently.</DOC>

 - I am all in favour of a fair deal for families with children and that is precisely what this government has provided: a very fair deal for families with children. In our first budget, we massively boosted benefits to families with children and, in the Treasurer's outstanding budget just a couple of weeks ago, we implemented the baby bonus, which means that women leaving the work force to have children can receive up to $2,500 a year courtesy of this government's policy. This government is doing the right thing by families with children; it is doing the right thing by the working parents of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform him that the government has put in place a number of steps to encourage share ownership amongst the Australian public. The first thing we did was cut capital gains tax for individuals so that people that buy shares are only taxed at their marginal rate on half of the capital gained. In addition to that, we abolished stamp duty on share transfers, we introduced scrip for scrip rollover relief and, probably the thing that has done more than anything else to encourage Australians to take out shares, we offered Australians the opportunity to take shares in one of Australia's great corporations, the Telstra Corporation.According to the Australian Stock Exchange, around 41 per cent of Australians now have direct share ownership compared to 32 per cent in the United States and 31 per cent in New Zealand. Australia has the highest per capita share ownership in the world. We can say that the one group that has brought that about more than anything else is the first time share investors in Telstra Corporation. In Telstra 1, 560,000 Australians came into the sharemarket for the first time, and the second tranche introduced more than 300,000 first time investors - nearly one million new investors, none of whom would have had the opportunity to own shares for the first time if the Labor Party had been successful. I think there is a general recognition in this House that the current ownership situation with Telstra is untenable. - The member for Melbourne certainly shares that view. - He interjects loudly, no doubt to reinforce his view, as he said on 23 May -  - He always shouts loudest when he knows what is coming. On 23 May 2002, the member for Melbourne said:There is no question that the current situation is seriously inadequate and that we have to address those problems. - `Not about ownership,' he says. - One of the propositions the member for Melbourne puts forward is to strip everything that is valuable out of Telstra and return, with nationalisation, the unprofitable parts to government ownership. In other words, the whole service provision will be privatised and what is left will be given back to government ownership. As Bob Mansfield, the chairman of Telstra, said, as quoted in the Weekend Australian on the weekend:Telstra is not now a business with telegraph poles running wire. It's now a wholly integrated jigsaw puzzle of IT capability. How the hell do you split it and still maintain the scale factor, not only scale factor in Australia, the scale factor to compete globally?The Labor Party, which has apparently discovered economic ownership, now even has a spokesman who is in charge of promoting economic ownership. The first thing that he commits himself to, as part of his spread of economic ownership, is nationalisation in relation to Telstra. That is the first thing he does. He does not have the courage to stand up and take Labor Party policy on in relation to this. So we have the Labor Party on the one hand committing itself to nationalisation and, on the other hand, to asset stripping Telstra as a consequence. All of this is designed to make it acceptable to the people of Parramatta. - The Labor Party's policy on Telstra is closer to Pyongyang than it is to Parramatta. It is one of the last political parties in the world that believes in the nationalisation of telephone companies. In order to maintain the facade that, on the one hand, it wants a nationalised company but, on the other hand, it is forward- and modern-thinking, it has proposed an asset strip in relation to Telstra that would have made Alan Bond proud. We agree with the member for Melbourne and those other speakers on the weekend who said that it is necessary to resolve the ownership in relation to Telstra, but I would recommend to those so-called modern thinkers on the front bench of the Labor Party that they take some of the advice from Mr Mansfield: Telstra is not now a business with telegraph poles running wire; it is now a wholly integrated jigsaw puzzle of IT capability. The sooner the Labor Party recognises that, the better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I recognise the stalwart work that he does in support of the government's policies on people-smuggling. The member for Grey has been unequivocal in his support of protecting Australia's borders. Thailand is one of Australia's closest regional partners, and that applies in the fight against people-smuggling as well as in many other activities. The visit of Thai Prime Minister Thaksin to Australia last week was not only a very great success but it provided an opportunity for the government to discuss people-smuggling issues with Prime Minister Thaksin, as we had done the previous week in Bangkok.Thailand is leading the development of the practical work program agreed at the Bali regional conference, including in areas like information and intelligence sharing, law enforcement, border management and return operations. We particularly congratulate the Thais on the work they are doing as chair of one of the two working groups that were established in Bali. One manifest example of Thailand's cooperation with Australia on people-smuggling is the arrest of the notorious people-smuggler, Hasan Ayoub, with the case for his extradition to Australia currently before the Thai courts. We very much appreciate the assistance that Thailand has been providing. That is in addition to assistance from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia as well. The honourable member for Grey asked whether there are any alternative approaches, and that makes one reflect on the Labor Party, because the Labor Party apparently has an alternative approach. I noticed at the weekend that the Queensland Labor Party state conference passed a motion that supports an end to the current system of detention. I also note that the Leader of the Opposition, who had been booed at the conference the previous day, scurried away and did not stand and defend the case that he apparently argued, that he somehow supports the policy of detention. The situation now is that the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party and the Queensland branch of the Labor Party are both against the policy of detention. The Queensland and New South Wales branches of the Labor Party say that people who come illegally to Australia should be allowed out into the community. The Leader of the Opposition's authority on this issue has twice been overturned by major state conferences. I remind the House that on 6 February, on the Sunrise program, the Leader of the Opposition said:No one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.Have you heard of anyone now, Mr Speaker, who the Leader of the Opposition himself may have heard arguing for the abolition of mandatory detention? Here is a party deeply divided. I have noticed, though, that the member for Lalor, who I think is the spokesperson on immigration, after the Queensland Labor Party conference said:We - that is, the Labor Party - like to do our politics in style and that is the style of state conferences.She then went on to say disingenuously, if ever there were a disingenuous comment:The debate was one about terminology.The same sort of theme came from the member for Rankin, who apparently is the Leader of the Opposition's closest adviser and confidant. I read in the newspapers that some people back there are not very happy about that. However, what the member for Rankin said after the Labor Party rolled the Leader of the Opposition was:What I am encouraged about is the degree of common ground - on this issue. The member for Griffith, who is always a laugh a minute, said:There's a lot of agreement in that room.It is hardly surprising that, sitting quietly up the back there, hardly saying a word other than the occasional point of order, is the member for Brand, just waiting to swoop.</DOC>

 - This is the same Mr Olsen who the Premier of South Australia, Mr Rann, said the other day he would welcome to a diplomatic appointment of this kind. What do you have to say to that? This is not the same Mr Olsen who would get a quarter of a million dollar a year salary. This is the Mr Olsen who will get an annual salary at SES band 2 of the Public Service which, off the top of my head - and I had a look not long ago - is about $126,000 a year. This is the same government that, when it has made political appointments to diplomatic posts, pays people at the rate that public servants would be paid if they were in those jobs. You were members of a government which, when you appointed politicians to diplomatic posts, paid them at the level of secretaries. We changed that policy. Mr Olsen will be paid at an SES band 2.2 level whereas - under Labor - you paid your political appointees at the level of secretary. My last point is that that was a pretty cheap question because Mr Olsen did an enormous amount to contribute to the recovery of the South Australian economy after the devastation of the Bannon years. After the Bannon government put the state into hock, Mr Olsen, along with his predecessor Mr Brown, helped to restore credibility to the South Australian economy and to bring investment and growth to the state. He has done South Australia proud and he will do Australia proud.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question because it gives me an opportunity to assure the House that the government is firmly committed to maintaining the integrity of our borders. Of course, up until now, an important aspect of being able to maintain the integrity of our borders has been to ensure that if people arrive in Australia without authority, they are detained until such time as we are able to deal with a number of matters, particularly their health, character and any potential security risk that may be associated with their presence, to ensure that people are available for processing and to ensure that, if they have no lawful basis to remain in Australia, they are available for removal.That very important public policy has had very strong support in this parliament over a long period and there are very good reasons for that. First, the strategy that we have used has worked. When we see the strategy, it is not just about detention and mandatory detention; it is about working with other countries of first asylum to deal with burden sharing issues. It is about working with transit countries to ensure that people only travel properly documented and with authority, and Operation Relex has also been a very important part of the strategy for dealing with these issues. I can assure the member that there have been very important advances in relation to that. The policy is working. There have been no boat arrivals on the Australian mainland since August last year. There have been none to our territories since November. That is a very significant and beneficial position to be in.I cannot say that is not going to change. I noticed New Zealand is embarking on an overseas information campaign at the moment to draw to the attention of people the dangers of these sorts of voyages, which can be life taking. These are not matters that are only of concern to us; they have been of concern to others. The reasons are very clear: other countries that have not been able to take the same action that we have been able to take are in a very much more disadvantaged position than we have been in. Our position has been essentially manageable and it has been manageable because of the policies that we have put in place.I notice that there are some who argue that we ought to adopt the failed policies that have been used in Europe. The United Kingdom had 88,000 asylum seekers last year -  twice what they had five years ago. They have lost track of more than 270,000 failed asylum seekers. France received 47,000 claims last year - up from something of the order of 21,000 five years ago. More than 90 per cent of people who are rejected asylum seekers in France cannot be located when people look for them to send them home.Mandatory detention has been a very important part of the program that was introduced by governments to deal with these issues. It was introduced first by a Labor government faced with fewer numbers of arrivals than we have seen in recent times. I am surprised that members of the Labor Party seem to have difficulty in being able to defend this policy in their own councils. Let me just say that, if they need some help in marshalling the arguments to be able to put these matters properly and forcefully, I would be willing to assist.The most compelling argument that you should be putting to the members of your own councils when they take to moving motions on this important area of public policy is that nobody ought to be encouraging policies or approaches that would encourage the people smugglers, those who trade in people's lives - and they do: 350 people lost their lives being trafficked into Australia - in their insidious trade. The fact is that they watch very closely for any suggestion that there are likely to be changes in public policy here in Australia. You only have to look back over some of the closely fought elections in the past to see the way in which the boat numbers ebbed and flowed when people thought there might be a change in public policy in Australia.Let me make it very clear: if the Labor Party want to keep on encouraging unlawful movement into Australia and to undermine the policies that are working, they should engage in this sort of insidious debate, which will hold out to the smugglers that there is some prospect of change if there were ever to be a change of government in Australia.</DOC>

 - We are fascinated by the Labor Party asking questions about interest rates because this government will put its record on the question of interest rates up against the Labor Party on any occasion. When this government was elected, the home mortgage variable interest rate was 10½ per cent. Today, it is 6¼ per cent - 4¼ per cent below. But that was the low point for the Australian Labor Party. Let us remind the Labor Party of its real achievement in relation to interest rates, because I do not think there has been an achievement in modern Australia that compares to it.The Australian Labor Party had interest rates at 17 per cent in 1990 - 17 per cent. In relation to the business overdraft rate, it was 21 per cent and 22 per cent. Even at today's rates of 6¼ per cent, these are the lowest interest rates in 30 years. It was not as if the economy was not growing when Labor was presiding over 10½ per cent back in 1994 or 1995. It was not as if we had actually been through a global recession in 1994 and 1995. It was not as if Asia had been through a financial downturn in 1994 and 1995. It was not as if we had been through a terrorist attack. No, Asia was booming, the world was booming, the Australian economy was growing and the lowest that the Australian Labor Party managed to get interest rates was 10½ per cent. People actually forget -  - The shadow minister for foreign affairs says that the reason why things are all so good is that it is all Mr Keating's good work. The member for Fraser says things are going bad and it is all the government; you say it is all going well and it is Mr Keating's responsibility. They have you coming and going, these fellows over there.Back in 1991, shortly after the Labor Party had taken Australian interest rates to 17 per cent and given Australia the recession which it had to have, the member for Fraser came back from a meeting of the IMF to pontificate about Australia's economy. He said:Last week, I had the opportunity to represent Australia at meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington. Such occasions tend to put domestic concerns into perspective. Three things struck me during the course of these meetings: first, we should never forget our relatively favourable situation. As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune.Back in 1991, the Australian Labor Party used to compare Australia with Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. I do not think you would ever hear a coalition minister walk to the dispatch box and say, `Things are going well compared to Mali or Bangladesh.' These days we do tend to compare ourselves with developed economies, rather than with Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. Even in relation to developed economies, Australia is doing pretty well. We will be the fastest growing economy amongst the advanced industrial economies in the next year. We no longer have to compare ourselves to Mali, Peru and Bangladesh.Australia is growing strongly. Our unemployment rate is low. Our interest rates are at a 30-year low at the current position. We did not have interest rates with a six or a seven in front of them when the government was elected; it was 10½ per cent under the Australian Labor Party. We have paid back $62 billion of the Labor Party's debt. We have come through the global slowdown of the US economy. We stood out during the Asian financial crisis. At every step of the way the Australian Labor Party fought this coalition in relation to good economic policy. We will not stand by and let the Australian Labor Party try and defeat good measures in the future. We intend to fight for the outcome of our budget, fight for Australia's future and look after Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question, and I note that he is a member of the Meat Workers Union in the days when unions were much better at representing ordinary Australians than they are now. It must be a real relief for the Leader of the Opposition that it is parliament today, because he is scared of the booing and jeering that he now gets every time he fronts a Labor Party conference. Last weekend he was mugged backstage at the Sydney Town Hall. This weekend the Queensland Labor conference resembled a S11 rally, except that the hate figure was not George Bush; it was Simon Crean. We even have the member for Brand - `Comeback Kim' - stalking the corridors of this building, talking up the 60-40 rule in opposition to the Leader of the Opposition. These days, the only people who give the Leader of the Opposition a polite hearing are coalition MPs, because that is the kind of people we are.According to the logic of the Leader of the Opposition, if the government were to give BHP and other big companies a 60 per cent shareholding in the coalition parties that would be a disaster, but if we were to reduce BHP to 50 per cent that would somehow make us a modern political party. Let me state for the record that this government will never, ever give any outside group any influence whatsoever in the councils of the coalition parties.The Leader of the Opposition set up for himself a leadership test which he is now comprehensively flunking. He is flunking his own test. He goes along to the Labor conference and talks about a 50-50 rule. Then he has a secret meeting in a Gold Coast penthouse with the union heavies from Queensland and he talks about giving unions even more representation inside the Labor Party. On this issue, the Leader of the Opposition is now telling more stories than Enid Blyton.Let us get it very clear: 13 per cent of the Australian population are union members, but 100 per cent of members opposite are union members. If you look at the Leader of the Opposition's own frontbench, you will see that he has got 11 former union officials, he has got seven former party officials, he has got seven former political staffers, and that leaves just four former public sector employees to represent the real people of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition's campaign to reduce union representation is a fake; it is as phoney as his attempt to deepen his voice. It is not fooling anyone except a few union dinosaurs with tiny brains.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the finding of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board. I am also aware, as I am sure the member for Barton is aware, that an independent ASIC investigation was carried out into National Textiles in August 2000. This was an independent investigation - the very thing that you have contemplated. It found that the evidence did not warrant action against former or existing directors and that any attempt to set aside the deed of company arrangement would not be in the public interest.I remind the member for Barton and others interested in this that the financial assistance that was extended to that company went entirely towards meeting the employee entitlements. I also remind him that your former leader, the member for Brand, went to a meeting of the employees of that company and exhorted the government to do the very thing it ended up doing. The money that we contributed to help the workers, not the directors, was matched dollar for dollar by the Labor Party.I happened to be in the Hunter at the weekend attending a number of functions in Newcastle and Charlestown. The people of that district, as they always do, afforded me a very courteous welcome indeed. As I gazed out at the audience, I saw a number of members of the opposition and also a larger number of members from my side of politics there, which indicates the changing political face of the Hunter Valley. As I launched a community partnership between that wonderful organisation Lifeline and Lend Lease at the Charlestown shopping centre, one of the faces I saw was that of Mr Richard Face, the Minister for Gaming and Racing and minister assisting the Premier of New South Wales in matters relating to the affairs and interests of the people of the Hunter Valley. The reason why I fixed my eyes on Mr Face, as I looked around that audience, is that I remembered that, at the height of the difficulties being suffered by the workers of National Textiles, he wrote me a very passionate letter urging the government to provide financial help to meet the workers' entitlements. I am proud of the fact that we helped the workers of that company, as we helped the workers of Ansett. They are policies designed to help the interests of Australian workers, and I am proud of what we did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member Boothby for his question. Obviously, that part of South Australia that he represents has an interest in the benefits of international trade as far as the auto industry is concerned. I, too, have a company in my electorate that exports automotive components all around the world. This particular negotiation will deliver significant benefits and opportunities to the auto sector.This historic announcement last Thursday between Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Thaskin that we are going to begin negotiating a closer economic relationship agreement between Thailand and Australia adds to the already comprehensive nature of our government's engagement with the East Asian region. It should be noted that, along with the negotiations for a free trade agreement that we are currently undertaking with Singapore and along with our negotiations and discussions with China, Japan and Korea, in September this year in Brunei we will be signing a framework agreement for a CEP - closer economic partnership - with the ASEAN countries. That is something that they have not done with any other nation or group of nations before. The 10 South-East Asian countries will be signing this accord with Australia and New Zealand.The CER agreement that we are going to embark upon negotiating with Thailand is quite significant in that, as our Prime Minister and Prime Minister Thaskin described last week - and I know the previous week when I met with Prime Minister Thaskin in Bangkok that he was talking in language like an FTA-plus - they want to negotiate something that is broader and deeper than just the issue of market access.The honourable member's question was about the issue of market access for the automotive sector and, of course, there are significant elements of gain to be had. Thailand is a significant automotive manufacturer, as is Australia. They are both complementary industries in that Australia's industry focuses on manufacturing large cars; the Thai industry focuses on manufacturing small cars and light commercial vehicles. So they are quite complementary. On the Thai side, they have tariffs of around 60 to 80 per cent, which we need to negotiate down over time to give our automotive exporters and particularly our component exporters, about which the member for Boothby has a particular interest, better access into that market. We will do that during the course of the negotiations with the Thais.This, along with a whole range of other indications that we have insofar as what we are going to be doing and what we are doing in the region with Singapore, Thailand, China, Japan and Korea, is a clear indication of our commitment to the integration of our economy in the East Asian region and the benefits that can accrue, particularly in the auto sector. In fact, a couple of our major automotive manufacturers commented very quickly and quite positively about the announcement of the negotiations of a closer economic relationship between Australia and Thailand. The President of Toyota Australia, Mr Ken Asano, said:I am delighted that the Australian government is playing such an active role in working to secure access for the Australian industry in the Asia-Pacific region.Holden Australia is a very successful part of the GM organisation world wide. Holden Executive Director of Corporate Affairs, Alison Terry, said:Access to the Thailand market would be beneficial for the Australian automotive industry. Ms Terry said:The two markets could be complementary, as Australian manufacturers specialised in large passenger vehicles while Thailand primarily produced small vehicles and light trucks.There is broad industry support and there is broad support across the community.It is interesting that in this process, leading up to the announcement last week, there has been a broad basis of bipartisan support in Thailand for this. There was an announcement at the start of this negotiation when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I were engaged with our respective counterparts in the previous government, Minister Supachai and Minister Surin Pitsuwan, in which we suggested that this would be good for both our economies. That has flowed through to the new government in Thailand. Prime Minister Thaksin, my counterpart and Minister Surakiart, the foreign minister, have all agreed that this is a good thing.Unfortunately, that does not happen in Australia. We have seen in recent times another backflip by the Australian Labor Party in their support for international engagement bilaterally through free trade agreements. Under the Labor Party in the last parliament, led by the member for Brand, there was bipartisan support for free trade agreements, but that has now completely diminished and has almost disappeared. It is something that the Australian people should be sad about.We know the reason why there has been a significant move within the Labor Party away from broad engagement in this way with our major trading partners, and it is because of the influence of the union movement in the Labor Party, because the Leader of the Opposition cannot break down the unions' 60 per cent control of the Labor Party. We all know where Doug Cameron stands on these issues. We are going ahead; we are taking Australia forward. We are engaging economically within our region and strengthening those linkages. The Australian Labor Party cannot do it because they are hamstrung by the union movement. They are controlled by the union movement. The Leader of the Opposition has failed in his one objective as the new Leader of the Australian Labor Party to reform the party: to get any balance in the management of the political branch of the Labor Party. We know where policy is formulated; it is formulated in the corridors of power in the Australian union movement. You have had two out of two losses in two appearances: once in Sydney and once in Brisbane. With the national conference to come, are you going to be able to sustain the debate on trade the way that Peter Cook and others did at the last national conference? Will you be able to beat Doug Cameron in that debate? It will be interesting to see the outcome.</DOC>

 - I do not think that anybody on the government's side in this debate has been interested in boosting insurance company profits. Of course there is no basis on which that allegation should be put or can be put, other than the honourable member's imagination. This government has responded to a situation which has a combination of factors: firstly, the fallout from September 11, which has made reinsurance around the world more expensive; secondly, an increased tendency towards litigation by individuals -  - My mates, are they? - A juvenile interjection from the member for Lyons - thirdly, a tendency for larger verdicts to be awarded; and of course contributing factors in relation to the way in which these claims are handled in the courts. As a result of that, the Commonwealth has gathered together two forums. I believe that they have been very positive. They certainly have been welcomed by the states, and I pay tribute to the work that Senator Coonan has done in relation to that. She has achieved agreement I think from most of the Labor states about the importance of putting hurdles in the way of liability and indeed discussing the question of capping damages. That will be a long-term solution.In the short term, there has been discussion as to pooling, and I pay tribute to some of the work that some of the states have done. I think the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who has been actively involved in this, has already informed the House of the way in which the Victorian government has offered public liability insurance which gives a pooling in relation to voluntary groups, and I think that that will be of enormous benefit.I am aware that there has been a request for an amendment to the Trade Practices Act which prohibits people who are organising adventure-type holidays from ducking liability according to contractual clauses. That has been put forward, and I think Senator Coonan has indicated that she is quite amenable to such an amendment and will be looking very carefully at it. I cannot recall whether or not she has announced it as a matter of policy.In addition to that, from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's point of view, if there are provisions which are required in relation to this matter which would otherwise be in breach of competition, it is possible for those to be looked at and either an authorisation to be given or an amendment to the statute to be made. That is a matter which is coming out of the discussions between the Commonwealth and the states which the government is advancing, and I believe that they have been very positive discussions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I know that the member is very interested in the progress the government is making in our ambition to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States, particularly given that the good working relationship between our coalition government and the Bush administration has delivered extra market access -  - for citrus grown in the member's electorate into those wealthier markets of the west coast.  - And the member for Riverina has access into those markets of the west coast of the States. The relationship that exists between our government and that of the US administration is significantly positive at the moment. I can report that on the basis of discussions I had in the margins of the APEC ministerial meeting last week with US TR Bob Zoellick. There are some very positive signs ahead in terms of the opportunities that will present themselves if we can get agreement to go ahead and negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. - Observers would recognise that the trade promotion authority bill has now passed through the House and the Senate and it is moving on to the conference stage of the processes in the United States. Indications are that they will produce a bill and a trade promotion authority for the administration in the coming months, which will allow them to go ahead not only to negotiate cleanly in the multilateral circumstance in the WTO but also to embark upon a range of bilateral negotiations, and we would hopefully expect one with Australia.It is important to note that the studies that have been undertaken as far as the benefits that would accrue from a free trade agreement with the United States are quite compelling. An FTA with the US would deliver up to $4 billion per annum to Australian farmers, manufacturers, tourism operators and other businesses. This is too important a policy objective to ignore, but of course again we have seen from the Labor Party the flip-flop that we have been used to over the last six or seven years in terms of policy positions. Last year when we first put to the United States, to the Bush administration, our ambitions about negotiating a free trade agreement, I was asked whether there was bipartisan support. Of course, at that time there was, because I had a meeting with the then shadow minister, Peter Cook, who provided that.This year I had further discussions with the United States, and prior to that I was asked a question by a journalist. The journalist said, `Minister, the United States - or the Bush administration - last year were very interested in whether there was bipartisan support and whether they could commit to a negotiation. It doesn't seem like you have that.' We now know we do not because the Crean-led Labor Party have moved away from that position. I said to the journalist, `That was last year. That was the middle of last year and the Bush administration were keen to see there was bipartisan support. A very important event has taken place since, and it happened on 10 November, and we won. We're now the government, and we can negotiate that.' I retold that story to Bob Zoellick, and Bob Zoellick indicated that he was a bit concerned that the Labor Party had moved away from their position of traditional in-principle policy in areas of trade -  and they have, and it has actually been all over the shop.I will give you some quotes. We have seen headline after headline of Labor walking away from a commitment to free trade agreements with the United States. The member for Cunningham, in his media releases and in his personal explanations in this House, has been saying Labor really does support one, yet on 4 February he said free trade agreements with our major trading partners were `crucial' for Australian industry. He was right; he was absolutely right, and that is the position that our government takes. Then on 13 February the member for Cunningham said:The coded language in the Governor-General's address to the opening of parliament yesterday indicated that the Howard Government has no real commitment to ... a free trade agreement with the United States because it is too `difficult'.He could not be further from the truth there: we are absolutely committed because of the economic benefits that it will deliver to our economy. On 7 March he said:If Mr Howard follows the US down the road of exclusive, one-on-one trade deals, he abandons Australia's proud reputation as a global free-trader ...I can tell the member for Cunningham we are leading the way in driving the agenda in the multilateral scene in the WTO; we are driving that agenda ahead. Then in a media release on 10 May he said:A bilateral FTA with the US will do nothing for Australia's long-term trade interests.In the House on 14 May he said it was not true that he had rejected the proposed FTA with the United States. Then the Leader of the Opposition, in a media release on 23 May this year, said the FTA:... should be off the table as along as the Farm Bill is on the statute books.The Leader of the Opposition may or may not realise that the farm bill has been on the statute books since the 1930s. - If he is just going to depart from the field and not put up a fight to reduce the structured mechanisms -  - that are in place that the Australian Labor Party signed off on - they signed off on them coming out of the Uruguay Round -  -  - That is what we are up against. We are going to argue against those in a free trade agreement negotiation. We are going to argue against those in the multilateral system in the WTO. The Labor Party wants to leave the field and become isolationist and not engage with the rest of the world. But one of the other more interesting aspects of the debate about the free trade agreement with the US is that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and we have heard from the member for Cunningham, but we have not heard from the member for Griffith on his position, because I suspect he may still support the old Peter Cook-Kim Beazley line that we should be engaging more with the United States of America.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Greenway for his question. It certainly gives me an opportunity to outline what the government is doing in the area of disability support. The first point I would like to emphasise is that we are not altering the rate of the DSP payment to those who are eligible for it. What we are doing, though, is ensuring that those people who receive a disability support pension, particularly future people who may enter the scheme, are given every opportunity through training and rehabilitation to properly access the labour market, instead of leaving them to languish like you did in your 13-year stewardship.I would like to quote some figures. In 1992 we saw the biggest increase in disability support pensions - 13.26 per cent. Wasn't that coincidental? That was just before the election in 1993. We also saw huge increases of 7.4 per cent in 1993, 6.49 per cent and on it goes. There is an absolute need, which the Australian community recognises, to ensure that we prudently provide assistance to those people on the disability support pension, rather than leaving them to languish on this type of payment, which is what you have wanted to do. You have given no assistance to these people and given them no opportunity, particularly when it comes to retraining for the labour force.I notice that recently there have been a number of comments made about the SACS Award. The Commonwealth government is absolutely committed when it comes to employment assistance. In the proposal which went through this parliament last week -  - As far as the disability support pension and welfare reform are concerned, the key elements are to get the next Commonwealth disability support agreement through the Senate. With the employment assistance bill, we are going from $1.3 billion to over $2 billion for employment assistance programs. As far as the SACS Award is concerned, we hope that the New South Wales government, for which we have given, through our previous agreements, indexation arrangements -  - As far as other work is concerned, I understand that Senator Amanda Vanstone and other members are having further discussions on that matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and I thank him for his longstanding commitment and support of our defence forces and our reservists. The 2000 defence white paper articulated a new role for reservists. No longer will the reservists be used for domestic mobilisation of our forces in times of conflict; reservists will now have a new integrated role within the Australian Defence Force. Already many reservists have been integrated into regular ADF units - 210 reservists actually served with 6RAR in East Timor. A company manned largely by reservists will be deployed at the next Australian rotation in East Timor at the end of this year. This will be the first time since World War II that a formed combat arms unit of Army reservist soldiers will actually be deployed on operations. Reservists have been deployed in significant numbers in INTERFET and UNTAET operations in East Timor since 1999. They have consistently proved that they can do the job, and they have done so admirably.Last year the government introduced legislation to modernise the Australian Defence Force Reserves so that reservists can be called upon for a broader range of operations and individuals and units can actually be held at high levels of readiness. This government will provide employment, education and financial liability protection measures for reservists and their dependants through the Office of Reserve Service Protection. Since the introduction of the government's employer support payments scheme in June 2001, $5.6 million has been paid to the employers of reservists to offset costs associated with the absence of reservists from their workplace. The weekend before last I launched a new advertising campaign focusing on the benefits of joining the Army Reserve. This follows a successful testimonial style advertising campaign that contributed to a major turnaround in ADF recruitment. In fact, in 2000-01 there was a 34 per cent increase in ADF recruitment over the previous year. This is a positive trend, and it has continued this year. The most recently available figures indicate that, to date, we have 750 more recruits than at the same time last year. This government is committed to the support of reservists and their families, while making reserve services more attractive, enhancing the overall capability of the ADF and delivering on the government's commitment to the 2000 white paper. The Leader of the Opposition may be interested to know that there was never such a great time to be a reservist.</DOC>

This is an unusual package of legislation that is designed to meet very unusual circumstances. It requires very careful consideration, which it has been getting, and we are looking forward to further cooperation in the finalisation of the legislation from members opposite and in particular from Senator Faulkner and the member for Banks.

 - I thank the member for Paterson. He is one of the truly representative members in here who gets out to the Work for the Dole projects, understands the real people, deals with them and tries to inspire unemployed people, and I congratulate him for it. There are 87 Work for the Dole projects with about 840-odd placements in the electorate of Paterson and throughout the Hunter Valley. I recall some time ago the member for Hunter complaining that there were not any Work for the Dole programs, or that there was only one in his electorate, and I am sure that has been well and truly rectified since the days of the pilot.Today I announced a further 1,310 of Australia's unemployed will be working in their local communities on worthwhile Work for the Dole projects, providing them with real work opportunities in 137 different projects and providing some real benefits to their local communities. One thing is unequivocal: this government is totally committed to Work for the Dole. There have been some 8,900 Work for the Dole projects and over 176,000 places in Work for the Dole. That is since the days when the member for Brand, when asked on 2UE by Alan Jones what he thought of Work for the Dole said, `I think it has been a failure and I will tell you why. Firstly, there have not been enough places.' I can assure the member for Brand that we have delivered more places, and in the last budget there will be another 8,500 new places in Work for the Dole as well.I am also asked about alternative policy. There is obviously great confusion on this issue as well as many others - as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised today. The member for Grayndler has said that Work for the Dole schemes are only designed to punish. The member for Brand said that Work for the Dole was devised as social punishment. The Chief Opposition Whip said that Work for the Dole is nothing more than an expensive PR exercise. Senator Faulkner said that Work for the Dole was designed to blame the victims. The member for Chifley said that this government has put in place a horrific Work for the Dole scheme.  - It is hard to believe I know, Prime Minister. You would think on the back of that that there is no way that the opposition would have taken Work for the Dole to the people at the last election. I can inform the House that under real results from Work for the Dole, a policy statement released by Cheryl Kernot - now there is a name from the past - the then Opposition Leader on 3 November said:Labor is committed to retaining work for the dole.We all know that since then the Labor Party has wiped the slate clean. They no longer have any policies. I guess we are now waiting on - other than Cheryl Kernot's book -  Dougie Cameron to have another stop-work meeting. He is going to call the brothers together, they are going to have a bit of policy discussion and they are going to come forward to you, the Leader of the Opposition, to tell you what you should be thinking and what you should be telling the Australian public - because Queensland and New South Wales have both told you what you should think.</DOC>

 - The answer to the penultimate section of the member for Kennedy's question is of course yes. It is a practice that I follow with all members of the House. I would like to say, if the member for Corio were present as my shadow minister, that if he were to bring Mayor Soorley down here to talk further about my proposals for an inquiry into cost shifting between state and local governments - or maybe the member for Griffith - then of course I would certainly welcome him bringing the mayor around. He could enlighten me further on the motions carried at the recent Queensland Labor Party conference, into which I believe he had some input. There is a serious problem at all times for people residing in electorates like mine, and of course Kennedy. I was present recently at Boulia, in the western segment of Queensland, at a local government conference and I was able to bring to their attention the proposals of the inquiry I have mentioned in this House before. Since then I have been to Muttaburra near Longreach, in probably the only electorate we do not hold in Queensland, and I noted that, notwithstanding the very important Year of the Outback occasion for those people and the people of Longreach, I did not bump into the member for Capricornia. That person was not there to explain to me any of the difficulties arising in those regions, where drought, amongst other things, is very threatening. I would give all support possible in the forums of our party in making representations, be they brought by the member for Kennedy or any member of this House, were they brought forward in a positive way, on means whereby the government could assist. When I was at Boulia I did not have those representations made to me. My office is open and I will have someone contact the member for Kennedy to ensure that a meeting is arranged at their convenience. May I repeat that, instead of getting up in this place and bagging your constituents and identifying them as unemployed, bring them to the appropriate minister, Labor Party, because we will always do our best.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I know from visiting his electorate what a keen advocate he is of industry in his electorate. He and members on both sides, I would hope, would be interested to know that today I opened one of Toyota's most innovative advances in their plant in Altona in Victoria. We opened, as part of the $321 million expansion, a new stamping plant. Had it not been for industrial action it would have been the first of its type in the world, but, thanks to industrial action, we have been relegated to third place.It pleases me to see this investment by Toyota, which comes at the same time as Holden's $400 million expansion with the V6 motor plant -  - and Ford's $500 million commitment to the introduction of a new model. The member for Boothby is very aware of the $700 million expansion by Mitsubishi. At a time when the car industry worldwide is making some very hard decisions and in fact Ford are closing seven plants, retrenching some 35,000 employees, it pleases me greatly that the Australian industry is not included in any of those redundancies and in fact is moving ahead. We have also seen very significant expansion in exports and the car industry in Australia is now exporting some $5 billion worth of motor vehicles. The car industry is producing an extraordinary world-class product, and the product that I saw this morning behind the curtains at the Toyota plant will certainly give other Australian producers something of a run for their money -  - I am sure that, with the release of the new Camry, which sets a new standard in automotive production in Australia with this new stamping plant which produces one body piece on the side in one stamp, Australia's other manufacturers will continue to rise to the challenges of producing world-class motor vehicles. The member for Aston asked me what threats there were to the car industry. There are none from the member for Rankin because they do not have a policy, but, were they to have a policy, under the 60-40 rule it would be written for them by Dougie Cameron. What is Dougie Cameron's policy for the car industry?  - Dougie Cameron said that the car industry can expect more disputes. Here we have an industry in Australia that is moving to be internationally competitive, a world competitive producer of motor vehicles, and what is the union leadership doing? It is doing everything it can to stop that progress, to practise industrial vandalism which brings the car industry to its knees. I cannot understand why. It threatens the jobs of Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. This issue has been under consideration by the government. It had previously been the subject of a number of statements by the Attorney-General and the foreign minister. A number of members of the government have reservations about it. As a consequence of that, I have initiated a process of consultation within the government parties regarding the matter, and when that process of consultation is -  - As always, it will take as long as is needed. At the end of the day, the decision to be taken by the government will be the decision which most properly matches Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I can inform him that the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends, which was released today, shows that the Australian economy continues to grow strongly. Business confidence remains strong, with a net balance of plus 20, reporting an improved business situation in the June quarter, down marginally from the March quarter but still well above the negative 24 per cent recorded after the events of 11 September. New orders received were stronger for the fifth consecutive quarter. Both output and exports are up, with a net balance of plus 32 per cent and plus 23 per cent respectively. Capital expenditure plans remain solid, supported by high levels of capacity utilisation and strong profitability. Employment expectations remain strong by historical standards, at plus three per cent, consistent with strengthening economic activity.That shows that Australian business is quite positive and quite confident about the year that is ahead. It would confirm that Australia in the current quarter is continuing to grow. We will have tomorrow the national accounts for the March quarter of 2002 but, to the end of 2001, the Australian economy through the year grew at 4.1 per cent, the strongest growth of any of the Western developed economies. When you put that together with an American recession, a Japanese recession, a German recession, a Singaporean recession, a Taiwanese recession, a global slowdown and the events of September 11, the fact that the Australian economy continued to grow through 2001 is a great credit to Australian businesses, the entrepreneurs that run them and the people who have been keeping the Australian economy strong during that period.We on this side of the House like to see business doing well. We understand that, unless business is doing well, you will not have the growth and the jobs which are required to give young people an opportunity in life. We want to keep the Australian economy strong. It has been the strongest in the developed world. You would think that both sides of parliament would be happy with a strong economy. I am sure that both sides of the parliament would be pleased that the Australian economy is strong. We will have the national accounts tomorrow. They will give us a fix on 2002, but we do think it is important that business continues to operate properly and creates jobs in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I would like to take this opportunity to say what an excellent job she does for the people of Forde. She is a very good member; she knocked off the Labor Party there time and time again.Illegal immigration and people-smuggling are serious issues for many governments around the world and they are grappling with those problems. The seriousness of the problem as the European governments would see it was reflected in the proposal for illegal immigration to be a keynote theme for the European Union leaders' summit in Seville in Spain later this month. Many European governments are introducing or exploring measures which will parallel the sort of strong response that Australia has taken. For example, the UK government recently announced a number of new measures, including the establishment of accommodation centres, tough legislative measures to remove failed asylum seekers and substantial expansion of secure detention facilities. Other European countries, and I would mention Denmark and Italy here, are also introducing measures to tighten border control and to crack down on illegal immigration. These are also big issues in Germany, France and so on. I thought it was very interesting when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Deputy Prime Minister and I were in Brussels a few weeks ago for meetings with the European Community and European Union leadership and we had quite an extensive discussion about this issue of illegal immigration. Far from these leaders of Europe criticising Australia, they showed a very genuine interest in the strong position we are taking and they agreed to establish a process of dialogue and consultation between the European Union and Australia. Australia has been strong and tough on this issue. Australia is effective at dealing with it. The European countries increasingly understand the strength and effectiveness of Australia's position and it gives the lie to the suggestion by what I love to call in this House the `bourgeois Left' that somehow -  -  - Amongst you, some of you aspire to be bourgeois and the rest of you are.  - I assure the Leader of the Opposition that no-one there is a member of the Left. The point is that Australia's reputation has not been damaged; on the contrary, the international community are interested in what Australia does and they want to talk to us. This stands in juxtaposition to the positions that others take on this issue, not least the Australian Labor Party. It is hard to know what their policy could conceivably be. It has been said already this week in the House that the New South Wales and Queensland branches of the Labor Party repudiated the policy of so-called mandatory detention. In other words, their position is that they want people to be released into the community immediately when they arrive. I noticed quotes by the Labor Party. The latest was made yesterday by the member for Lalor who said:I haven't met anybody in the ALP yet who does not agree with the proposition that on arrival people should be detained.This is a member of the Victorian branch obviously not focusing on what the Queensland and New South Wales branches of the party are saying. In his doorstops, the Leader of the Opposition seems to be saying that, actually, we agree with detention just so you can check people's credentials, but once their credentials are checked, once it is established for example that these people are not refugees, our policy is to allow those illegal immigrants into the community.  - Now he says that is not right, but that is quite clearly what he said on the 7.30 Report last night. The simple fact is that the Labor Party went to the last election supporting the government's policy on this issue of detention and there was not a `cigarette paper's difference', I think members of the opposition said - it could even have been the member for Brand who said that. They said that this isn't an election about illegal immigration; it is about something else. Labor members got elected on the basis of telling people that that was their policy and, no sooner had the votes been counted, Labor members were back in their seats and they started to change their policy.I make a prediction. At the next election, after turmoil in the Labor Party for three years, they will go back to where they were in November last year; they will go back to the same policy. I would not be surprised if they went back to the same leader, because there is a saying these days that the Labor Party is like a chessboard, with the king in the back row and the pawns in the front. The Leader of the Opposition said, `If you are a betting person, back me.' Some have it that the odds for the Leader of the Opposition are 50-50, but there are others who say the member for Brand is odds on at 60-40.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The recent defence advertising has been particularly successful in contributing to an increased recruitment across the whole ADF. This began with the lifestyle campaign of September 1999 and continued with the testimonial campaign that began in February 2001. I am delighted to advise the House that, as of February 2002, these two campaigns have contributed to a 44.5 per cent increase in overall recruitment achievement. The latest advertising campaign builds upon this success and promotes the Army Reserve as a part-time job that adds to your life.It is true that Defence has faced a number of challenges in meeting reserve recruitment targets. However, the leverage gained from existing non-reserve advertising and the Army's direct to unit recruitment trial have been successful in gaining a 30 per cent increase in the number of reservists recruited by the end of November last year. This is especially good when compared with previous years.In recognition of the importance of reservists, the government has introduced a suite of legislation and other initiatives to make reserve service more attractive and to support the employers of reservists. This includes - and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is interested in this - the introduction of the Employer Support Payment Scheme. Already from this scheme $5.6 million has been drawn and paid to employers. This is to assist them with the absence of their employees while they are doing their reserve service. The scheme provides a payment of $807 per week to the employer. Additionally, the Office of Reserve Service Protection has been established and this provides employment, financial and educational protection for reservists as they undertake full-time service.We were also asked about the common induction training. This was introduced to ensure that reservists were trained at the same level of expertise and competencies as their full-time counterparts. The success of this program is evidenced by the performance of our reservists in East Timor and by the deployment later this year of a company of full-time reservists who will form the first combat arms unit that will deploy overseas. The government recognises that not all reservists can commit to a 45-day period away from their regular employment and for this reason the Army is conducting ongoing trials to deliver a common induction training in modular form. This modular form training will allow more flexibility without being detrimental to the outcome of the training.This government is committed to supporting the ADF and our reserves and ensuring that we have a modern capable Army that is able to support and sustain contemporary military operations. I would encourage those opposite to join our government in the support of our Army reservists and the increased number that we have in our reserves. - It is confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, because she asked me today about the level of cooperation that Australia is receiving in relation to people-smuggling issues. It is particularly important that we have in the gallery today His Excellency Sar Kheng, the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, because in July 2001 there was a very important turning point in dealing with people-smuggling when the government of Cambodia intercepted a boat that was bound for Australia with over 200 people on board, where the smugglers from Indonesia had been endeavouring to open up a new route by which people might be able to access Australia. I am delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia and General Hok Lundi are here, because their military and police were able to detain those people who were intent on getting on another vessel that may well have not been able to successfully reach Australia and people's lives could have been potentially put at risk. But what we did find out on that occasion was that there were people on board the vessel who had with them travel documents which, if they had been coming to Australia, would have been disposed of before they came here. We were able to ascertain that identity fraud was rife -  - We know because the people were caught and identified -  - and the documents were with them and the information was passed on to us. We were in a position to see the way in which those issues were able to be handled where most of the people, who if they had arrived in Australia were thought likely to claim to be Afghan, had residency rights in Pakistan or were Pakistanis and were able to return to Pakistan. The fact is that under the cooperation arrangements between Cambodia and Australia those returns have been able to be implemented. We do thank the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia and his colleagues for that high level of cooperation, and we are delighted that he is able to be here in Australia at this time.We have had good cooperation from other transit countries such as Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. My Indonesian counterpart has said to me on a number of occasions that the reason they experience significant movements of people unlawfully through Indonesia is as a result of what they see to be the `sugar' in Australia. Their concern is that there are a number of attractions which prompt people to pass through a situation where they would be safe and secure to get to Australia. That is related to the level of benefits if people are freed into the community. It is related to what they perceive to be the nature of the protection system and what it would mean.The temporary protection visa regime has been an important aspect of our strategy to address these issues, because it ensures that those people who come through an orderly refugee resettlement program are able to get a permanent residency outcome, as distinct from those who arrive without lawful authority. We have been able to increase significantly the penalties for those who are involved in smuggling. We have the mandatory detention regime that ensures that people who are not refugees do not achieve an immigration outcome; that they are available for processing; that health, character and security issues are able to be addressed; and, most importantly, if they are not refugees, that they are available for removal - the most important deterrent for ensuring that our protection system is not abused. The integrity of our borders and the important refugee resettlement program that we wish to be able to maintain are the very reasons that we implement policies of this sort.Are we out of step with what is happening elsewhere? Certainly not. In the United Kingdom at the moment there is a bill before the parliament to raise the people-smuggling penalties from two years to 14 years. Italy is considering penalties of up to 15 years. Most European countries are engaged now in trying to limit forum shopping. Switzerland is concerned that if it does not take firmer action on these issues it too will become too attractive, as it says in its own statements.When you look at what is happening in relation to detention you will see that countries that have much larger movements than we have are trying to see how they can develop arrangements whereby they can secure people available for removal. Britain has been opening up disused jails in order to convert them into detention centres for those people who have to be removed. Of course, the real danger for us is what I said yesterday: if we have mixed signals going out there at a time when we have been able to send a very clear message to those who are involved in this insidious business of people-smuggling that they will not be able to succeed in their objectives, what do we have?We have the Queensland and New South Wales branches of the ALP expressing views on mandatory detention and temporary protection visas that are designed to make Australia a more attractive destination. It is not going to stop there. They will be taking these resolutions to the national conference of the ALP, where they will be seeking endorsement. It is not just the branches; we have had shadow ministers going out there. Kate Lundy, for instance, addressing the Labor for Refugees forum on 22 May said:In my opinion, mandatory detention in its current form is not an acceptable way to process asylum seekers.She went on to say:I will argue within the Labor Party that any policy of detaining asylum seekers must not be with the objective of deterring refugees from arriving in Australia. We must discard the mindset that immigration policy is about protecting our borders.You cannot escape from the reality of those sorts of comments coming from your frontbench. It is an area in which the Leader of the Opposition should be able to display some effective leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I point out that she is certainly one of the hardest working members of this House. It is a sure sign of a weak leader that he should set for himself a trivial objective and then struggle to achieve it. The Leader of the Opposition has made achieving a 50 per cent union bloc vote the ultimate test of his leadership. His frontbench colleagues know that this is just a giant game of Trivial Pursuit. The Canberra Times on 29 November 2001 said:Mr McMullan, in his first interview with this newspaper as Labor treasury spokesman, said ... It mattered little whether unions had 60 per cent of votes at state conference, as they do in most states, or 50 per cent, as in the ACT.The member for Fraser also gave the Leader of the Opposition six months to establish an image. - The member for Fraser gave the Leader of the Opposition six months to establish an image. - Six months is up, and I note that at 24 per cent the percentage of Australians who rate the Leader of the Opposition as a better Prime Minister has dropped below the percentage of people who are members of trade unions! - It is because of this poor performance that we have the member for Brand contemplating the most improbable comeback since Tony Lockett! There he is -  old plugger Beazley imagining himself as the shadow leader! - Let me refer to the member for Watson as the chief numbers man for the member for Brand. - I will indeed, Mr Speaker. I have been asked about South Australia. South Australia already has a 50-50 rule in operation, so let us see how the Leader of the Opposition's brave new world operates. A couple of years back, the ALP's National Vice-President did a comprehensive report on the operation of the South Australian ALP. It is stated:Lynette Breuer said yesterday her investigation showed dead people were among the 2,000 new members signed up in job lots by faction operators seeking to control elections. - He's back! The member for Brand! - I am referring to registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act and their work in debauching and factionalising the South Australian Labor Party. I am quoting the report of the National Vice-President of the Labor Party. She said:Most of the 2,000 new memberships -  - I am talking about the state of South Australia, where the 50-50 rule applies, and I am quoting a report which says:Most of the 2,000 new memberships - a recruitment drive that almost doubled the ALP's state subbranch membership overnight -  - I am quoting from an official ALP report which said:Most of the 2,000 new memberships - a recruitment drive that almost doubled the ALP's state subbranch membership overnight -  - The union bloc vote is the Labor Party's dirty little secret, and that is why they are so keen to close down this debate. I again quote the report:Most of the 2,000 new memberships - a recruitment drive that almost doubled the ALP's state subbranch membership overnight -  - I was asked about the use of bloc votes at a political level. In the South Australian Labor Party, under the 50-50 rule, the doubling of the branch membership was paid for with about $40,000 in union funds at the concessional pensioner rate. -  - Plainly this succession of points of order is in deference to the member for Werriwa's demand that his colleagues have testosterone enhancement therapy. - I have been asked about the bloc vote in South Australia. Let me say this: a 38 per cent shareholding gives Kerry Packer control of Channel 9, a 30 per cent shareholding gives Rupert Murdoch control of News Limited and a 50 per cent shareholding will leave the unions in complete control of the Labor Party. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. His question was quite complex and I would like to -  - No, I don't actually. - No. - There was a series of questions in his question, but I would like to address the Seasprite helicopters issue because -  -  - I thought that it was also about other budgets. While Labor has made a number of attempts to discredit this project for political gain, the fact is that the previous Labor government is closely identified with it. The decision to procure the helicopters was announced by Labor in its May 1995 budget, when Senator Ray was the Minister for Defence. The request for tender documentation was issued late in 1995, and the binding tenders closed in March 1996. This was a mere footfall after Labor was swept from power by the coalition government. - Labor has claimed that the contracts entered into between the Commonwealth and Kaman Aerospace International Corp. leave a lot to be desired. For example, Labor claims that the acquisition contracts do not adequately protect the Commonwealth's interests because they do not contain liquidated damage clauses. The fact is that the original contract issued with the request for tender in 1995 by Labor did not include a liquidated damage clause, despite the fact that standard defence purchasing tender documentation included reference to such a clause. Labor now seeks to belittle that part of the Kaman proposal that was based on refurbished and modified Seasprite frames. It would do better to remember that this proposal was permitted by, and is valued in accordance with, the request for tender documentation issued under Labor. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. Of course, agriculture will be a top priority in a free trade agreement negotiation with the United States. A free trade agreement with the US, as independent analysis has indicated, will add $4 billion to the Australian bottom line. It will mean many more and much better jobs for Australian industry and a much better circumstance for Australian families.The member for Maranoa also asked about alternative policies. We can recall that prior to the election last year the Labor Party, led by the member for Brand, had a position of supporting a free trade agreement with the US, but of course since then there has been a significant change, one - I would venture to say - being brought about by the 60 per cent control of the Labor Party by the union movement - in particular, one Dougie Cameron. So we know now that Labor opposes the very measure that would deliver an extra $4 billion to the Australian bottom line. Labor opposes a measure that would add extra and better paid jobs to the Australian economy. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and his trade spokesman do not support a free trade agreement with the United States, with the strings being pulled by Dougie Cameron and the unions that control the Labor Party. But what we do not know is: where is Labor's media hungry shadow spokesman on foreign affairs on this issue? We have not heard much from the member for Griffith. Is his embarrassed silence on this an indication that he supports the government's position? It is said around the corridors of this place that if you put a comb in front of him he will talk into it. Maybe we should put a comb in front of him, and he will give us an idea of his position as far as a FTA with the United States is concerned.On this side of the House we have stuck with the policy that we had in the lead-up to the last election. We stand very squarely behind our pursuit of a free trade agreement with the United States. We stand united in our pursuit of an extra $4 billion for the Australian bottom line. We stand in the pursuit of extra jobs and better jobs for Australians as a result of increased trade with the United States. But the same cannot be said for the member for Cunningham, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Rankin - and we still do not know where the member for Griffith stands on this. But we sure know where the trade union movement in Australia, particularly Doug Cameron, stand on this. So if we know that, ipso facto we know exactly where the Australian Labor Party will stand.</DOC>

 - No, it is not. That is completely false. The Labor Party think that, if they repeat something often enough, various people will start to believe it. It is absolutely not the case. As I think we have been through previously, the currency swaps, which were entered into by the Australian Labor Party government back in 1987, as I recall, go for a period of over 10 years. In order to bring them to account, one has to over a period of 10 years look at both the stock valuation and the interest rates. As to the allegation, that is completely false. Not even the shadow finance minister in the Senate was able to produce any papers to the contrary.As for the proposition in relation to interest rates, we love getting questions about interest rates. The current variable mortgage interest rate is 6.3 per cent. The Labor Party want to make out that somehow interest rates are high at 6.3 per cent or at 6½ per cent. We have done a bit of research on this point. We found out that the member for Fraser was the parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer for a period of three years, and that was at the time the Labor Party entered currency swaps. During the three years that the member for Fraser was the parliamentary secretary -  - The shadow minister for foreign affairs is talking but there is no comb in front of his face. The member for Fraser is concerned about an interest rate which is currently at 6¼ per cent and wants to feign concern that it may be at 6½ per cent. The member for Fraser was the parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer for three years from 4 April 1990 to 24 March 1993, and the home mortgage variable interest rate average over those three years - this man who is concerned about a 6¼ home variable interest rate - was 12.9 per cent. So the Labor Party says to the coalition, `Shame, coalition, your standard variable mortgage interest rate is only half the average of the Labor Party's.' This is apparently the big political attack from the Australian Labor Party. I guess the member for Fraser was lucky that he became the parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer on 4 April 1990. If he had been in that position prior to the 1990 election, his 12.9 per cent average would have had 17 per cent rates which were added into it.On the last point, this of course is how the Labor Party shot themselves in the foot after the budget. On the one hand, the Labor Party would like to say, `Keep fiscal policy strong so that fiscal policy takes pressure off interest rates.' That is the implication. On the other hand, the Labor Party want to say, `We will vote against all of the savings measures in the budget. We will vote against the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We will vote against the changes in relation to disability support pension.' - The Labor Party want to say, `We will vote down the government's policies in relation to superannuation and put in place unfunded policies in their place.' The point is this: the Labor Party can have one position or the other. You can take the position that you want strong fiscal policy, because fiscal policy and monetary policy is related, or you can take the position that you reserve the right to vote down savings measures. You can take one position or the other, but you cannot take both. The Labor Party tactics committee when it meets tomorrow should decide which it is going to take. - Where is the alternative? Shortly the alternative will probably be an alternative as Leader of the Opposition. - As Senator George Campbell said this morning on the way into the parliament, speaking of the current Leader of the Opposition -  - You do not agree with Senator George Campbell? - Mr Speaker, Senator George Campbell said:I think to some degree he's got stuck on the 60:40 issue, and in many respects it is not the key issue. There are other more fundamental reform issues that ought to be dealt with and I suppose it's time for him to move on to those more fundamental issues and start canvassing them across the party ...And here is the wake-up call from Senator George Campbell. Senator George Campbell said that we:... ought to give him a fair go and let's see in 12 months time just how effectively he's performing.George has given you 12 months. The member for Fraser gave you six months. We will wait and we will see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson not only for his question but, importantly, also for the lifetime he has spent in making sure that the streets of Brisbane are safe. He has a played a significant role in the investigation leading to the arrest of a number of criminals, including murderers, over the years and now he is keeping Dickson safe from the Australian Labor Party.I was somewhat taken aback this morning when I opened the Courier Mail in Queensland and there on the front page was a story entitled `Killer's Story Slays Critics'. It went on to say that a book by notorious killer Mark `Chopper' Read has received Education Queensland recommendation as a `valuable addition for senior school students'. It goes on to say:A review of Hooky the Cripple in which the hunchback son of a prostitute retaliates against a bullying butcher and stabs him 21 times, has appeared on the website of Access Z, the department unit that evaluates potential curriculum resources.It is rather interesting that the Australian newspaper today also in looking at the review of this book by a convicted murderer said of the review undertaken by the Queensland Department of Education:The book would be suitable for use with senior students for discussions on bullying or on the application of justice.The Queensland Minister for Education, Ms Anna Bligh, in responding to this - and I know that the member for Dickson will be somewhat concerned to hear this - said that the book would assist school communities in their decision making process as a guide. She said that individual schools in consultation with parents determine the material on school reading lists.One should never judge a book by its cover, but when you take into account that Mark `Chopper' Read was released from prison in 1998, having served six years for murder - a self-confessed murderer, criminal, assailant, arsonist and torturer and committer of a whole range of other criminal activities - the book that is being promoted by the Queensland Department of Education and by the Queensland Labor government has this as its cover. Whilst one should never judge a book by its cover, when you look at the credentials of the author one would have to question whether this is suitable. On 4QR this morning the Queensland Minister for Education, Anna Bligh, said in part:I think there is a question in the minds of some people about whether someone with Chopper Read's history should be able to profit from writing activity. But I think that's an individual moral assessment.She went on to say:Teachers and school communities will make the judgment about whether it ever appears in their classrooms, and any parent who has a concern should raise it with their schools.I can tell you that the members on this side of the House will be raising it with the Queensland government. I think the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, needs to come out today very quickly and reassure parents in Queensland that a murderer, arsonist, torturer and convicted criminal will not be elevated to mythology, will not be elevated in the minds of young Australians. We do not consider that that person, as an author of any book, is suitable to be promoted in any schools and in particular in Queensland. It is interesting that the Australian education unions do not seem as enthusiastic to keep Mr `Chopper' Read out of Queensland schools as they do the Governor-General. We should not be surprised, if we have governments and leaders in education that are prepared to say that right and wrong are decisions for individuals to make, if we do not provide a form of moral leadership -  - In the end it is a question of leadership. It is a question of people who seek to lead in education saying that there are some people, in view of their backgrounds, who should not be promoted as role models in the eyes of young Australians, that there is a difference between right and wrong. The Leader of the Opposition should get online to Sharan Burrow now and he should find out what the union's attitude is. He should tell Peter Beattie to withdraw this author and his book from Queensland schools. </DOC>

 - On this side of the House we are happy to talk about interest rates and to take questions on them every single day. The standard variable mortgage interest rate at the moment is 6.3 per cent. When the government was elected it was 10½ per cent. That means on a $100,000 mortgage you are saving today $350 a month compared to what you were paying under the Australian Labor Party. If standard variable mortgage interest rates move by 25 basis points on a $100,000 mortgage, that is about $20 a month. So if it moved by another 25 basis points, your saving, as opposed to the situation under the Labor Party, would be $330 per month. Today it is $350 -  - If it moved by 25 basis points, you would be paying $330 less than you were under the Labor Party. - So, compared with the Australian Labor Party's rate of 10½ per cent, the standard variable mortgage interest rate of 6.3 per cent represents a saving of $350 per month, or $4,200 per year. But of course that is taking it off the rate when the Labor Party left office. That was not the peak rate; that was not the rate that applied when the economy was growing in the late 1980s. That peak rate was 17 per cent back in the late 1980s.What is all of this in aid of? The Australian Labor Party anticipates strong national accounts tomorrow and, rather than ask a question about the national accounts or how Australia's economy is faring compared to the United States, the UK or even Mali, Bangladesh or Peru, the Australian Labor Party hope to get the subject onto interest rates and how interest rates are at 6.3 per cent. - Going up. Could I ask a question? - We do enjoy it when the Socialist Left interjects. Was there a period in 13 years of Labor government when the home mortgage variable interest rate had a six in front of it? Was there a period in 13 years of Labor government when the home mortgage variable interest rate had a seven in front of it? There was a period when it had a one and a seven in front of it, but there was never a period when it had a seven in front of it. At 6.3 per cent, standard variable mortgage interest rates are the lowest they have been in 30 years, as they would be at 6½ per cent. These are historically low interest rates in an economy which is growing faster than anywhere in the Western world. I would have thought both sides of the parliament would be happy to see an Australian economy which is growing. We certainly are, because that means more jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question and for her continuing concern about the health of her constituents, particularly those who are ageing. The most commonly prescribed medications in Australia under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are those related to lowering cholesterol. In fact, the most commonly prescribed medications are Zocor and Lipex, closely followed by Lipitor and Pravocol. The total cost of providing these medications for the 12 months to 31 December 2001 in Australia was $664 million, of which $580 million was funded by the Commonwealth government. If one looks at the actual cost in terms of prescription, every prescription of Lipex or Zocor costs the Commonwealth government on average around $80 per month, but this can vary between $55 and $114 depending on the dose. So the most commonly prescribed drugs in Australia cost the Commonwealth government under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme some $580 million. In terms of the actual payment which is made under this scheme for a drug that costs on average $80 per month but can range up to $114 per month, under the proposals that the government has introduced in this budget, for a concessional pensioner, a concessional payer, that would be a total of $4.60. So a drug which ranges from $55 to $114 per month in terms of the taxpayers' contribution towards the funding of it will for concessional payers under this budget cost a total of $4.60 and for those who are not concessional payers a total of $28.60. This illustrates the basic reason why this government is concerned to maintain an affordable and sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.The honourable member asks whether there is any threat to the affordability of these drugs. If we wish to retain an affordable scheme, if we wish to be able in the future to bring other new drugs online which can cost not only hundreds of dollars but in some cases thousands of dollars and make them available to Australians generally, we must deal with the Australian Labor Party, which is threatening in the Senate to block these changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.The real issue here is whether or not we wish to have a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is going to continue to be affordable for all Australians so that these sorts of drugs - which are very effective in preventing the effects of ageing, in lowering cholesterol, and which are providing people with a much more healthy lifestyle in older age - are going to be available to Australians into the future. The threat comes from the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is showing itself as simply a party for the elite in this country.  - The Leader of the Opposition laughs. Not only have we got a Labor Party which is dominated by one small section of the Australian population -  namely the unions - but also we now have a party which says that we are only concerned with the provision of pharmaceuticals to the wealthy in Australia. That will be the effect of preventing the changes from occurring in the Senate in relation to this matter. I remind the Australian Labor Party of what their former leader, former Prime Minister Paul Keating, said about this matter in 1990. - Paul Keating told this parliament in 1990 - and these words are just as applicable today as they were over 10 years ago: The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy. If the Australian Labor Party is concerned about ageing and older people in the Australian population, it will pass these measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for two things. The first is for giving me the opportunity to speak further about this matter; and the second is for confirming that the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party think that `Chopper' Read should be elevated to hero status amongst young Australians. The fact is -  -  - The Australian Film Commission provided funds to produce the film Chopper -  - The film Chopper received a restricted rating. It can only be seen by adults. It is not distributed to schools -  certainly not with the endorsement of any responsible education authority or, indeed, education minister. - The point that needs to be made here -  - and this is a fundamentally important point - is whether Mark `Chopper' Read, who visited a whole lot of adversity on a lot of other Australians, is writing the second instalment to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or a book about a fellow that stabs a person in the head 21 times. The fact is that as a nation we should not responsibly elevate to the status of a hero a person who has made a living trading in the misery of other human beings. That is the fundamental issue, and that is the problem with the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party is not able to distinguish between right and wrong and have a moral compass and a commonsense compass that immediately says, `This is wrong.' The Labor Party is not able -  - to look at something and say, `We should not distribute this to young Australians,' not because of the book, or the literature itself, but because of the person who wrote it and the consequences it will have for our children. If we provide a values-free education to young Australians, we should not be surprised if we produce values-free adults. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question. I take the opportunity to say that he has been very active in his representations on behalf of constituents and those concerned about sectarian violence in Indonesia. I know many Australians appreciate the hard work he has done on this issue.The government remain concerned about sectarian violence in Indonesia, and particularly the violence that has taken place in Maluku, Sulawesi and also Ambon. We deeply regret the loss of life and property; we condemn the violence committed by both sides - Christian and Muslim. We welcome the Malino agreements brokered at Indonesian government initiated peace talks, and we urge all parties to adhere to those agreements. The government are encouraged by the uneasy peace which is holding in central Sulawesi. Over 8,000 weapons have been surrendered and 124 places of worship destroyed in the conflict are to be rebuilt, so that is encouraging. We also welcome recent action taken by the Indonesian government against extremist elements in Ambon, including the arrest of the Laskar Jihad and the FKM leaders. However, we continue to urge authorities to uphold law and order impartially and to protect human rights, as well as to facilitate access for humanitarian relief to affected areas.I discussed these problems personally when I was in Indonesia a couple of weeks ago with the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare, Yusuf Kalla, and also with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, and Bambang Kesowo, the Cabinet Secretary. The Prime Minister is familiar with these people as well. The embassy has visited the affected areas on several occasions over the last three years.Finally, I am sure the constituents of the honourable member for Casey will be pleased to hear that the government has committed over $100 million in humanitarian relief to Indonesia since 1997-98, including for food and medical aid to the Maluku Islands. This is a big issue. I know a lot of Australians are concerned about it. We have taken it up on many occasions, including recently with the Indonesian government, and I am glad to say there is some slow progress being made by the Indonesian authorities in addressing these issues.</DOC>

 - As the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, I should provide the facts as I recall them. To the best of my knowledge - and I will provide further and better details to the Leader of the Opposition - the Australian Film Finance Corporation provided approximately $5 million for the production of the film Chopper. That is an independent body. Would the opposition have the government of the day interfere with a culturally independent organisation, as opposed to ministers for education, who are responsible, not only to the parliament but also to the public, for what is put on school curriculums and what is provided to schoolchildren within the care of state education departments? We have an opposition leader, firstly, who endorses the supply of `Chopper' Reid's book to the schoolchildren of Queensland and, secondly, who would compromise the cultural independence of federal agencies. The minister for education has rightly outlined for the House this government's concerns regarding this issue and, to the extent that I need to add further facts and details, I shall do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning. I was recently in his electorate, looking at a number of projects in relation to children. Importantly, I would like to reiterate an announcement that was made last Friday. The coalition government has provided $600,000 to the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth. For those that do not know, that is headed by Professor Fiona Stanley from the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research. This is very important research, fitting in particularly to the Treasurer's comments on budget night about the Intergenerational Report. It talks about this particular alliance getting all the best minds in the areas of early childhood, health, education, criminology, sociology and physiology to ensure that the research that is done and the policies that this government and future governments put in place for children are relevant and hit the target. I compliment the alliance for setting up the national database on early childhood research. It is all about giving parents and children a better deal. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Gellibrand, who has given bipartisan support to this issue.The member for Canning asks me whether there are any alternative policies. We certainly have not seen any alternative policies on children coming from the opposition side of the House. In many ways the current ALP is like the goldfish of Australian politics -  swimming in circles and living in three-second chunks. The only issue here is that this House is all about providing a better outcome for children. I have to say that some members of the opposition are behaving like unruly children. Is it any wonder, Mr Speaker, when you consider that the parents of the Australian Labor Party, in particular the union movement, are so upset at the moment with the change of the 60-40 rule. I have to say -  - As far as this side of the House is concerned, it is about providing children with a better future, and that is exactly what Fiona Stanley will be doing.</DOC>

It clearly demonstrates how little concern they have ever had for quarantine issues and for keeping this country free of the pests and diseases that exist around the world. When in government they neglected our quarantine services, reduced the number of quarantine staff available at airports, reduced the number of people in our post office and mail centres, and took a callous disregard -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is not in Australia's interests to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The reason it is not in Australia's interests to ratify the Kyoto protocol is that, because the arrangements currently exclude - and are likely under present settings to continue to exclude - both developing countries and the United States, for us to ratify the protocol would cost us jobs and damage our industry. That is why the Australian government will continue to oppose ratification. You cite the example of Japan. Japan is a massive energy importer; Australia is a massive net exporter of energy. One of the things that makes Australia almost unique in this context is that as a developed country we are a major net exporter of energy. The idea that you can sign up to a protocol that would facilitate the export of dirty industries from this country into developing countries and thereby facilitate the flight of jobs from this country -  - It amazes me that a Labor Party that claims, from time to time, to represent the interests of the working men and women of this country would sign up to an arrangement that would hurt this country. As with so many things - indeed as with all things - this government will continue above everything else to assert the Australian national interest. The Australian national interest does not lie in ratifying Kyoto: that is why we are opposed to it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I can advise the House that in the March quarter of 2002 the Australian economy grew at 0.9 per cent for the quarter, to a record 4.2 per cent through the year - the strongest growth of any of the major Western industrialised countries. In addition to that strong growth, inflation is low. The March quarter national accounts confirm that inflation over the course of the year was 2.5 per cent.Australia's growth was led principally by household consumption, which was very strong, reflecting good consumer confidence and low interest rates as well as additional job creation through the March quarter. Dwelling investment contributed to the growth, although the government expects that that will not continue as the housing cycle has probably peaked. Net exports made a contribution to growth. Exports were very strong in the March quarter, and I pay tribute to Australia's exporters for the work that they have done. As the world economy begins to pick up, exports should continue to pick up and contribute to growth over future quarters.The measures of wages were quite restrained with non-farm average earnings rising 3.7 per cent through the year and productivity rising 4.4 per cent. So productivity was even outstripping wage growth, which is a good sign. The profit sector was at historical highs, with profit share to GDP at 23.8 per cent. Gross mixed income was up an exceptional 11.7 per cent through the year - the highest since 1989. I just want to mention this because gross mixed income is sole traders, partners, non-corporate people, farmers and small business people. The fact that that was up 11.7 per cent - the highest since 1989 - shows that it has been quite a good year for Australia's farmers and our small businesses, and I pay tribute to them. In a time of global uncertainty and global downturn, the Australian economy remains strong. Our economic security has been tested through the last year but we have come through it in a strong position with a 4.2 per cent growth rate - the highest growth rate of any of the major Western developed countries.</DOC>

 - Today's announcement by the Reserve Bank of a rise of 25 points in relation to interest rates means that, over the last two months, interest rates have risen by 50 basis points to an official rate of 4¾ per cent. Those two rises reverse the two cuts in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attack - that is, after the terrorist attack which brought down the World Trade Centre, the Reserve Bank of Australia, like most central banks around the world, reduced official interest rates. As the world seems to have stabilised and the economic slowdown around the globe seems to have stabilised, those two cuts have been reversed. If the standard mortgage variable interest rate goes back to 6.55 per cent, as it was before 11 September, it would be the lowest variable mortgage interest rate in 30 years - as it was prior to 11 September. To give you some comparison, when the government was elected in March 1996, the home mortgage variable interest rate was 10½ per cent. That means that, notwithstanding any rise, on a $100,000 mortgage, you would be paying $330 a month less today than when this government was elected. This government was elected when the Labor Party left office with a 10½ per cent interest rate. But that is really being too kind to the Labor Party, because the average interest rate under the Labor Party was very much higher than 10½ per cent. The average interest rate under the Labor Party, I think, was over 12 per cent over its 13 years in government. - As I was saying, Mr Speaker, if the standard mortgage variable interest rate should increase to 6.5 per cent, compared to the 10½ per cent when the government was elected, the saving will be $330 a month. But if you were to average the interest rate under the Labor Party over 13 years of government, the average interest rate was 12¾ per cent. That is why we find it fascinating that the Labor Party now views 6½ per cent as something that it can try to make political capital from. I thought I would table one document just to put down the historical record. Of course, interest rates peaked under the Labor Party at 17 per cent. I have here a clipping from the Melbourne Herald of 13 July 1989, when the then president of the ACTU endorsed those interest rates. The then president of the ACTU in July of 1989 was a Mr Crean. According to the Melbourne Herald of 13 July 1989, he endorsed -  - We'll go back as far as -  - I am comparing the 6½ per cent to the 17 per cent interest rates under the Labor Party. Mr Crean, the then ACTU president, endorsed Mr Keating's line that high interest rates were the product of rapid domestic consumption. Mr Crean said:The government had to bludgeon demand out of the system through tight monetary policy.At 17 per cent! Bludgeon demand out of the system through tight monetary policy they certainly did. That was his view. An attempt to make political capital on the lowest home mortgage variable interest rate in 30 years sits so well in the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. I table that cutting.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question, because it does give me an opportunity to reaffirm - as these issues are quite frequently raised as a criticism of the government's efforts to maintain the integrity of our borders - that we are very much involved in field operations around the country to locate, particularly, visitors and temporary entrants who breach visa conditions, overstay or are found to be working unlawfully in Australia. This reflects the government's commitment to protecting our borders. At 30 June there were an estimated 60,000 overstayers in Australia. It is estimated that around half of the people who overstay their visas are working without authority. Of course, they are taking jobs that could very well be undertaken by the unemployed within our own community.My department does work with government agencies, employers, community groups and even unions to locate overstayers. In the last financial year 14,238 overstayers and people breaching visa conditions were located. If you want to know how seriously we are taking that, that effectively doubles what we saw in Labor's last year in office when the number of people located was just 7,080. - The difference is not that significant in terms of the numbers of overstayers, I might say to the honourable member. What is important is that in relation to these matters some unions have worked very cooperatively with us in some states. One of those has been the CFMEU, which identifies to us people of concern. It does so publicly on occasions. I saw that at a temple in Sydney and I have seen it recently in a church in the western suburbs of Sydney. The CFMEU has passed on information and we follow it up and it helps us considerably.But the question you have to ask yourself is why other parts of that organisation are supporting people who are unlawfully in the community, that have as their slogan `End mandatory detention and let the boats land'. This organisation is one that has harboured those who have escaped immigration detention. It is an organisation that believes that anyone who arrives unlawfully in Australia should be allowed into the community where they can take the low-paid jobs that are often used to get the unemployed back into the work force. That organisation is called the Refugee Action Collective and they boast proudly that the CFMEU in Victoria is organising their mailouts, publishing information in union journals, giving them time to speak at union meetings and providing financial support with union membership funds. The Refugee Action Collective is not about refugees; it is about people who are not refugees seeking to enter Australia to be released into the Australian community and take the very jobs that the unions say they are there to protect. That is the issue. What you need to know is that this is the same union that is supported by people like Senator Cooney and the member for Jagajaga, whose names appear on their publications. </DOC>

 - Obviously I do not have the Economist magazine with me, but I will make the point that the standard variable mortgage rate is what people pay rather than the 90-day bill rate or the 10-year bond rate.  - I can tell just from listening to the question that it is completely flawed because what you actually pay is the standard variable mortgage interest rate. Surprisingly enough, in relation to a mortgage you do not pay a 10-year bill rate. - As I have already said, in relation to official interest rates, the reversal of the two cuts post September 11 means that mortgage variable interest rates would go back to the lowest level in 30 years, at 6½ per cent. We find it strange that the Labor Party, which had an average of 12¾ per cent, believes it can make political capital out of a standard variable mortgage rate of 6½ per cent. As I said, there was never a standard variable mortgage rate with a six per cent or even with a seven in front of it under the Australian Labor Party.That is why I do not think you will be successful with this cheap attempt to try to make political capital. It is legitimate, when such a cheap attack is made, to compare records. To compare a record, I think that the average under this government has been something like 7¼ per cent compared to 12¾ per cent; or to compare a peak, under this government it was 10½ per cent when we came to office and under Labor was 17 per cent. These are the ways in which you can make these comparable assessments of economic records. Small business overdraft rates are by comparison still very low - and in an economy which is growing at 4.2 per cent. But let me just finish on this point. None of us would want a terrorist event of the order of September 11 to happen again. But when it did happen it was prudent of the Reserve Bank to take out some insurance by loosening monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve did, as the Bank of England did, as the European Central Bank did, as all the central banks around the world did. But we had hoped that, as the US economy stabilised and the world downturn started to recover, that insurance would not be a continuing necessity, as the Reserve Bank made clear in its decision today. The world economy is strengthening. That is not a bad thing for Australia; that is actually a good thing for Australia because it will mean that our exports will be stronger, our economy will grow stronger and there will be more Australians that are in jobs. That is what it is all about - a strong economy which is producing jobs for Australians. That is what the coalition government remains committed to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his strong support for the small businesses in his electorate. Let me say that the government's present efforts to exempt small business entirely from the operation of the unfair dismissal laws are our 18th attempt to keep faith with small business and to honour the mandate which has been conferred on us now three times. Eighteen times we have tried and 17 times so far members opposite have said no. If the Leader of the Opposition were serious about turning over a new leaf, if he were serious about transcending his conditioning as a born-to-rule union official, he would drop this obsession with the 50-50 rule and he would commit the ALP to getting the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small business once and for all.The member for Werriwa, the sage of Werriwa, said that oppositions can afford to be irresponsible. The Leader of the Opposition has weakly followed the Latham line on this, as on so many other issues. Oppositions can afford to be irresponsible but government cannot, not even Labor governments. The New South Wales Labor government knows that the unfair dismissal laws are hurting small business and it has announced some changes designed `to wipe out hundreds of speculative unfair dismissal claims in the New South Wales Industrial Commission each year that cost employers millions of dollars in settlements.' On this issue the New South Wales government has even been prepared to drag the unions into line. It has even persuaded John Robertson, the Labour Council chief, to admit that `the system was overloaded and at risk of a cost blow-out'. Mr Robertson claimed `that a number of unfair dismissal agents were flooding the system with hundreds of claims and charging high fees for compensation wins.'  If the Carr government can be honest about the job-destroying downside of unfair dismissal laws, why can't the Crean opposition be similarly honest? The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition is not serious about tackling union power. If he were serious about tackling union power, he would forget his obsession with the 50-50 rule and he would take a stand for the fundamental democratic principle of one vote, one value.</DOC>

 - I would have said something to that effect. I do not recall the precise words. I will be charitable with the Leader of the Opposition and acknowledge he may well be right on this occasion, although I will check it. - No, I won't be that charitable; I will check it. It is true that very strong statements have been made by the foreign minister, by the Attorney-General and others -  - And by me, and I do not walk away from that at all. Nor do I walk away from the fact that there are a number of people within the Australian community who hold views that I do not always agree with -  - They do have reservations about this. People are concerned about two things. They are concerned about bringing to the world a process that ensures that atrocities that have been committed over past decades do not remain unpunished. They are also concerned to ensure that this happens in a way that does not improperly compromise Australia's national sovereignty. What the government is endeavouring to do in its internal discussions on this issue is to reach an outcome that satisfies both of those goals. We have in past years been able to establish, through the councils of the United Nations and otherwise, bodies that on an ad hoc basis have dealt with war crimes. That applies at present in relation to many of the alleged war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia. It should also be borne in mind that the conditions precedent to the establishment of that body did involve the assertion of military force by the United States and by a number of the other NATO countries. People who imagine that the mere signature of a treaty on its own will bring about a new world order misunderstand all the experience of the 20th century. I am not going to pass up an opportunity, and the government is not, to be part of an international arrangement that will bring a greater guarantee that people are held to account for injustices and the atrocities they have committed.  - But in the process of doing that I am not going to see the national interest or sovereignty of this country compromised. That is basically what we are going to do. As with so many of the important things, this government will uphold the Australian national interest.  - The reality is that all the experience of the last hundred years ought to remind even the Leader of the Opposition that a mere signature on a treaty is not of itself a guarantee of world peace. It is not of itself a guarantee that people are going to be brought to justice. But what is a guarantee is the collective behaviour of individual nations, and we are going to continue to behave in the traditional democratic fashion of this country. I make the point that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General and others, in the remarks that have been made, have been articulating a position on behalf of the government that has had the full support of the government. We are now engaged in a process of internal consultation. I make no apologies for that. In accordance with the traditions of our two parties, we will take our time according to our processes to resolve our position, and when that occurs we will let you know.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question. I have visited the electorate of Farrer and, with the member for Farrer, I visited the world-competitive component manufacturer formerly BTR but now Global Transmissions, who are not only supplying Australian car manufacturers but exporting their product across the world. The future of the car industry in Australia is being placed in jeopardy by irresponsible union leadership and lack of leadership by the Labor Party. Since late last year industrial action by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union has cost the car industry in Australia some $400 million worth of production. The AMWU campaign has forced a temporary closure of plants and a stand-down of thousands of workers. Australia's reputation as a supplier is being put at grave risk. The AMWU is at it again. The latest incident involves illegal pickets in the steel industry which, for the last 15 days, have been impeding delivery of essential inputs. This is not the first time that steel supplies to the car industry have been threatened. The continued disruptions of supply have already prompted one car manufacturer to warn that it may be forced to take action by replacing local supplies with imported products costing Australians jobs. The CEO of Holden, Peter Hanenberger, said today:We just can't keep going on like this.Australia's car industry cannot afford this campaign. The global car industry is suffering from massive overcapacity and ruthless cost cutting. Mass retrenchments and plant closures have taken place. To date Australia has been spared from these actions. Under the Howard government's sound economic management, we have seen the car industry in Australia continue to grow, underpinned by an increase in exports now worth some $5 billion. But Australia's reputation as a supplier of first-class automobiles and a reliable supplier to the export market is being hammered into the dust by industrial action. In my discussions with car manufacturing executives in Australia and also overseas, they continue to raise as a major issue the negative impact of continuing industrial action here in Australia. It is disturbing to see that the car industry has a rate of industrial action six times the national average in terms of working days lost per employee. Where does Labor stand on this issue? With their union mates? And where does the Leader of the Opposition stand, and what is he doing? He is doing now what he did last time when he led a group of people - he is doing nothing. In 1987, when he was leader of the ACTU, what did the Leader of the Opposition do? Nothing: `Crean fails to stop crazy car dispute,' Mr Speaker. He was on the payroll of the union then -  - The Leader of the Opposition was on the payroll of the unions then and he is on the payroll of the unions now. He was under the control of the -  -  - If it assists the House, I will rephrase the statement that the -  -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw it and rephrase the statement. I have withdrawn the statement, but I will say that the Leader of the Opposition is at the beck and call of the unions and that the tentacles of the AMWU stretch right down to the frontbench of the opposition. - Thank you, Mr Speaker -  - The fact remains that the AMWU contributed $2.6 million to the ALP campaign over the last five years. If the Leader of the Opposition controls the union, I challenge him to go from this House after question time and tell Dougie Cameron and the AMWU to go back to work and save the car industry. -  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. Implied in the question is obviously that today is Wear Wool Wednesday. I had not noticed any recognition of that on the opposition benches, although I suppose there are not too many rural and regional representatives on that side of the House. -  - You are all wearing wool, are you? You will have to be a bit more explicit about it. In direct response to the question by the member for Wannon about the contribution the Australian wool industry has made to our fantastic export effort, Australia is still the world's largest wool exporter, as you would well recognise. We export 98 per cent of Australia's wool clip. Last year the wool clip was around 800,000 tonnes. In 2001 wool exports were our ninth largest export commodity. Wool contributed more than $3.5 billion to our export bottom line. Interestingly, the same amount of money in our tax reform policy was removed off the backs of our exporters in Australia - $3.5 billion was removed off the backs of Australia's exporters. Australia's wool producers earned $3.5 billion for the national economy, and they did that in a fantastic way.Today, Australia's main wool export destinations are China, Italy, Taiwan and India. Interestingly, we had in the gallery earlier some representatives from the parliament of Mexico. Mexico is one of the new wool export markets that we have established. Last week, whilst in Mexico, we got agreement from the Mexican government to remove the tariffs that had been applied to all Australian exports into that marketplace. It is important today, on Wear Wool Wednesday - hopefully many members of the opposition have Australian wool garments on, albeit not displaying the tuft of wool on Wear Wool Wednesday - to recognise wool's very important contribution to Australia's export industries. Over the years wool has been through some indifferent circumstances and some tough circumstances, a lot of the time under the rule of a Labor government, but of course at the moment it has come back to prosperity under a Liberal-National Party government. We remember the days of the disputes about the wide comb, when the shearers unions were on strike. The union involved then was the AWU. Of course, today the AWU, compared with the AMWU, is probably one of the more responsible unions - if there is such a thing - with regard to trade policy. - It is the Shorten faction; that is right. If the Australian Labor Party are going to remain dominated by the union movement, they might give 60 per cent of their attention on trade policy to the AWU - that sector led by Bill Shorten, not the union led by Dougie Cameron which we have just heard about and which is crucifying the Australian automotive industry. The Australian union movement really represent only 25 per cent of Australian workers, but they dominate 60 per cent of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. I would like to think that the humour that was supportive of her question from behind her did not relate to the seriousness of this particular issue. I said yesterday that the author of this book, Mr Mark `Chopper' Read, as he is described on the cover, had spent six years in prison for murder. In fact, according to the Herald Sun today, Mr `Chopper' Read said of my description of him as a self-confessed murderer, criminal, assailant, arsonist and torturer, `Well, he's got that right.' He went on to say:It does not mean it's the truth; it just means that I have said I've done these things.The point needs to be made that the issue here is that, as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training, on behalf of the government I have taken a stand -  - The argument and the issue here is whether or not those of us who profess to lead in education believe that a person who has been a convicted criminal and who spent more than 18 years in jail should be promoted by responsible education authorities as an author whose books should be endorsed as recommended reading in the state of Queensland for senior secondary students. If the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Minister for Education had been able to pass the commonsense test which says that this person should not be promoted as an author for recommended reading in schools, this matter would not even have been discussed in federal parliament.The point also needs to be made that a spokesman on behalf of the member for Jagajaga was reported in today's West Australian as saying that she did not support the call for the book to be removed. In the process of advising parents of what a Queensland state education authority is recommending that their students read and also recommending the virtues of an author of a book, in making sure that parents are aware of the nature of this book and publicising it through the federal Department of Education, Science and Training web site, I am trying to -  - The important point is that the Labor Party has said both in Queensland and here that it believes the decision whether their children should be reading this book in schools is one that will be made by schools and by parents. They need to understand what this book looks like. It is on our web site and it is endorsed as reading material by the Australian Labor Party and the member for Jagajaga.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and I congratulate her on her commitment to ensure that Queensland has a clean electoral roll and clean ballots. A clean electoral roll is the absolute prerequisite of a healthy democracy. However, as things stand, the electoral roll is far from rort proof. Unfortunately, as things stand, it is easier to go on the electoral roll than it is to sign up at the local video store.The government want to protect democracy and, to that end, we have tried to ensure that all new enrollees should provide some form of ID before they go on the roll. It is a simple, straightforward, innocuous change but for some reason it is too much for members opposite because, shamefully, they have rejected these proposals in the Senate. Wittingly or not, members opposite are perpetuating a rorter's charter. That is the sad truth. We have seen some extraordinary double standards recently amongst members of the Labor Party. For instance, on page 4 of the Age on 17 May, the Victorian Attorney-General attacked the federal government for wanting would-be voters to produce ID. On page 7 of the same Age newspaper, the Victorian transport minister announced legislation to give inspectors the power to demand ID off all tram commuters, allegedly to stop ticket rorts.Members opposite think that fare evasion is a worse offence than rorting the fundamental democracy upon which this country depends. What could we expect from a party which operates under the standard of anything goes? The member for Barton has just revealed that in his electorate he has a branch of 188 members from one ethnic group, of whom 77 were not on the roll. To the credit of the member for Barton, he is very much against ethnic branch stacking; but trust the caucus to produce at least one member to stand up and defend the sacred principle of ethnic branch stacking! The member for Watson was defending ethnic branch stacking in yet another flagrant act of defiance of the authority of the Leader of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition was at all serious about supporting democracy he would start by cleaning up his own party, by ending his obsession with the 50-50 rule and by supporting the fundamental democratic principle of one vote, one value.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga again for the question. The photograph of the cover of the book, which she will also notice says, `Authored by Mark 'Chopper' Read', will be removed from my web site when the Australian Labor Party is prepared to make sure that Mr Read is not promoted as a credible and legitimate role model to Australian students and in particular in the state Queensland.  -  - The Australian Labor Party has said through the Queensland government that it will leave it in the hands of schools and parents to decide whether or not Mr Read is an appropriate author to be promoted to schools, having endorsed this particular book. In order for parents to understand what exactly they are dealing with, apart from needing to know what the cover of the book is about - which actually says a lot about not only the content of the book but also its author - I should also remind the House of the seriousness of this issue for Australian parents.I refer to the joint judgment of the justices of the Full Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania in the case of Mr Mark Brandon Read v. the Queen. Mr Read was jailed at the age of 17 on two charges of assault. In 1974 he did a month in prison for being armed with an offensive weapon. Then he was also imprisoned for assaulting police. In 1975 he did six months in prison for burglary. Then for assault, impersonating a police officer, robbery: two years in prison. Then armed robbery: 12 months in prison in 1975. In 1978, for grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to two years. According to his own evidence, he shot a man with a shotgun, and in his own words, `blew his leg off'. Five weeks later he was sentenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria to 12 years in prison for the crime of abduction and at the same time to two years in prison for malicious injury. The circumstances of the abduction were that he went into a County Court of Victoria, brandishing a shotgun. Then, in order to have a friend released, he sought to abduct the presiding judge. - This criminal record goes on and on and concludes at the time when he was convicted of wilful damage and recklessly endangering life, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison on each charge - some of which was concurrent, the effective aggregate sentence for the offences being five years imprisonment. He had shot a man in the stomach and set fire to the house of another man. - Mr Read is not a man who is filled with remorse or who is doing everything he can to see that Australians live in a safer society. He is a man who is profiting on the back of his career. He is trying to use his career to promote himself and in this case to promote not only himself but his own credibility into Australian schools, aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party. It also needs to be asked, if there is not leadership shown by people in positions of authority in education to make sure that these kinds of people are not promoted as legitimate role models for young people, how we can possibly expect to live in a society a decade from now in which the right choices are made by young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for drawing attention to the fact that it is not only National Wool Day but also World Environment Day. I am happy to respond to the issues that he has raised. He is one who has taken a very keen interest in environmental issues. I am acting for Dr Kemp today because he is actually in Indonesia, where he is receiving an award from the World Wide Fund for Nature for the leadership that he is taking to preserve the planet's natural wealth. He is one of a handful of people to receive the World Wide Fund for Nature's `gift to the earth' award. I think that is an extraordinary recognition of his personal contribution to the environment. But I am sure he would be prepared to share his award with the members of the government, the members of the coalition parties, who have done so much over recent years for the Australian environment. It has been this party that has reversed the years of neglect of environmental issues under Labor. They used to talk plenty but actually deliver nothing. - It took this government to introduce the Natural Heritage Trust, which was opposed by Labor all the way along. - The volunteers working for the Natural Heritage Trust were repeatedly criticised and ridiculed by the Leader of the Opposition today for their contributions to the environment. To this day, when the Natural Heritage Trust is mentioned we hear nothing but ridicule from members opposite. The reality is that this $1.5 billion program, which on 1 July commences stage 2, adding a further $1 billion to make it $2.5 billion - provides major programs around the nation to help protect our environment. In addition, there is $1.4 billion for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. This is $4 billion towards environmental programs that Labor would never have thought of, would never have delivered. They would be standing up on World Environment Day criticising people but having no record of achievement whatsoever. But it is not just that alone; there is the commitment with communities, with the states, with local government to working towards projects under the NAP and the NHT. This government introduced a national oceans policy, one of the first in the world to have an integrated ecosystems based approach to managing our ocean resources. We have worked it to help protect threatened species, particularly in recent years in dealing with the protection of migratory fish stocks and, of course, the preservation of whales by the moratorium on whaling.The national environment protection measures that we have undertaken up the coastline represent a real demonstration of our commitment to our coastal environment. Then there is the work we have done in wetlands: eliminating weeds, feral animals and the like. This is a record of a government that really cares about the environment and which has the runs on the board. Those runs on the board are being recognised today in Indonesia, where our minister is receiving this award in recognition of this country's leadership in environmental issues. Congratulations, Dr Kemp. Congratulations to this government for its achievements on World Environment Day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and for his very strong interest in schooling and, in particular, government schools. In this year's budget, the government increased its funding to Australian schools by 6½ per cent, which takes it to $6.6 billion. - The Commonwealth government this year has increased its funding to Australian government schools by 5.7 per cent. That means that over a six-year period funding for Australian government state schools by the federal government has increased by some 52 per cent when enrolments in government schools have increased by only 1.4 per cent. It is important that honourable members understand that state government schools are funded, maintained and regulated by state governments. As the federal minister for education, I cannot even go into a state school without the permission of the state minister for education. In fact, the 69 per cent of Australian students - that is, 2.27 million students - who attend public state schools receive 78 per cent of all of the public funds that support the education of Australian students. Further to that, one million students - or 31 per cent of students - in Catholic and independent schools receive 22 per cent of the public funds.Yesterday the New South Wales government delivered its budget. Honourable members might be interested to know that in the federal budget the Howard government increased its funding to New South Wales state government schools by 5.7 per cent. Mr Speaker and honourable members, by how much do you think that the New South Wales government increased its funding for its state government schools? - You would like to think it would be about 5.7 per cent, Mr Speaker and Prime Minister, but it was not 5.7 per cent. My department advised me this morning that the New South Wales government increased its funding in its budget for its state schools by two per cent on its spending from last year. In other words, where are the missing millions? If the funding had been increased by 5.7 per cent, there would have been $202 million more available for students in New South Wales state schools. It is like the situation in Victoria: if the state government had increased its funding for its state government schools by 5.3 per cent - as we did in Victoria - instead of 2.9 per cent, there would have been $95 million more for students in Victorian state government schools. The member for Jagajaga needs to make sure that Australians understand the facts.  - The facts are that state and territory governments are primarily responsible for funding state government schools. The message to the states is: keep up with the Commonwealth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin. My response on behalf of the federal government is to say that the weakness of the Bracks government in the face of union power has cost the state of Victoria $90 million. That is my answer. Let me make it very clear - and I will table this letter at the end of this answer - that what the federal government has sought to do on this occasion is to apply in relation to the Melbourne Cricket Ground refurbishment precisely the same conditions as were applied in relation to the investment of federal funds in the Darwin to Alice Springs railway, which is a project that was initially contributed to by the CLP government of the Northern Territory and also the Liberal government of South Australia but continued and was supported with great enthusiasm by the Labor administration now in power in Darwin and the Labor administration now in power in South Australia.What we have sought to do in relation to the Melbourne Cricket Ground is to apply federal law, and federal guidelines made under that law, to the expenditure of federal money, and that is a wholly legitimate and proper thing to do. What the Bracks government have done, because they do not have the guts to stand up to the building unions in Melbourne, is cave in. The people of Victoria are going to be $90 million poorer as a result of this absolutely pusillanimous decision taken by the Bracks Labor government - this absolutely pathetic decision taken by the Bracks Labor government. There is a very, very simple principle involved. This is the practical, costly hard edge of the union's grip on the Labor Party all around Australia. This is the 60-40 rule which ripped $90 million from Victoria. Faced with a choice between agreeing to the stipulation of the Commonwealth government and standing up to the unions -  - I had several discussions with the Premier of Victoria -  - and I made it perfectly clear that what we were seeking to do was to attach the same conditions to the refurbishment of the Melbourne Cricket Ground as we attached to the construction of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway. It is also the case that the Victorian government has previously accepted application of the code and guidelines as well as the Workplace Relations Act. We were not endeavouring to impose any new unreasonable conditions; all the federal government were endeavouring to do was to say, `If you are going to spend federal money in Victoria, you spend it under federal rules and federal requirements and federal law.' It was as simple as that. But, no, when faced with a choice between standing up for the public interest and standing up to the trade union movement, the Labor Premier of Victoria has scuttled and run. He has caved in to the unions. He has sabotaged the $90 million contribution to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and, in the process, he has robbed the Victorian people of $90 million they otherwise would have got. </DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's budget reply was a complete failure. In addition, of course, to $6 billion unfunded tax credit promises, there was a new tax in relation to employee entitlements and a complete fiasco in relation to superannuation and his proposed policies. As this government put to the electorate before the election, it proposes to phase down the superannuation surcharge over three years by 1.5 per cent a year, from 15 per cent to 10.5 per cent. That was a policy which this government put to the electorate. This government was actually elected, and normally once you are elected you are entitled to put your policies into place. The Australian Labor Party believes that, having lost the election, it has the right to defeat the coalition's policies which it put out to the electorate.In a stunning piece of mathematical error, the Leader of the Opposition said that, in place of a proposal which over three years would cost $370 million, he was proposing a proposal which would cost, according to his costings, between $930 million and $1 billion - a $700 million hole. - When he was picked up about that, he said, `Oh, well, there is another part of our proposal; I just forgot to mention it in my reply.' The other part of the proposal - I do not know whether or not you are aware of this - was to abolish freedom of choice for superannuation and Commonwealth public servants. He just forgot to mention it in his budget reply. Rejection of choice and taking away public servants' right to have funded superannuation takes around another $740 million out of public servants' superannuation. That was the second leg he forgot to mention in his budget reply. We said during the election campaign that we support freedom of choice. We actually believe that public servants should have the right to have their superannuation funded, and this government will do it. - I have completed my answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House will be pleased at the labour force figures which were released today. The labour force figures showed that the rate of unemployment remained at 6.3 per cent in the month of May after the creation of 44,000 additional jobs. This means that the total number of new jobs created since the coalition government was elected in 1996 is now 972,000 new jobs.  - I think that both sides of the House will welcome the fact that 44,000 new jobs were created in the month -  - The increase in total employment was due to a substantial rise in full-time employment.  - The increase in total employment was due to a substantial rise in full-time employment - 75,300. - No, 75,300 full-time jobs in the month of May offset by a decline in part-time employment of 30,900 - an increase of 75,300. -  - Since the Labor Party interjects with `how many full-time jobs', I can answer the question - 75,300. - No. In the month of May. It is 972,000 since the Labor Party went out of office leaving an unemployment rate of 8.6 per cent. -  - I know the member for Port Adelaide is a supporter of the economic policy of the Leader of the Opposition, so I will just go over those figures again, because he seemed to be suggesting that full-time employment had fallen. In the month of May, as recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the increase in full-time employment was 75,300 offset by a fall in part-time employment, a net increase of 44,400 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.3 per cent. Let us make this clear. In Australia it is the private sector that creates jobs. We have never said that these are government created jobs; it is the private sector that creates jobs. But our government can have economic settings which are conducive to private sector profitability and increases in employment. I would have thought that all Australians would welcome the fact that employment is increasing. I would have thought that even the Labor Party would welcome the fact that employment is increasing. The most recent peak in relation to unemployment in Australia was seven per cent during the economic slowdown of last year. It compares with the peak in 1990 under the Labor government of 11.3 per cent. In fact 10 years ago the unemployment rate was above 10 per cent for 28 consecutive months. For some of that period the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. He brought it down to nearly 10 per cent unemployment. What we say about the creation of jobs has somehow now become, in the Leader of the Opposition's mind, that it is unfair to remind him of his own record.  - I know it has been a bad week but I think we are entitled -  - to remind him of his own record in relation to unemployment. Under Labor unemployment was high. In fact the Treasurer Mr Keating, some 10 years ago when he spoke of the unemployment rate above 10 per cent, said that it was the unemployment we had to have. - That is wrong, is it? It is reported in Neal Blewett's book - So it is wrong, is it? Neal Blewett would be very interested to note that. He happened to actually be there when Mr Keating made the statement and I am not sure you were there. In any event I think it is very important that both sides of Australian politics recognise the importance of creating jobs and getting unemployment down. The unemployment rate currently stands at 6.3 per cent. It is a low rate by historical standards but we can do better, and both sides of this parliament ought to commit themselves to reducing the rate of unemployment. There are three things which we need to do. One, we need to keep the Australian economy running strongly at a rate above 3½ per cent - and our budget forecasts it. Two, what Australia needs is more labour market reform. The best thing that the Australian Senate could do would be to pass the unfair dismissal laws so that one of the biggest brakes on new employment is taken away. Three, in Australia we need to reform our welfare system so that the interaction between welfare and work becomes unashamedly more pro work so that people that do have the capacity to work are encouraged to get work. This is the side of politics unequivocally interested in strong economic growth, labour market reform and welfare reform, with the end result for the people of Australia of a lower unemployment rate, more people in work and better opportunities for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. What we do know is that we have a very competent Treasurer, just from the statements that were made before about the number of jobs that were created. What he did say and what this government says is that, particularly for those that are on a disability support pension, there is going to be encouragement for them to move into some form of employment in years to come -  - and that is why we have contributed significantly more funding through this agreement. What we have done particularly in the employment assistance area, for which the Commonwealth is responsible, is to provide a significant increase in funding from $1.3 billion to almost $2 billion. What we need, though, is the Australian Labor Party to support those reforms to ensure that there is a lot more money going to assist people in employment assistance, whether it be through wage subsidies or through open employment.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and recognise the strong stance he has taken on these issues of dealing with illegal immigration. I know only too well, because Barker is adjacent to your electorate, Mr Speaker, and mine, that he is well supported there by the people of Barker, very few of whom vote for the Australian Labor Party. It is a good electorate.Yesterday afternoon I had a constructive meeting with the members of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Mr Joinet from France and Mr Ban from Hungary. The working group is undertaking a two-week visit to Australia at the invitation of the Australian government. During my discussion with in particular Mr Joinet, who did most of the speaking, Mr Joinet outlined the mandate of the working group and emphasised that its mandate was strictly confined to assessing whether or not Australia's detention policy was imposed arbitrarily as defined by the relevant international conventions. Of course, it is not imposed arbitrarily; it is imposed by law. I took the opportunity of stressing to the members of the working group that Australia's detention policy would continue to be managed in full compliance with our international legal and human rights commitments. I emphasised that detention is essential to enable appropriate health, security and identity checks to be carried out and that we would be continuing with this policy also in order to stop the flow of illegal migrants coming to our country. I was surprised to read this morning on the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald a suggestion that Mr Joinet thought Australian detention centres were the worst he had seen. I was surprised because those comments do not reflect either the words, or the tone of the meeting, I had with Mr Joinet and Mr Ban. - The minister for immigration interjects, `Nor mine.' So either the Sydney Morning Herald misreported the comments of the working group or alternatively they made these criticisms to someone else and they have been reported accurately. But I do know that when the working group had the opportunity to meet with Australian ministers these points were not made. I told Mr Joinet and Mr Ban that Australia had no intention of changing our border protection and detention policies because to do so would undermine the integrity of our orderly migration system. I was interested to see this morning, though, during the doorstop period when members and senators came into the parliament, that a leading figure in the Australian Labor Party -  - On my way to tennis indeed. A leading member of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Cook, had apparently said that `when the world body criticises us we are bound to straighten up our act'. I bring that to the House's attention because this government is a government that, through our processes of democracy and our judicial system, works out the best way to handle these difficult problems and we pursue those measures in a constructive and a fulsome way. We do not run off to the United Nations asking how Australia should be run. One of the great contrasts between the Australian Labor Party and this government is that we make our own policies. The Labor Party has no policies and goes to Geneva and asks United Nations officials in Geneva what its policies should be. It is, if I may say so, a stark contrast. This also underlines the truth of the Labor Party's position on illegal immigration and the issue of detention - that the Labor Party does not support the government's position. It went to the last election on a deception saying that it supported the government's position. I remind the House of what the member for Fremantle said straight after the election. The member for Fremantle, a leading member of the shadow cabinet, a former Premier, we remember, of Western Australia, said before the election:On several occasions, I was reassured ... that we should simply `wait until we are in government' to enunciate and implement policies consistent with our values.If ever there was a giveaway, that was it. The Labor Party does not support the government's position; the public do. The member for Brand did at the time of the last election, and it is hardly surprising that he has already moved from the back bench to the interchange bench and it will not be long before he comes to the front of the front bench. </DOC>

 - Obviously the details of the question do not fall within my portfolio -  -  - If you want to ask the right minister the question, you will get a more detailed answer. But I will make one point which does fall within my portfolio. Whatever the rights or wrongs of these issues, we will decide them ourselves, not have bureaucrats in Geneva decide them for us, unlike you who want to run off to Geneva and have a lot of United Nations officials decide these things for our country. That is the difference between you and us. You rush to Geneva and get your policies made in Geneva - we decide these things here.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that the member has a very strong personal interest in these issues, particularly in relation to Indigenous Australians and South Sea islanders whom she has introduced me to in her electorate on other occasions. But since the election in 1996 the government has shown it is committed to reducing indigenous disadvantage, and we are focusing on building the capacity of individuals and families and communities to take advantage of the opportunities for improved economic, social and cultural participation in our society here in Australia. Indigenous specific expenditure will rise to a record $2.5 billion in the year 2002--03. Much of this is targeted at health, housing, education and employment, as members would expect. It means we are spending more than $800 million more in real terms than was spent when Labor was last in office in 1994--95. We are making headway, and it is important, I think, to acknowledge the runs that are being achieved. The proportion of students going into year 12 increased from 29 per cent to more than 36 per cent between 1996 and the year 2001. The numbers in vocational education have doubled since 1995. In the year 2000, 7,000 Indigenous Australians were in higher education compared with 2,000 in 1987. Again, in 2001, some 6,000 new apprentices were engaged compared with 800 in 1994. There has been a significant improvement in infrastructure - something of the order of 39 per cent of discrete communities now have access to electricity. What we have seen is a government that is committed to raising the standard of living of Indigenous Australians so that we can have an inclusive society, one in which they are able to participate in our society as others are able to do. I read a speech last night, delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, in relation to Indigenous Australians. I very much regret that he seems to be focused only on those issues that are likely to cause division in the Australian community. Let me make it very clear. The opposition leader yesterday committed Labor to a new social justice package. What does he mean by this? - I did read the speech. Let me make it very clear: there is little to find in it about a social justice package. There was certainly some endorsement of the approach that the government is taking in relation to education, health and related matters. But the question I would ask is whether the indigenous social justice package that he is referring to is the sort of document that was proposed in the Labor Party's 1995 package, because that was a vision for separate development in Australia - a proposition that I think the great majority of Australians would not support, very clearly. That was a package that proposed a treaty, indigenous seats in the parliament, constitutional reform and institution of customary law. Those are the issues and what we need to know is where the opposition stands in relation to them. He did not raise them last night in his speech. There he was, walking down both sides of the street, talking to those particular groups in the Indigenous communities in Australia who promote these issues and essentially leaving it up in the air so that no other Australians would know what he stands for. - Yes, of course, I fronted the conference, and spelled out very positively the agenda that the government has outlined to deal with providing a decent job, good health and quality education for Australians. - Yes, it is, and it is improving very significantly. Instead of just advocating that you are following our lead, it is about time you gave active support to the initiatives that we have put in place and spent a little time working on developing policies and programs so that the Australian people know where you stand. Are you about giving indigenous seats in the parliament to Aboriginals? Are you about endorsing a form of treaty? Are you about putting separate arrangements in the Constitution for Indigenous Australians? Finally, I ask: when will you come up with a policy on these issues which all of us can read and understand?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I appreciate it. I have not rechecked those quotes but they sound familiar. The Prime Minister's advice to me, as one of his ministers, would be to make sure the quotes were accurate. It has been the cabinet's position that we would move to ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court. But I have said this for a long time: in this country there has not been an adequate process of consultation in treaty making. - When this government came to office, we - particularly the Attorney-General and I - established the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is our view that members of parliament - the democratically elected people of this country - deserve to be consulted before the executive moves to ratify treaties. That is a policy we have stuck to; we intend to continue to stick to that policy. That stands in stark contrast to what used to happen. I recall, in May 1995, my predecessor, former Senator Gareth Evans, saying, `I do not favour subjecting treaties to the vagaries of parliament.' That was the view of the previous foreign minister. The view of the present foreign minister is that our parliamentary parties should be properly consulted before we move not to sign but to ratify treaties. Entirely relevant to this, I was browsing through Don Watson's book Recollections of a Bleeding Heart, which I hope members have been reading. In that book, there is discussion about Mr Keating negotiating the secret treaty with Indonesia towards the end of 1995. I quote Don Watson's words from that book: When it was suggested on the way back that the Australian people might not see the significance of the agreement with Indonesia and might even resent it, the Prime Minister snarled at their ingratitude.If we had a government and a Prime Minister who snarled at the ingratitude of the Australian people when treaties were signed, that would undermine the credibility and the support of our international relations amongst the Australian people. We stand firmly behind our policy on treaty ratification.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note his real interest in these matters, particularly in relation to the F3, a very high-quality but now relatively old piece of Australian infrastructure that increasingly faces challenges in the future. There has been a very strong and positive response from the transport industry to the AusLink initiative. I am also aware of the Labor Party's reaction to AusLink as a plan. It is a bit difficult to determine what these comments mean about opposition policy because they have been so totally confused. On 22 May, the day after I announced AusLink, the member for Batman welcomed it. He was quite glowing - he said, `At last I have seen the light.' In fact, he said I had adopted a Labor Party policy. Those were his words. But on Monday of this week, while I was temporarily out of the country, in Samoa, representing Australia at the 40th anniversary of their independence -  - I like them. I think they are very kind and big-hearted people. While I was there, the member for Batman rose in the grievance debate and attacked AusLink as irresponsible and at odds with Labor policy. In the second last week of May, AusLink was a Labor Party policy, but in the first week of June the completely same policy was not Labor Party policy. The member for Batman needs to make up his mind about AusLink. He has probably been a little distracted lately. I note that he has been referred to in the media as one of the Leader of the Opposition's key advisers. So, probably obeying the 60-40 rule, he has been spending 60 per cent of his time advising the Leader of the Opposition on how to do better in this place, and spending only 40 per cent on transport policy. With any good luck, he will support a move to the 50-50 group, because then he can spend 50 per cent of his time thinking about transport policy, and that might be a real improvement. - It is relevant. The point is that Labor has missed the point about transport planning. That is the point. On Monday night the member for Batman said:... the national highway system, by its very nature, is, and should be, a Commonwealth responsibility. In the same manner, the states and local government have clear responsibilities.In other words, he is saying that the Commonwealth should be constrained to the current policy arrangements. The Commonwealth should have 100 per cent funding responsibility for the national highway systems, the states should accept responsibility for arterial roads, and local governments should look after local roads. That is not a policy for the 21st century; it is a policy for the last century. We know the member for Batman is very conservative. He is a very conservative ex-ACTU chief who believes in the 60-40 rule, who believes in the last century's transport policies and who certainly believes in class warfare. But the fact is that what needs to be said at the moment is that we need a way to plan transport for the future. Last century's plan will not work. The member for Batman has rejoined us. His very proposal that we ought to stay with the old arrangement will entrench our inability to do what we need to do to develop -  - The fact is that the very proposition that the member for Batman puts forward, which in his conservative frame of mind is that we ought to stay with the old approach, precludes the very thing that is so needed for this country: the planning flexibility to develop a model that is going to work to help us to cope with the challenges of the future.There are a couple of other points that need to be made. The member for Batman would have us believe that we have failed in terms of our responsibilities to the national highway system. It is worth noting that the 2001 infrastructure report card from the Institution of Engineers Australia gives a pass to just one major piece of road infrastructure in Australia. Which one is it? It is the one that runs around the nation, that we planned, built and fund. That is the one that passes. The state roads administered by his colleagues around the country are identified as failing right across the nation. They do not get a pass mark from that highly regarded body, the Institution of Engineers Australia. They rate a failure for state roads and have a very poor rating for local roads. We of course are helping there because that is rightly recognised as a national transport priority. The member for Batman challenges me to be forthright. He claims that we are going to scrap and reduce funding for a whole range of road programs to which we have committed ourselves and I have repeatedly said that we are not going to do that. We will meet all commitments before the introduction of a new system. In conclusion, the institute's report notes that: The lack of a national integrated transport strategy has been recognised as inhibiting the efficient and equitable distribution of funding for and the prioritisation of roads.That of course is exactly what Auslink is designed to do.</DOC>

 - As today's figures show, over the past five years 447,000 full-time jobs have been created. As today's figures show, over the past five years 440,000 part-time jobs have been created. This is a great result for Australia which has come about in part because of the policies of this government, but largely thanks to the diligence of Australian workers and the drive of Australian managers. They deserve the gratitude of all Australians.As the member for Flinders well knows, strikes cost jobs. Right now at Westernport, 228 members of the AMWU are jeopardising the livelihoods of 50,000 Australian workers in the car manufacturing industry. Holden have said that they will be forced to shop overseas for car components if this strike wave does not stop. The car component industry is at the heart of manufacturing in this country and there are car component companies in just about every electorate in Australia. For instance, there are 800 car component workers in the electorate of Ballarat. There are 500 in the electorate of Bass. There are 110 in the electorate of Batman. There are at least 250 in the electorate of Blaxland. There are 750 in Calwell, 400 in Chisholm, 300 in Gellibrand, 200 in Greenway, 100 in Holt, 550 in Isaacs, 800 in Kingston, 850 in Melbourne Ports, 500 in Port Adelaide, 250 in Scullin and at least 500 workers in car component manufacturing in the electorate of Hotham whose jobs are now at risk because of the wildcat strikes of the AMWU. All those members of parliament should be sending a very clear message to the AMWU: `Stop sabotaging the jobs of people in my electorate.' I don't think any of them are going to do that? Why? Because the Leader of the Opposition has never seen a strike that he did not support. Let's face it: he cannot afford not to support the strikes. The AMWU has given $3 million to the Labor Party over the last six years. It has sent Senator George Campbell to Canberra to look after its interests and Senator Campbell has put the Leader of the Opposition on 12-months notice. He has put him on 12-months probation. Elements of the AMWU are now in cahoots with the Storemen and Packers Union to deny Bill Shorten the presidency of the Victorian ALP, and haven't the phone lines been running hot between Greg Sword and Simon Crean -  - Fifty thousand jobs in the car industry are now at risk because of the rogue actions of this union; this union which is currently in cahoots to deny Bill Shorten the Victorian ALP presidency. - I am supporting the jobs of 50,000 workers in the car industry, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who is in cahoots with Greg Sword to rat on the right -  - If the Leader of the Opposition was serious about protecting jobs and creating jobs he would support measures like exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws, he would give up his obsession with the 50-50 rule and he would commit himself to the fundamental democratic principle of one vote, one value. This government is serious about jobs. Nearly one million of them have been created since 1996, whereas the only job that the Leader of the Opposition is interested in is the job of the Victorian ALP presidency and he is trying to rat on Bill Shorten.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and acknowledge her very strong representation in this place on behalf of the 500 auto workers that reside in her electorate. She takes seriously her responsibility of protecting their jobs - unlike those sitting on the other side - as do I, with the 300 or 400 auto workers that operate in my electorate whose jobs are now being put at risk by the Australian Labor Party and their friends in the ACTU and the AMWU in Victoria.The member for Makin asked what contribution the auto sector makes to Australia's overall export performance. I can inform the House that it is quite considerable. Last year, $4.9 billion worth of export earnings came from the Australian auto sector, in both fully built up cars that are exported to the world and components - an even split between the two sectors of the industry. They generate many thousands of jobs for Australians. Auto exports are now one of Australia's top 10 exporting sectors. With the policies that have been implemented by our government the industry is set to grow dramatically, and we have seen significant growth over the last six years. Indeed, our auto exports are performing so well that last month Toyota Australia announced its 200,000th export of the locally produced Camry to the Middle East. Early next year, Holden, notwithstanding any more strikes in Victoria, will begin exporting the Monaro to the United States of America. Selling cars to America is like selling ice to the Eskimos. That is a clear indication of not only the relationship that exists between Australia and the United States but also the high standards that the Australian export industry has achieved.It was interesting to note yesterday that in a debate in this place the member for Rankin detailed his 2020 vision for industry in the future of Australia. He outlined what he wants to see in 20 years time - not just next year or the year after in Australia but in 20 years time - with regard to the economy being innovative, highly skilled, high waged and producing high value goods. But he left one thing out: we need to be internationally competitive, as we are today. We cannot expect the Australian auto industry to remain internationally competitive when it is being dogged with the burden of strikes that it has had in the course of the last 12 months. These strikes damage our international reputation. They threaten international investment in this industry in Australia. There is the opportunity for significant international investment in this industry in Australia, and they put that at risk. Most importantly, these strikes that have been referred to threaten the jobs of many thousands of Australians in our electorates as well as the electorates of the Australian Labor Party. It is a pity that the Australian Labor Party would not take their responsibilities more seriously in this regard. But this is not the first strike to hit the car industry. It is not the second strike. It is actually the third. It is the third crippling strike -   - that has been started by the AMWU -  - led by Doug Cameron. All he is after is more control to the union movement, more control of the Australian Labor Party through this action. The minister earlier mentioned that Holden have indicated - and it was in this morning's Herald Sun - that they may have to look for component suppliers offshore, because they cannot put at risk the export markets that they have developed for Australian products if these strikes continue. Peter Hanenberger said yesterday that it was not a path the company wanted to take but its manufacturing base and export push was under pressure. It is under pressure from the union movement in Australia, aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party. It is about time the Australian Labor Party started reciprocating and exercising 60 per cent control over the union movement in the same way the union movement exercises control over the Australian Labor Party. There is a challenge for the Leader of the Labor Party: see if you can reciprocate that control that you stand from the Australia union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and acknowledge that we on this side realise most clearly that most people who come to this country through the migration system are, naturally enough, afforded the status they deserve. They have satisfied our reasonable requirements on their character, on their health and on security matters, and they are afforded a great welcome. Australians are good at welcoming people from a diverse range of cultures into our community and we work hard at it. So it is astonishing always when we find some people in leadership roles in the community who go out of their way to create division, who make divisive comments, who try to highlight any passing difficulties in a way to try and make people feel most unwelcome.This is all about leadership. It is all about the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition and trying to get him to bring his party ranks around the country into some form of reasonable, constant view on the matters to do with important issues such as detention policy. I have a letter sent by 53 members of the African refugee community in Brisbane, people who have not been in Australia for a long time but have been in Australia long enough to know troublemakers when they see them. This letter says, in part:We wish to express our disappointment that certain state and council politicians used the African and Latin American festival at Annerley in Brisbane as a platform for pro-Labor political speeches. These 53 African refugee community members also said:We feel this was a contradiction of the spirit of the festival. The African and Latin American festival was meant to foster multiculturalism through a celebration of togetherness. - These people are rightly angry at the way the Australian Labor Party attempted to hijack this festival. They turned it into a pro-Labor political campaign rally. At this function, Anna Bligh - we have heard a lot about Anna Bligh this week - the Queensland Minister for Education; Matt Foley, the Queensland Minister for Employment, Training and Youth; and the Brisbane City Council Deputy Mayor, Councillor Quinn, politicised this community celebration by making speeches against the Commonwealth government's policy on detention. This is a policy that is supported by the Leader of the Opposition, we think, and it is a policy that is also supported by the Queensland Premier, we think, but we have got two senior members of the Queensland government cabinet going against their Premier behind his back. Anna Bligh said that she was personally disgusted at the federal government's failure to roll out a welcome mat to illegal immigrants. They are completely at odds with the public statements made by Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition, and also by Premier Beattie.This is important because the six million migrants who have come to Australia legally through the correct channels understand clearly the need for the strong policies we have on national security and detention. This is important because even those who have come to this country as refugees, who have waited their turn and come through the system do not want their status - the value they have in Australian citizenship and participation in the Australian community - undermined by illegal queue jumpers. These people, rightly, expected some consistency and some leadership from the Labor Party, but of course the Australian Labor Party are completely out of control on this issue. They have seriously misjudged the sentiments of the nation-building aspirations of migrants through the various categories that have come to this country. They have completely misunderstood, and misunderstood in every possible way, the aspirations of emerging communities -   - such as the African community. - The interjections from those opposite prove that division is rife. As far as the Labor Party are concerned, there are nine different policy positions on detention matters. They are totally irrelevant to modern Australia. They have no ideas. They went to the last election with no multicultural policy. Any wonder they cannot possibly keep up with what is occurring. They are divided and divisive. - The member for Griffith proves just how divided the Labor Party are on this issue. - Just last weekend, he was talking at the Labor Party state conference, and they now call him around Brisbane `Kevin Ruddock' because he is apparently out there defending the policy. At the end of the day, as the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs moving around cultural communities, I have no doubt in my mind that the greatest threat to community harmony which exists in Australia today, as evidenced by the refugee community in Brisbane, is the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As to the first part of the question, I will have a look at the map. The question allows me to point out something that we on this side of the House have always believed and that is that Labor is weak on border protection. That is the reality. - It defies all logic that the Labor Party, having supported the act of parliament under which this regulation has been made, would now change its position, and the only thing that has intervened has been a federal election. If it was all right to excise Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island and if it was all right to see the enormous benefits in terms of the deterrent effect of that policy, why isn't it, in the face of the evidence made available to the Leader of the Opposition, okay to excise these further islands? The only thing that has changed is that the Leader of the Opposition is under heat from his own party and he is going weak at the knees. He is going very, very weak at the knees. We in this parliament, with the support of the opposition, passed an act of parliament last year which not only excised Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef but also gave authority for the minister, by regulation, to excise further islands. The Leader of the Opposition supported it last year but he is opposing it this year. He is going weak on border protection. He has been rolled by the New South Wales -  - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is going to water on border protection. The reason he is doing that is that the Labor Party have never really believed in a strong border protection policy. They went through the last election parading this fiction that there was only a tissue paper between our policy and theirs. The then Leader of the Opposition would stand up and say, `The government and the opposition are shoulder to shoulder on strong border protection policy.' That strong border protection policy has meant that there have been no boat arrivals over the last six months. So that policy having worked, what has the Leader of the Opposition now set out to do? He has set out to undermine it, and he wants to undermine it because he does not believe in a strong border protection policy. The Australian people know which side of politics believes in protecting its borders and it is certainly not the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I notice that the reaction of members of the opposition is to laugh at the suggestion that Australia might have a free trade agreement with the largest economy the world has ever seen. Yet that is an indication of just how seriously this government takes the national interests of this country. I can report to the parliament that the current position regarding the negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States is that in order to negotiate any further trade agreements the administration requires trade promotion authority from the American Congress. The current indications are that that trade promotion authority, if it is to be granted, is likely to be granted over the next two to three months. It is then clear from the discussions I had, both with President Bush and also with the US trade representative, Mr Zoellick, that once that trade promotion authority has been granted then I believe that negotiations with the United States will begin. I want to make it very clear that the challenge of negotiating a free trade agreement with the United States is very formidable indeed, and it is important that everybody who would like to see this outcome achieved maintain realistic expectations. The benefits of a free trade agreement with the US would be immense and they would be of enduring economic benefit to this country. The United States is the largest economy in the world and if a properly based free trade agreement could be concluded that would be of very great benefit to the Australian economy. But, in the course of negotiating the free trade agreement, I want to make it clear that the interests of Australian farmers will not be betrayed in any way by this government.It remains the view of this government, as I indicated in my address to Congress, that the United States farm bill has done great damage to Australian farmers. Not only has it done great damage to Australian farmers; but it ignores the reality that Australian farmers are extremely efficient producers. It also ignores the reality, as do the trading policies of the European Union, that the impact of those trading policies on the developing countries of the world is quite devastating. Indeed, if those trading barriers were removed, the benefits to developing countries would be at least three times the benefits of foreign aid delivered by the developed countries of the world to developing countries. If the opportunity arises, we will enter into negotiations with the United States government, but it will be on the basis of protecting the proper interests of Australian agriculture and it will be against the background of recognising that we should have realistic expectations.I take the opportunity of also informing the House that during the time that I was in the United States I had an opportunity not only to talk to President Bush but also to talk to the Vice-President, Mr Cheney; the Secretary of State, Mr Powell; the Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage; the Commerce Secretary, Mr Evans; the National Security Adviser, Condoleeza Rice; the head of the CIA -  -  - I know the Labor Party finds all of this extremely uncomfortable. We had a barrage of noise from the Labor Party as soon as I rose to my feet. That indicates to me that it was not a bad visit. If it had been a bad visit, we would not have had that barrage of noise from the Labor Party. It was a good visit. You were right; your perception is correct. The Australian Prime Minister on this occasion was afforded a level of access that has never been exceeded by a former Prime Minister of Australia.</DOC>

 - It is a measure of the desperation of the Labor Party on this issue that they are reaching back to invoke wartime references to the Brisbane Line. I want to make it clear that there is no intention - and there never has been - to excise any part of the Australian mainland. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition. You cannot escape the rub - you voted for something which you are now trying to destroy. It is as simple as that. Last year it was okay to excise Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island but this year, with the election behind you, with the hot breath of the state conferences of the Queensland and New South Wales ALP breathing down your neck, you are now buckling at the knees. You are going to water, as we always knew you would, on border protection.  The Australian people have a very clear situation in front of them: on the one hand, they have the Liberal and National parties who believe in strong border protection; on the other hand, they have an Australian Labor Party who, for political expediency, will pretend in an election campaign that they support us but who, with the election campaign behind us, are prepared to do everything they can to send a green light to the people smugglers. What the Labor Party are doing is sending a message to the people smugglers that they have cracked the bipartisan wall.  - The bipartisan border protection wall is being undermined and cracked by the actions of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. The action announced by the minister last week was taken under an act of parliament that the Australian Labor Party voted for. They voted for this. No matter how much they now protest, interject and obfuscate, nothing can alter the fact that, under the leadership of the member for Brand, the Australian Labor Party voted for this measure. The regulation was made by the minister under an act of parliament that was voted for by the Australian Labor Party. That can lead to only one conclusion, and that is: Labor are weak on border protection. Labor are weak on border protection. That sends a very clear signal to the Australian public and to the world that, if you want strong border protection laws in this country and if you want consistency in the national interest, never trust the Australian Labor Party because, when there is a bit of pressure applied to an Australian Labor Party leader, that leader will buckle at the knees, he will go to ground, he will go to water, he will cave in and he will flash a green light not to the interests of the Australian public but to the interests of international people smugglers. Labor are weak on border protection. That is the clear message coming out of this disgraceful backflip by the Australian Labor Party on an important piece of national policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I might simply observe that, if you had read the legislation, you would be aware that excision only operates in relation to external territories and islands. As to the question of whether or not people want to get you into the game of saying, `Will you rule this one in or that one out?', I was not going to go down that route and I make that very clear. It is only a matter of reading the legislation and understanding it. Let me make the point that you need to have a comprehensive approach to dealing with people-smuggling issues. That is a point that we have always made, and we have been dealing with countries in our region to put in place a range of measures to enable us to work with them on dealing with these questions. Only as recently as last week, the Minister for Justice and Customs was in Indonesia signing further agreements dealing with cooperation on those matters. The fact is that it is nothing new to talk about getting cooperation from other governments. It is not some new, remarkable discovery; it is something that we have been working on consistently over a long period of time. What I do remember is the piece of advice I got from a minister in Indonesia about the difficulties they have in dealing with some of these questions. It is not a first order issue for them. He said to me, `Minister, what are you going to do about the sugar?' What he was saying was: `What are you prepared to do about those issues that are in your hands and that you are able to deal with?' That is what he was saying, and it was a pretty compelling point.  - It was a pretty compelling point, and that is something that the Leader of the Opposition needs to understand, because what he was referring to was the relative advantage that you obtain if you are able to reach Australia, Australian territory or some of our islands, and you are within the migration zone, and you are able to lodge a valid application for protection in Australia. That gives you a very significant advantage in terms of the support that you are able to receive and the benefits that you might be able to access if you can get through an asylum system that gives you what I today call `convention plus'. It is a convention that is interpreted far more liberally and widely in Australia and which gives people benefits if they obtain a presence in Australia, our territories or any of our offshore islands which is an advantage over those who are waiting patiently to be reassessed anywhere else. The fact is that the excision recommendations to the government in relation to the offshore islands between Exmouth and the Torres Strait and into the Coral Sea were made on recommendation by the People Smuggling Task Force. It was in the light of information that was given to us, some of which was published in the Indonesian press - and that has been made known - and some of which has been otherwise reported to us, that it is quite clear that people smugglers are still active in Indonesia. There are of the order of 2,500 people that might be able to traffick and ply representations that they can aid and assist them. There are people still active in trying to put together boats to travel to Australia and beyond. The advice was very clear: people were now looking at arranging for vessels to travel beyond Australia and into the Pacific. Indonesia was the subject of a recent information campaign conducted by New Zealand warning against people trying to travel by sea to New Zealand. The fact is that people are very exercised about the way in which people might be intent on travelling beyond Australia. The route they would most likely travel is through the Torres Strait where there are many islands and reefs. The expectation is that vessels in very poor circumstances might well founder near some of those islands or might run aground on a reef. They may reach an island and, in doing so, enter the migration zone and obtain the advantages that that brings rather than the disadvantage that occurs if they land on Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef or the Cocos Islands. So there was very clear advice that this was the most appropriate way to deal with what was seen as a new risk arising from changed circumstances. It was something which was in our hands to deal with and something that would be useful and effective as a deterrent in ensuring that the range of measures that we have already put in place were able to operate effectively. That is the nature of the advice that the government received and I believe -  - I was not present at the briefing but I believe you would have been advised. We have now what I see as an emerging pattern from the opposition. This is not just disallowance of this measure, which would clearly be very important in dealing with people who are intending to try and travel beyond Australia, it is a pattern that is emerging because we had the member for Lalor out there arguing that those people, who have been found not to be refugees and who have no need for protection, ought to be brought to Australia and granted safe haven, unlike the Kosovars who were brought here lawfully as refugees. She is arguing that people who are not refugees ought to be brought to Australia to send a very clear signal that they had obtained an outcome in Australia to which they would not have otherwise been entitled. Then we have the further statements that were made. She had this to say: We will be making further policy statements on processing and on the future of mandatory detention. What she is saying is, `Let the children out.' - The only point I will make - and I will conclude on this point - is that there is a pattern of statements emerging clearly intended to undermine the suite of measures that we have put in place, which are working and which have obtained very important outcomes for the benefit of Australia. What the opposition are saying is: `We are about unwinding each of those measures as we get the chance and the opportunity.' </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because it gives me the opportunity to make a number of important points about what I consider to be a slur on my department. I have had the opportunity of reading the Auditor-General's report. I found little original thought in it. What I did find -  -  - Let me make it very clear that, where it makes recommendations, it makes recommendations to the department that it should follow up on initiatives that it has already introduced. Let me say something about its performance. The fact is that the performance of my department in relation to boat arrivals is that we have been able to deal very effectively with what was a very major problem. As for the performance of my department in relation to air arrivals, we have seen the numbers of people arriving unlawfully declining. There may have been some justification for arguing that our performance was wanting if you had seen the numbers going up over time, but those numbers, over time, were coming down. That indicates to me a department that is effective in relation to dealing with those issues.Let me make one final point: I do not mind people drawing attention to the fact that there are other people who from time to time overstay visas, or drawing to my attention that there are some people who breach visa conditions by working when they have no authority. But let me say that in relation to those numbers there has been no significant change in the number of people unlawfully in Australia in the time that I have been the minister or the time that these figures were collected under Labor. Let me make it very clear that there has been no significant change in those figures over all that time. But where there has been a significant change - I will check the figures for preciseness, but indicatively they were of this order - each year we locate and detain about 14,000 people who breach visa conditions or overstay. When you were last in office fewer than half that number were located. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina and acknowledge the strong representation she has made on the issue of illegal migration. It particularly reflects the nature of her own electorate, to which many migrants have gone over many years - people who want a fair go for people through the legitimate system and not to see people come through the back door and cheat the system. I met with President Harris on Friday, and officials from AusAID met with him on Thursday. We had a very constructive meeting, as did the AusAID officials. We essentially discussed two things. First of all we discussed the aid program to Nauru, which is on track. We have been doing our best to help Nauru through a difficult time. - The Leader of the Opposition, who wanted to set higher parliamentary standards, mocks the proposition of helping Nauru. He mocks assisting Nauru and providing fuel so that the people of Nauru can have fresh water. That is a joke for the Leader of the Opposition and it says something about the base standards that he sets for the Australian Labor Party. Not only is he weak but he is base in his approach. The aid program is on track. What is more, President Harris is happy with, and understands the program put forward for, the processing and eventual departure from Nauru of asylum seekers and those who are found to be refugees. This government very much appreciates the cooperation with Nauru on this issue. Nauru is one of many countries that have worked closely with Australia in addressing the issue of people-smuggling. So too have the Indonesians and the East Timorese - two countries that participated at the Bali people-smuggling conference which was cochaired by Australia and Indonesia. Any suggestion that this government has not built strong cooperation in the region on this issue is manifestly false, as demonstrated by the success of the Bali people-smuggling conference and the many initiatives that have been taken since then in East Asia, in the Pacific and indeed in some of the source countries.The honourable member for Riverina asked whether there were any alternatives. It is worth reflecting on the alternative put forward by the Labor Party. Six days before the last federal election the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, said, `The ALP will persist with the Pacific solution.' That was in the days when the Labor Party was trying to tell voters, `Vote for Labor and you will get the same policy on this issue as the coalition would deliver.' That is how a lot of people sitting on that side managed to be re-elected. A lot of people would not be on that side of the House if they had not made that commitment. In September the current Leader of the Opposition said:... look you're the government of the day - referring to us - you've got to make the calls but ... importantly, we're prepared to offer you support.Of course he said that just before the election. The volte-face that the Labor Party has done since the election is a betrayal of the people who voted for Labor at the last election and it illustrates a great deception of the Australian people at the election. Deceived the people may feel but angry they will certainly feel over the bonus - the opportunities - that the Labor Party now offers to people smugglers. Labor has put up a sign for the people smugglers, saying, `Welcome back into business.' Labor's message is to give the people smugglers an opportunity to start their trade again after this government successfully closed it down for six solid months. Labor is weak on border protection, and that will not pass the attention of the people smugglers.</DOC>

 - I simply make the point again: if the premise upon which you draw your conclusion is flawed - and it was - the fact is that the number of passengers refused entry at airports has dropped and is dropping, and that has been the case. - I simply make the point in relation to these matters that the facts speak for themselves. The numbers of people arriving without authority by air each year have been dropping at a time when we would have expected them to rise significantly. The expectation was that people would transfer from boats to air and it has not been realised. It is a flawed view if you are suggesting that the department has failed in relation to these matters when you look at the objective data.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics has released the data from the 2001 census. On the basis of that census, the statistician has estimated that as of December last year Australia's population had reached 19,603,000. Seventy-two per cent of Australians identified themselves as having been born in Australia and over 200 different ancestries were reported, with Australian being the greatest, followed by English, Irish, Italian, German, Chinese, Scottish and Greek. The member for Herbert will be interested to know that 183,290 people are normally resident in Townsville, confirming that it is the largest town in North Queensland. The last election confirmed that it is the best represented town in North Queensland as well.The results of the census confirm that the fertility rate continues to decline and life expectancy continues to increase. The median age of Australians in 2001 was 35 years, up from 34 years in the 1996 census. The proportion of Australians aged 65 years and over increased by half a percentage point, and the proportion of Australians aged 14 years and under fell by 0.8 per cent during the same period. - The point, as the Intergene-rational Report found, is that Australia's population is ageing and that means that a government must put into place changes now to secure the future for future generations. And it is not the cheapjack opportunism of the Australian Labor Party which will do it. Here we are with a government which is prepared to put in place measures which will stabilise the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Does the Australian Labor Party have an alternative policy? No. Cheapjack opportunism, led by the greatest political opportunist in modern Australian history - the Leader of the Opposition. This is a person whose previous ministers have said he used to boast before the election that there was not a cigarette paper between him and the government on border protection. He needs some defence. I would get up quickly.  - Mr Speaker, the census showed that Australia's population is ageing. As the Intergenerational Report said, this is going to put particular pressure on such things as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the age pension and social welfare expenditures. In relation to stabilising those schemes, can I make this point: it is the side of politics that is interested in making those schemes sustainable which is going to ensure quality health care for Australians in the future. Cheapjack opportunism will not ensure that Australians in the future have the kinds of opportunities that they aspire to. That is why it is one side of politics that leads and the other side of politics that is cheapjack and opportunist in Australia.The census also indicated that Australians are high users of technology, confirming that almost eight million Australians had used a personal computer in the week before the census was conducted and that around seven million, or 36.7 per cent, accessed the Internet over the same period. It is those sorts of changes, as we take them into all of the industries of Australia, that have given Australia the productivity boost in the latter part of the 1990s that strengthened our economy, along with macroeconomic changes. I want to thank the people of Australia who participated in this Bureau of Statistics census. Australia leads the world in relation to statistics and the collection of statistics. Our bureau is second to none in the area. This will give us the tools with which to devote policy attention and to lay down long-term planning for the future of the Australian public - planning that we want to see: better health and aged care opportunities and better productivity opportunities for the decades which are to come.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I regret to inform the House that last week the motor industry faced its third shutdown in just 12 months because of industrial action by ultramilitant unions led by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. The AMWU and its allies put on a blockade of BHP's Western Port plant. They did this despite a Federal Court injunction and they did it despite graphic warnings by both Ford and Holden that they would be forced to shop overseas for components if this kind of industrial disputation continued.When officials of Ford in Detroit began their weekly conference with officials of Ford Australia last week they started off with the question: `What's new in strike country?' This is the spectre now haunting the motor industry in Australia because at almost the same time the Assistant Secretary of the AMWU in Victoria was threatening to paralyse no fewer than 500 car component firms. Last week, while the jobs of 50,000 Australian workers were under threat, the Leader of the Opposition was working the phones to union officials in Victoria trying to get them to rat on Bill Shorten, but he would not pick up the phone once to try to stop them ratting on the jobs of 50,000 fellow workers. Last week the Leader of the Opposition gave five major interviews without mentioning the threat to 50,000 Australian workers' jobs by a union which has given $3 million to the ALP in the last few years and which has the largest single bloc vote inside the Victorian ALP. Three million dollars may not always buy Labor's support, but it always buys their silence. In fact, the only frontbencher who had the guts and decency -  - The only Labor frontbencher who had the courage and the decency to talk about the threat to jobs last week was - and good on him for this - the member for Barton, who said that union officials who talk up class conflict are lunatics. He said that the officials talking up class conflict were lunatics. What does that say about a political party which is fundamentally based on the notion of class conflict and still has as its official policy the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange? When will the Leader of the Opposition have the guts to drop the socialisation objective and -  - The workers in the car industry want to know when the Leader of the Opposition will drop his obsession with the 50-50 rule and change the 100 per cent rule, which says that every single member of the Labor Party has got to be a member of a trade union.</DOC>

 - First let me say that, when this government came to office, it said it would not do what the Labor Party had done. We said that we would not go off and sign treaties and conventions without consultation, including with the parliament. That is a process that we put into place -   - and I was one of the two ministers who put that process into place. As far as the International Criminal Court is concerned, it is well known that not only have I been a longstanding supporter of it but I was one of the ministers who participated at the original Rome conference and I worked very hard on putting the statute together. The government will make a decision on how to take this issue forward, as a result of consultation. That is precisely the process we put in place back in 1996. It is an appropriate process and it stands in stark contrast to the arrogant disregard for the parliament and the public shown by the Labor Party in government when it came to treaties and conventions. It is as simple as that. - Many countries - I think 25, 26 countries - in the process of ratifying this treaty have made -  -  - Sixty-seven have ratified and about 25 or 26 of those countries have made statements at the time of ratification. It is a procedure that has been used by a number of countries. Whether this country would do such as thing or not is all part and parcel of the process of discussion and consultation -  - something that is anathema to the trade union party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and acknowledge his significant interest in the interests of the auto workers in his electorate and, indeed, throughout Melbourne. It is an interest I share. In my electorate of Lyne, I have about 350 auto workers in the component industry. But this is unlike some of the members on the other side, who do not seem to care much for the jobs of the auto workers in Australia. For example, the member for Hotham has 520 jobs in the auto sector in his electorate, the member for Batman has 110, the member for Kingston has 823 and the member for Melbourne Ports has 850. These members of the Australian Labor Party - that is dominated to a large extent by the Australian union movement - have been silent on a number of industrial disputes, and the latest is an illegal picket of BHP in Melbourne over the last 12 months or so.We had the Tristar dispute, we had the Walkers dispute and just recently we have had the BHP dispute. Yes, it seems it may have been resolved ultimately through the courts but, following that, Doug Cameron, the real master of the Labor Party, is saying that these disputes are going to continue. He is flagging that these disputes are going to continue and so it is going to put at risk the reputation of the Australian automotive sector - 50,000 jobs that are sustained by over $5 billion worth of exports as well as the domestic market. This spate of strike action is forcing Australia's car manufacturers, ashamedly, into sourcing parts and products overseas. You only have to look at the newspapers last week - the Australian on Friday said, `We will buy foreign parts.' What an outrageous notion for an auto sector that has just -  - What an outrageous notion for an industry that has achieved $5 billion worth of exports - to be held to ransom by the bloody-mindedness of the union movement in Australia, when what it is all about is an internal brawl for power, ultimately not just to control the Victorian union movement but to control the Australian Labor Party. That is what this fight is all about. We read headlines, like the minister mentioned a while ago, saying that in Detroit they are calling Australia `Strike Country'. The president of Ford Australia said: ... we don't need to buy this steel in Australia any more. And if we move to buy it overseas it will never, ever, come back.What a sad situation. I just want to draw to the House's attention that, a couple of months ago, when the US announced that they were going to put tariffs on imported steel, including Australian steel, I had Sharan Burrow, Doug Cameron and Bill Shorten banging on my door saying, `Government, we want to participate in this steel summit. Government, we demand you do something about these steel workers' jobs.'We had a steel summit. We included, in good spirit and good nature, representatives from all those levels of the union movement. We had the member for Cunningham and the member for Rankin try to crash that meeting. They put on this amazing stunt with the television cameras outside on the steel dispute, but we have not yet seen any stunt down at the BHP factory with the unions that have been blockading that factory for the last month. There has been no stunt by the member for Cunningham and no stunt by the member for Rankin to assist the workers in that industry or the Australian auto workers.The union movement came and demanded that this government do something, and we did. We freed up 85 per cent of our exports. We freed up 85 per cent because we believed we were representing the workers in these industries. At least there is someone representing the interests of Australian workers in this place, and it is not the Australian Labor Party. So, just like the union demanded of our government that we do something for Australian steelworkers, we are demanding that the union movement exercise some responsibility on behalf of Australia's auto workers.</DOC>

I take the opportunity of telling this parliament that this is the first serious attempt at a national level, since salinity became a major problem in Australia, to get a coordinated approach, and one by one, I am pleased to say, the states have come to realise the importance of joint action. I can assure the honourable member that there is nothing inconsistent between the signing of that agreement and pursuing the issues that I know are dear to the heart of the Deputy Prime Minister.I might, for the benefit of the member for New England, inform the parliament that on Saturday, after my return from the United States, I rang the Deputy Prime Minister and thanked him for acting as Prime Minister during my absence - and complimented him on the very good job he had done, might I say. We had a lengthy conversation about a number of issues and one of the issues he specifically raised with me was the very thing raised by the member for New England - that was the question of property rights for water. It is a difficult and important issue, and I can tell the House that there is no more persistent advocate on this issue than my friend and colleague the Deputy Prime Minister. What I have said on this matter I stand by, and we intend to deliver justice for the farmers of Australia on the subject. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his interest in this matter. He, of course, has a rich history of experience in employment issues. It is a very important issue for the small businesses in his electorate.The Labor Party has consistently blocked attempts by this government to reform unfair dismissal laws to help Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. If the unfair dismissal laws are removed from their application to Australia's small businesses, it is expected to create up to 50,000 new jobs. In fact, the Labor Party has opposed our legislative changes on five occasions now since 1997. Unfortunately, I have to inform the member for Deakin and the House that nothing seems to have changed in the Labor Party's approach. It is continuing to oppose us on unfair dismissal law changes that are to the benefit of small business. If we needed any evidence of that, we need only look at Western Australia, where the Labor Party in government is in fact extending the application of unfair dismissal laws, making them more punitive for Australia's small businesses.The Leader of the Opposition is now making promises that he cannot deliver. In December last year he pledged on Sky News that he wanted to `build bridges with the business community' - a broken promise - yet so far on unfair dismissal he has let the business community down. I am asked by the member for Deakin for some of the reasons for the alternative view. I tend at this point to feel a little sorry for the Leader of the Opposition.Government members - No! - I do feel a little sorry for the Leader of the Opposition. He has been having a hard time of it lately. He was belted up underneath the stage of the Sydney Town Hall when he tried to take a tough stand on a few issues. He was booed in Brisbane, so that now -  - It is relevant, Mr Speaker, because -  - Mr Speaker, I was asked why the Labor Party is opposing the government's reform of unfair dismissal laws. - When it comes to the Labor Party formulating their policy on unfair dismissal laws and the bill that will go before the Senate in the next few weeks, we ask - and Australia's 1.2 million small businesses are asking - `Why won't the Labor Party support the government on the reform of unfair dismissal laws?' You ask whether that is linked to the fact that the union movement controls the Labor Party and the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is trying to reform the Labor Party but was beaten up under the stage at the Town Hall in Sydney.  - In his own state of Victoria there is a push by the left of the Labor Party to continue to take control of the party against the wishes of the Leader of the Opposition. - Mr Speaker, there is an easy way for the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition to win the support of Australia's small businesses and that is to support the government's changes to the unfair dismissal laws. It is a simple proposal. Australia's small businesses want to be able to employ more people, but they are afraid of the implications of the unfair dismissal laws. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be cheered at meetings instead of booed, he would be wise to take the advice of the government and Australia's small businesses and support the government's changes to the unfair dismissal laws.</DOC>

 - Let me respond to the shadow minister by saying that I at no stage criticised BHP. What I did was to criticise the AMWU for putting the jobs of 50,000 Australian workers at risk. What that question shows is that members opposite do not represent the workers of Australia; they represent no-one but the union bosses. The once proud Australian Labor Party is exposed, in its support for this particular strike, as nothing but the `Australian trade union party'.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his continuing involvement and support for science and innovation, exemplified by his chairmanship of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation. As the honourable member well knows, this government has revolutionised funding and support for science and innovation, principally through the innovation statement of early last year - Backing Australia's Ability - which injected an additional $3 billion into science and innovation. This was followed up with $233 million extra in the last budget in May, taking the government's support for science and innovation to an all-time high of over $5 billion - all of it targeted and structured to develop a skills base, to create a research environment with the best of facilities and to commercialise our research. All of this is in contrast to noodle nation, which was a grab-fest of ideas and loose concepts, none of which were practical, let alone able to be implemented. The government has worked with the science and research community to make sure that the funding hits those issues which are impediments to world-class research and the like. In addition, over the next six months we have undertaken to commence a process for determining national research priorities with the support and encouragement of the research community so that we can again extract better and long lasting benefit from the taxpayer's investment in science and innovation - as researchers themselves would have us do. I was privileged this morning to be involved in the announcement of a technological breakthrough by Australian based researchers which takes us into a breathtaking new era of science - teleportation. For the uninitiated, which included me before today, teleportation is the disembodiment of an object in one location and the reconstruction of it in another location in a split second. This has phenomenal importance in the world of science - honourable member - It is an opposition fantasy. - It is an opposition fantasy that they can somehow be transported onto the government benches in a split second. You have three years to work out a case to convince the Australian public that you are worthy of holding office. Eight months have already gone and there is no possibility of teleportation on the part of the opposition. This breakthrough by a team at the Australian National University, led by Dr Lam, has been assisted by funding from the Australian Research Council, which we are doubling over the next five years by more than $730 million. It is one of the cutting edge areas of research and quantum mechanics that will revolutionise quantum computing, communications and the like. On behalf of the House I congratulate Dr Lam and his team on their amazing work, which establishes Australia as a world leader in this frontier science and enhances Australia's reputation as a centre of world leading research.</DOC>

 - On Sunday, the member for Barton talked about left wing union leaders as `lunatics' and today he is asking their questions. He is asking the lunatics' questions today. The member for Barton might be a third generation Labor lord, but they will never forgive him on the other side for not having been a trade union official. He is almost alone on the front bench in not having been a trade union official, and these sorts of questions are designed to make up for that fundamental problem. This government is fundamentally committed to the rule of law. We are fundamentally committed to ensuring that the law of the land is obeyed. - We believe that the law of the land should apply behind the factory gates just as much as it applies on the street outside. This government will not rest until the law of the land is applied to workplace relations, as it should in all other areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. The World Summit on Sustainable Development will be held in Johannesburg in August and September later this year. Australia has many interests of course in the outcomes of this world summit. We have been a principal driver in putting on the international agenda a strong focus on oceans and oceans management because the management of our oceans and our fisheries is a very important issue for our region. It is fundamental to food security, it is fundamental to economic development and it is fundamental to relieving poverty. At the recent meeting in Indonesia, held in preparation for the world summit, Australia achieved a good balance between development and conservation and a strong focus in the draft plan of action on oceans management which will be presented to leaders in Johannesburg. The Pacific island states strongly welcomed Australia's commitment to improved oceans management, which we are pioneering at home through the Australian oceans policy and the National Oceans Office. We were particularly pleased by the fact that the draft plan of action put firmly on the agenda the sustainability of the world's fisheries and the need to eliminate subsidies, which encourage illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The draft action plan has also taken up the need to take action to better conserve and manage biodiversity on the high seas. The deep oceans contain significant and unique ecosystems and species among the sea mounts, ridges and sea floor vents. They are truly this planet's last frontier, and it is critical that these are not subject to unregulated exploitation before we know how best to conserve and manage these remarkable ecosystems on a sustainable basis. Australia is also working with our APEC colleagues to improve coral reef management, important breeding grounds for fisheries, to exchange information and develop capacity to better manage coral reefs in the Pacific.There is a dramatic contrast, once again, between the government and the opposition in the development of oceans policy, because it is this government, the Howard government, which has put down Australia's first oceans policy; it is this government which has announced that it is going to be working with the states to put into place a national coastal policy. While we are developing policies in a constructive way we see the total lack of policy direction on the part of the opposition. We see the Leader of the Opposition travelling from Labor conference to Labor conference being howled down by the Luddites in that party and unable to make any progress whatever on policy. It is now some 2,297 days since Labor lost the election in 1996. That is 2,297 days without policy, and there is no prospect whatever that we will see any constructive policy from the Labor Party in this crucial area of oceans management.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have addressed this issue before but I will reiterate one or two things, especially the key points. The fact remains that the previous Labor government is closely identified with the Seasprite project. As I have stated earlier, the decision to procure -  - Mr Speaker, I do not think it hurts to know a little of the history of this subject. The decision to procure the helicopters was announced by Labor in its 1995 budget, when Senator Ray was the Minister for Defence. The request for tender documentation was issued in late 1995.  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am addressing the history of this particular process. The request for tender documentation was issued in late 1995, and binding tenders closed in March 1996. The lack of a liquidated damages clause reflects the original contract issued with the request for tender in 1995 by the Labor government. This proposal was permitted by and evaluated in accordance with the request for tender documentation issued by Labor. Addressing the question of the member, I am advised that the Commonwealth entered a contract with Kaman Aerospace International Corporation on 26 June 1997 for the supply of 11 Super Seasprite helicopters to operate from the Anzac class ships. - The Super Seasprite was selected principally because it could meet all the capability needs of the Anzac ship helicopter role. As an intermediate sized helicopter, the Super Seasprite was assessed as being cheaper to operate than the larger, medium sized Seahawk helicopter. The 11 helicopters were not to be supplied for operation from the then proposed offshore patrol combatant, which was ultimately not proceeded with by Australia in 1998. The benefits of possessing two different types of helicopters, particularly as the Super Seasprite helicopters would have improved technology, would outweigh the benefits of operating a single medium sized helicopter type, the Seahawk. I hope the member for Melbourne Ports is paying attention, because this is important. - Mr Speaker, he did ask the question and I did assume he was interested in the response. - In this regard, the Super Seasprite capability is predominantly antiship, which is a significantly different capability from the submarine role of the Seahawk helicopter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I know from my visits to his electorate that he has a keen interest in the industry, in job creation and in retaining the jobs of Australian workers in the industries that are important to the car industry. It is not just the car industry that is being affected by the reckless actions of the union, on which there is absolute silence from those who sit opposite. Whitegoods industries in Australia, such as Electrolux and the roofing companies, have also been harmed by this strike. Union representatives have threatened further strikes, which places in jeopardy the future of the car industry and, as the Minister for Trade said, Australia's reputation overseas and the future of Australian jobs.Those who sit silently opposite while the unions wreak havoc amongst Australian industries should ask the Premier of South Australia how embarrassing it was for him last week to go to the United States to try to encourage Holden to run a third shift on their plant in Adelaide when there is a threat of that plant's first and second shifts being shut down because of union action. What is industry as a whole saying about this? I note with interest that the member for Barton quoted the Australian Industry Group. In its submission on a future car industry plan, the Australian Industry Group said that there must be industrial relations reform in the car industry if it is to have a future. While those opposite sit silently, this government continues to take action to ensure that Australian workers, including those in the car industry, have jobs. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question is no. As to the disposition of the government, it is to secure passage of its legislation. We are always interested in intelligent and constructive suggestions from the Australian Labor Party. We will consider them, and - I say this very seriously - if the opposition spokesman on these matters wishes to talk to Senator Vanstone with some constructive suggestions, she will be very happy to do that. But the opposition should understand that, the last time I checked, the election was not a draw. It does so happen that the government has proposed things and the Leader of the Opposition knows -  - I was asked what I thought was a constructive question. I am giving a deliberately constructive answer, but that of course is not good enough for the member for Jagajaga. It shows how serious the Labor Party is about decent policy in this area. The member for Lilley knows perfectly well that this country has a problem with the disability support pension in that there are too many people on that pension who are not entitled to it. You know that as well as I do. We have tried to do something about that and thus far we are meeting obstruction from you. - If you have some constructive suggestions to make, go along and talk to Senator Vanstone. I am sure she will provide you with a cup of tea and her normal friendly welcome. She will have you for afternoon tea any time. Could I also say that Senator Vanstone is also engaged in what I know she intends to be constructive discussion with the Australian Democrats. If everybody exercises a lot of commonsense, we can have important savings to the budget, good policy and, as should always be the case, intelligent budget measures which secure the support of the parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and recognise that he, like all members on this side of the House, takes a very strong stand on the issue of people-smuggling and people coming illegally to Australia. I know that the people of Blair appreciate the tough stand their local member takes. We have consulted with our neighbours in relation to the border protection act. We consulted with Indonesia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea before the border protection act regulations were announced. They understand our need for strong border protection measures to counter this insidious criminal activity of people-smuggling. It is yet another example of how we are working with our neighbours in the region to address this problem of people-smuggling. In the region we recognise that people smugglers are criminals responsible for very great human misery. To date, people smugglers have sought to dump their human cargo on Christmas and Cocos islands and on Ashmore Reef in order to gain easy access to the generous refugee determination processes that Australia offers to asylum seekers who arrive lawfully. We frustrated that transit route by excising those territories from Australia's migration zone through the border protection act, which passed through this parliament. We have many reports now that people are still looking for ways to gain access to Australia, and obviously one possibility is through the Torres Strait. The government will do everything they possibly can to ensure that that does not happen. We will remain firm in our commitment to oppose the activities of people smugglers, to frustrate their activities and to keep our borders secure. The government's current proposal is the extension of an existing law, and that existing law was supported not only by members on this side but also by the Australian Labor Party. Now that the Labor Party have decided to do a 180-degree turn they are sending a message to the people smugglers, which is that bipartisanship has now broken down and Australia could once more be open for business for people smugglers. The Australian Labor Party are soft on people smugglers and they do not stand up for the strong protection of Australia's borders. During the lead-up to the last election - I have made this point before - the Labor Party claimed that the government and the opposition had but one position on measures to counter people-smuggling, but we found out after the election that the Labor Party decided to change their position. I am reminded of a statement by the Leader of the Opposition on 7 March. He said:The greatest deceit any Party can perpetrate is to tell the Australian public what they know not to be the truth.Before the last election, the Labor Party were privately saying amongst themselves that they would wait until they got into government - they were the words the member for Fremantle used - before deciding how to change the border protection measures that this government had put in place. The truth is that the Labor Party never intended to maintain bipartisanship beyond 10 November last year, and of course that has been borne out by their great deception in changing their position on these issues. The Leader of the Opposition's credibility will suffer grievously in the community. He will be reminded of his words on 7 March, when he told ABC radio: ... your word is your bond, your word is your currency.The Leader of the Opposition's word was that he supported the government on these border protection issues until 10 November, and after 10 November he changed his position. Many Labor Party members sitting over there were elected on a fraud, and the electors will remember that when the next election comes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and his generous remarks in support of my work in this area. It is important that people understand what excision means. I heard an interjection that suggested that it was in some way excising part of Australia. That is exactly what it is not doing. It is excising for the purpose -   -  - It is excising certain areas of Australia from the coverage of the Migration Act for the purposes of lodging certain applications. In relation to that, it is important to know that all provisions of the Migration Act continue to apply to those places for any Australian citizen and for any lawful non-citizen. Anybody who has authority under the Migration Act to be in Australia is not in any way affected by excision because of the very nature of the definition. I am sure that if any detriment were intended, the legislation would not have had the support that it had from the opposition when it passed this place.Let me make it further clear that Australian citizens continue to be able to move about freely in those areas and are entitled to make any application permitted under the act and in accordance with the act. The only people who are adversely affected are those who are people smugglers and their clients. The reality is that because of the nature of the changes that are potentially disallowable as a result of the announcements made by the Leader of the Opposition and supported by minor parties we are now holding out the welcome mat again to those who may be seeking to come to Australia without lawful authority.It is also important to understand why we received advice in relation to this matter in terms of excising further islands and external territories from the Migration Act provisions. Since 1989, there have been 16 incidents of illegal border crossings in the Torres Strait involving 99 third-party nationals. In recent years, we have had more than 150 people land unlawfully by boat in the Torres Strait. The last boat arrived less than 18 months ago. Movement through the Torres Strait does have associated with it considerable risk - very considerable risk. It is important to understand what denying that excision is likely to do. It draws to people's attention the opportunities that exist through seeking to travel through that region. The fact is, if we are not involved in discouraging people to come that way, we are possibly looking at a further boating tragedy.In the past 15 years, there have been 16 significant maritime incidents involving large vessels, many of which had a pilot on board. When I asked for some advice about that from a Torres Strait Islander pilot he had this to say:Apart from being shallow and narrow the Torres Strait experiences dramatic tidal movements, resulting in strong currents through reefs and islands akin to fast flowing rivers.So when I said yesterday that we had advice from senior officials that these areas ought to be excised from the migration zone, it was in the context of information that was made known to us that people might well be seeking now to access that area to make passage to the Pacific.After question time yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition sought to make a point about the nature of the advice that we are receiving, and I think it is very important to put that advice in context. He put his questions not as I think they were put after question time yesterday but in terms of asking people, as he said on radio today, for a guarantee that if you implemented this excision it would have a particular effect. It is quite unreasonable to think that any public servant is going to be able to say, `I guarantee that every person who might potentially want to come that way will be deterred. - But it is very important not to misrepresent the advice that you received. - I want to quote from that advice so that there can be no ambiguity -   - I simply wanted to say that I did ask for a brief from officials who attended that meeting yesterday so that we could deal with it in a factual way. Mr Metcalfe, who is the deputy secretary of my department, having checked with the secretary and other officials who were there, put this to me as his recollection and it was in this form:Generalised information that, notwithstanding the clear success of disruption and deterrence efforts over recent months, some people smugglers remain active and are looking for new routes to transport passengers to Australia or other South Pacific destinations; the excision regulations had been recommended to ministers by the People Smuggling Task Force in response to specific, identifiable information that people smugglers may soon attempt a more easterly route, avoiding the already excised territories of Cocos and Keeling Islands, Christmas Island and the Ashmore Reef; landfall on an island such as the Torres Strait was therefore a possibility; unless islands were excised any arrival there by unauthorised arrivals would mean that they could access protection visa application processes rather than the alternative refugee status determination processes applicable to offshore entry persons; regulations are an important part of our comprehensive disruption and deterrence strategy, in conjunction and in cooperation with UNHCR and IOM and other international agencies and in cooperation with other countries of origin, first asylum and transit in waters adjacent to Australia at both diplomatic and operational levels and including the offshore processing arrangements.That is the context in which these recommendations were made - that it is an important part of a comprehensive approach and that there was information about potential landfall being accessed by people who were seeking a more easterly route. - The brief continued:Mr Crean, inter alia, offered the opinion during the interview that in his view the effect of excision regulations would be merely to encourage people smugglers to target the Australian mainland. Our advice to him was that the potential for people smugglers to target the mainland could never be discounted. There could be no guarantee that any measure, including the proposed excision, would necessarily prevent a boat going through but that should not preclude the extension of the excised islands as an integral part of an overall multilayered strategy, bearing in mind that the strategy and its various tiers had clearly had a great deal of success to date in disrupting and deterring smuggling efforts.I see the Leader the Opposition finds great mirth in these matters. - I will just make it very clear. The point I was making yesterday was that we had advice that these measures were important measures as part of the overall strategy to deal with people-smuggling. I make that point again. We had it on advice and if, for one reason or another, we find that there are boat arrivals in future on excised islands or territories in respect of which we are not able to act to protect Australia's interests, it will be on your heads, not ours.</DOC>

 - I understand my chief of staff was at the meeting and at the briefing. I did not ask her for the report that I received. I asked for the officials who were there to outline what they had heard and what they said. The only substantive difference that has emerged in their recollections and the Leader of the Opposition's is that yesterday no reference was made to an assurance or a guarantee. The officials believed they were asked to give a guarantee. The Leader of the Opposition seems to be suggesting that he asked for an assurance. I simply make the point again that it is quite unreasonable to ask, in relation to all of the vagaries that exist in relation to these matters, whether somebody can guarantee that a particular event will occur or will not occur. That in no way detracts from the argument or the advice that people give that a measure like this will have an important impact on dealing with the broad range of people-smuggling issues that we are confronting. I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would be persisting in trying to push this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and I acknowledge the fact that he is the best member for Dobell that we have seen in this parliament for a very long period of time. There is no area of Commonwealth expenditure growing faster than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which increased by 14 per cent last year and 14 per cent this year. In fact, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has quadrupled in cost over the last decade. This is a scheme by which the taxpayer essentially subsidises pharmaceutical benefits, and a contribution is sought from pensioners of $3.60. The budget announced that it would increase by $1 to $4.60. The person that is not entitled to the concessional scheme pays a maximum of $22.40. The budget proposes to lift that to $28.60. But regardless of the cost of the prescription -  whether it is $100, $200, $500 or $1,000 -  the maximum amount, under the govern-ment's proposal, that a pensioner can be asked to pay is $4.60. And after 52 scripts in a year, additional scripts are free to the pensioner.  That copayment - the idea of a copayment - has been in place since 1990. In 1990, the copayment was introduced by the then Labor minister, Mr Brian Howe. He introduced it to ensure that, as there was a patient contribution, this scheme would be financially sustainable. Not only did Brian Howe introduce the copayment for pensioners of $2.50 in 1990; he increased the general contribution in that year by 36 per cent. He increased it by 36 per cent in the 1990 budget. That was the first budget after the 1990 election. That budget went into the Senate and the then opposition passed those measures because it believed it was responsible to put the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis. After those measures had been put in place, the copayment contribution recovered 21.6 per cent of the cost of running the scheme. In this current year, the amount which is recovered from the scheme has fallen to 15.7 per cent. The passing of the government's measures will return it to 19 per cent - less than it was under the Australian Labor Party in 1990. In other words, in 1990 the taxpayer put in less than $4 for the $1 copayment contribution. After our measures, the taxpayer will put in more than the $4. But, if we do not reform the scheme, the amount recovered out of the copayment - which is 15.7 per cent this year - will continue to fall. We would say to the Australian Labor Party - and there are some members of the Australian Labor Party who do not remember the events of 1990 - that the Australian Labor Party was not always led by opportunists. We did not agree with everything that Brian Howe said. Brian Howe was a member of the Left. But, as a health minister in a Labor government, he believed that it was important to make this scheme sustainable for the people of Australia who rely upon it. And there was an opposition that supported him.Now you have a cheapjack political opportunist as the Leader of the Labor Party. Some people in the Labor Party think it has always been cheap and opportunist. It was not the case. Brian Howe was somebody who was determined to ensure that this scheme became sustainable. I say to the Australian Labor Party backbench, those people who would like to see some measure of principle return to your leadership: it is the people that care enough to make this scheme sustainable that are going to ensure good health care for all Australians. The people that are selling essentially the lie that the taxpayer can continue to increase its subsidy year after year are the people that will lead to an unsustainable scheme which eventually is going to affect the poor and those Australians who deserve good health care.That is why this government is determined to reform the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme along the lines which the Labor Party started, which Brian Howe pioneered. I pay credit to Brian Howe for pioneering that in 1990. Oh, I wish we had a few more Brian Howes left on the Labor Party front bench. The member for Jagajaga learned her politics at the knee of Brian Howe, but she cannot follow his principles. Where is the leader on the Labor Party front bench that will stand and say, `In the great tradition of Brian Howe I want to ensure that pharmaceutical benefits are there for all Australians'? Where is the principle in the Labor Party? Who in the Labor Party will stand against cheapjack opportunism and defend a principle these days?I say again that if the Australian Senate wants to make this scheme unsustainable then the only corollary of that is that fewer new treatments will come onto the scheme. That is the corollary of it. If the copayment contribution continues to decline, governments will be forced to take a much tougher attitude on the listings of new pharmaceutical benefits. That will be the consequence for the Australian Labor Party. That is where its opportunism will lie. The people of Australia need to know that this is not a policy to look after pensioners and those that need decent, affordable pharmaceuticals; this is opportunism which will lead to hardship for people in Australia, who deserve much better from the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very great interest in rail. He is really a very passionate supporter of revitalisation of the rail industry in Australia, and for a very good reason: a rapidly growing economy is producing increases in freight volumes which are way beyond what transport planners in Australia have allowed for in recent times. We are determined to ensure that a decent chunk of this increased freight goes onto rail. If it all goes onto our roads, on current indications we will have double the number of trucks congesting our highways by the year 2020.Our rail reform initiatives have focused on introducing competition and private sector expertise into above rail operations. As I have said in this place before, they have certainly produced some spectacular results on the east-west corridor, where rail's market share of the east-west land transport market has grown from 65 per cent to around 80 per cent over the last three or four years. Volumes in the opposite direction, from west to east, have shown an even more rapid growth of a quite astonishing 11 per cent average per annum. We now have some figures available which indicate that in this financial year, 2001-02, Australian Railtrack Corporation volumes are up almost 10 per cent on last year's, which is a really sound performance and reflective of the value of some pretty worthwhile, though hard won, reforms.The next major obstacle in terms of rail reform is what is known as the north-south corridor - broadly speaking, the one that runs from Melbourne to Brisbane, points between and beyond. The key to this area of rail reform is unquestionably New South Wales. Some 15 per cent only of the land freight on the north-south corridor is on rail; the rest is on our roads, and rail continues to lose market share. This will lead to very serious congestion problems and unbearable pressures on road budgets if it is not dealt with. So the key is very much New South Wales. If we can secure decent reforms there on the main line track - and we are in negotiations to do that at the moment - very substantial resources of the order that the member for Hinkler has referred to as being necessary, as has the reportage that he and his committee have engaged in in the past, will be released from a combination of sources: Commonwealth government funding; the ARTC, which has a very strong balance sheet of its own; and also, as we now know, the private sector, displaying a strong willingness to invest in rail provided that they know that there will be a return on their investment. This is a far cry from the way in which rail was dying under Labor, with their obstinate refusal to reform work practices and to make worthwhile investments. The ALP showed no interest in rail and they continue to show no interest in rail; yet this is a major plank of transport reform if the sector is to be an effective enabler for the rest of the economy into coming decades.</DOC>

 - In relation to Pol Pot, I can certainly recall making such remarks. In relation to the processes being undertaken by the government, they were discussed in the parliament yesterday. The Prime Minister and I have answered such questions on a number of occasions in the parliament and the media. - The point I have always made is this: this is a government that is determined to have a consultative process before it enters into treaty ratifications. -  - The Labor Party laughs but it arrogantly entered into a security treaty with Indonesia. It did not even consult the cabinet. Even the foreign minister was told by the Prime Minister on the day the announcement was to be made that the treaty was to be signed. The then foreign minister rang me on that day to say, `I have just heard this.' We have a consultative process, not the arrogant disregard for opinions of members of parliament and the cabinet. It is as simple as that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his concern to ensure freedom and fair play for the workers and taxpayers of Victoria. - I regret to tell the House that there are serious problems in the construction industry, mostly because the CFMEU is a kind of living museum of Marxist archaeology, split into Beijing line and Moscow line factions who still have not worked out that it is 13 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the complete discrediting of Marxist ideology. I can tell the House that the construction industry, nationally, accounts for about 60 per cent of complaints of breach of the freedom of association principles. Last year, the construction industry accounted for 31 per cent of all working days lost through strikes. The Victorian construction industry is just about the epicentre of industrial militancy in Australia. Construction costs in Melbourne are estimated to be 30 per cent higher than construction costs in Sydney. Tenderers in Sydney allow one strike day every two months, but tenderers in Melbourne have to allow for one strike day every two weeks. No less an authority than the national secretary of the construction division of the CFMEU - a comparatively responsible official, John Sutton - has said that criminal elements are infiltrating his industry, elements associated with the union leadership in Melbourne and Perth.  Strikes cost jobs. Strikes hurt taxpayers and consumers. Victorian government construction projects are regularly way out of time and way over budget thanks to industrial militancy, and the daddy of them all is the Federation Square project, where costs have blown out from $110 million to $450 million, largely thanks to industrial militancy - and the project still is not finished. Premier Bracks wants the MCG redevelopment to be an action replay of Federation Square, and he risks making the people's ground a CFMEU playground. Just about the only responsible union official associated with the construction industry in Victoria is Bill Shorten, and he has just been rolled by the National President of the ALP, Greg Sword. Bill Shorten is about the only official who supports the 50-50 rule, and Simon Crean has just ratted on him. I notice that the member for Maribyrnong has -  - The Manager of Opposition Business is obviously rattled by his and his party's links with ultramilitant union officials, and we have the member for Maribyrnong joining the lemming-like rush away from Bill Shorten to join the Socialist Left and rat on the Leader of the Opposition -  - Along with the workers and taxpayers of Victoria, the other day I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition hitched a ride in Steve Johnson's souped-up Ford to take a burn around the streets of Canberra. That is the trouble: he is always a passenger in someone else's -  -  - I have been asked about militant union activity, and the Leader of the Opposition is usually a passenger in a union jalopy driven by Dougie Cameron or Craig Johnson. - Mr Speaker, it is perfectly in order for me to talk about - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. The honourable member is very interested in our export figures and our export effort, given that one of the largest export earners in her electorate is the tourism industry. I can inform the House that the tourism industry in Australia, the largest individual export earner, would be much happier and much more comfortable if the Labor Party passed the government's unfair dismissal legislation in the Senate to secure the jobs of all those small business people involved in the tourism sector. That is a component of the $154 billion that exports earn for the Australian economy - or they did last year, and we aim to see that increase. That sustains one in five jobs across Australia. It actually sustains one in four jobs in electorates such as yours, Mr Speaker, in rural and regional Australia, where exports are vitally important in generating jobs growth. That is what our government is absolutely focused on in terms of our trade policy.Our trade policy is not just a single track. It is not just barrelling down one path, as the Labor Party and the union movement in Australia would want; we are focused on the multilateral, the regional and the bilateral. The previous Labor opposition at least had some sense in terms of what their trade policy was. The former trade spokesperson - I think it was Senator Cook - at least agreed with the government's pursuit of a free trade agreement with America. To start with, the member for Cunningham did and then he did not. Then the Leader of the Opposition stepped in and they did not. So it has been a little difficult to follow the manoeuvring of the Labor Party. Maybe it was the member for Rankin who intervened, but I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who actually had more positions on this particular issue than you see in a game of Twister. Interestingly, the Leader of the Opposition in his intervention on this issue said in a press release:In a speech delivered today on my behalf by Shadow Primary Industries Minister -  - The House needs to understand some simple facts about the Labor Party's opposition to our government's pursuit of a free trade agreement with America and the fact that they are hinging that on -  - I will come to that in a minute. Your comment was:In a speech delivered today on my behalf by Shadow Primary Industry minister Kerry O'Brien, I told the National Farmers' Federation annual conference the Free Trade Agreement should be off the table as long as the Farm Bill is on the statute books.That is the press release from the Leader of the Opposition. That is Labor's position. The farmers of Australia, this House and all Australians should know what this means. The agreement that the Labor Party in government signed in 1994 created a legal circumstance for the United States to apply that amount on their farm bill. It was signed off by none other than the member for Fraser, the shadow Treasurer. He sold out Australian farmers. The Labor Party in government agreed in those negotiations to legalise under the WTO -   - The member for Fraser still does not know what he has done; he is shaking his head. In 1994, the Labor Party in government agreed under the WTO negotiations at the Uruguay Round that the United States could legally apply $23 billion worth of domestic support. - For the information of the member for Werriwa, the legal circumstance that exists in the WTO now is what you, the member for Fraser and your government signed off on in 1994. I started to highlight what they negotiated - and it still exists today - that created the circumstance for the current US Administration to implement the current farm bill. They agreed to $23 billion worth of support for the United States, $40 billion worth of support - and these are US dollars - for Japan, and $76 worth of support for the European Union. But what did they negotiate for Australian farmers? - It was $US76 billion. Come on Mark, muscle up! All they negotiated for Australian farmers was $US300 million. That stands today. We are seeking in the Doha Round of negotiations to reduce those levels of support that the Australian Labor Party signed off on and agreed to. Labor sold out Australian farmers when they were in government. We stand here pursuing an aggressive and ambitious trade agenda in pursuit of more jobs for Australians and to make it much fairer for all Australians as far as our trade and our export effort are concerned. All Australians should know that what we are confronting in the US farm bill today was agreed to and legitimised by the Australian Labor Party in government in 1994.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. The outcome of those discussions is that an options paper regarding the issue will be before ministers very shortly. I am concerned about some of the cases that have been brought to my attention in relation to that. I will not allow deserving causes to be hurt. Within the bounds of what is our responsibility as distinct from the responsibility of the states, I intend to see that there are no injustices done to important services in this very critical area of need, where many of the workers are not highly paid.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Today is a very special day because tonight in the Great Hall the Prime Minister and I will be hosting a dinner for Work for the Dole recipients around this country, including people who are supervisors, community work coordinators and participants. They will come here to celebrate the work that they have undertaken and the work that they have achieved in their electorates. I welcome a number of them who are in the gallery today, from right across Australia, and acknowledge the fine work they have been undertaking. In the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate alone there have been over 120 projects and some 880 placements since the inception of Work for the Dole. The participants have been doing very valuable community work in the areas of heritage, the environment and community building. All of these people are gaining a worthwhile experience for themselves and doing something positive for their community. We as a government and as a parliament should be proud of their achievements.To give you some examples: in the electorate of Barker in South Australia, we have restoration and conservation of the old Mount Gambier jail building and surrounding grounds as a national heritage listed site, owned by the City of Mount Gambier. In Eden-Monaro, we have landscaping and revegetation projects with the Eurobodalla Shire. I visited a gentleman in Solomon in the Northern Territory the other day who is part of the Work for the Dole program and he described it as his dream job. He said he was involved with the aviation museum, assisting staff in the museum - for example, assisting tour guides, assisting with security, helping with exhibits and directing museum participants. In the electorate of Fadden, we have the restoration of a 40-foot Huon pine Army launch. This was used during World War II to rescue injured soldiers in Papua New Guinea and transport them to waiting hospital ships. These are just some of the projects that are going to the very core of what we are as a nation: working together in partnership to help people to feel a part of the community and to do something worth while.Work for the Dole is going one step further because we are now involved in projects of national significance. In WA and Victoria we are now listing and recording, for the benefit of generations to come, the arrival of Australian families to Fremantle and to Victoria so that people can look that information up on the Internet to see what their heritage is and where we have come from. Just as the 2001 census recorded data, this project will put all of that data that has been collected over the years into a useable form. It is another practical example of the fine work that Work for the Dole is undertaking in the heritage, community and environment areas of Australia. I am pleased to say that there are at least three members of the opposition who have chosen to come along tonight and I thank them for showing support to their communities, as many on this side will be doing. The members for Kingston and Bass will be coming along and I just hope tonight that they will see the energy and commitment that these people have. In doing so, I hope that maybe there will be a transformation on that side to embrace what Work for the Dole is doing for Australia in such a positive form.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question, which gives me the opportunity to make some remarks to the House and to Australians about Australian higher education. -  - At the end of the first month of having had the privilege to be Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training, I made a number of decisions in relation to Australian universities following consultation with my colleagues. Firstly, there is not a crisis in Australian higher education despite the comments of some. Secondly, the status quo for Australian higher education, if it is to serve the best interests for the next generation of Australians, is something that we should not be prepared to accept. In response to that, we established a special unit within my department to oversee a reform process. We brought the Business Council of Australia into that and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. The first of a series of discussion papers has been released by my department, to which the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee responded yesterday. Along with a number of constructive organisations and individuals, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has made a number of recommendations under what it describes as 20/20 vision. In describing their response to the government's discussion paper on higher education reform as 20/20 vision, the vice-chancellors have thought about where Australian universities are going to be in 20 years from now and how they will be serving the best interests of the economic and social development of the country.  - Honourable members just need to understand the importance and significance of this: the vice-chancellors of Australia's 38 universities unanimously endorsed a position which they have put to me as the minister proposing a number of fundamental reforms to put Australian universities on a sound footing for the 21st century. One of the recommendations that they have argued - now these are the people who run, live, breathe and know Australian universities - to the government is that it should consider some limited deregulation of Australian fees. So that submission, along with other constructive submissions, will be considered seriously by the government; it will be considered by me.The other point that should be made in relation to this is this: I said to the opposition when we started this process that it had a choice. The choice was that it could take one of two roads. One road would be to criticise me, to criticise the government, every day in relation to trying to think about policy framework reform in Australian universities. The opposition could issue a press release a day criticising me or the government and on a good day - from the opposition's point of view of opposing everything - issue two releases. Yesterday they issued two releases - not one, but two. The first was from Senator Kim Carr. You might be interested to know he actually said that universities that did not do much research would `languish more or less as teaching-only institutions and community colleges'. In other words, the Labor Party thinks that out of this reform process an increased emphasis on teaching is not to be supported. - The second fiddle, so to speak, came in when we received the second media release - this one from the member for Jagajaga - late yesterday. In the last paragraph - the press release is about the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and universities - it says:A second report - this is the second report to follow the first discussion paper, which I released in April - A second report Strings for Quality had been scheduled for today - That is what the member for Jagajaga said. Someone has been stringing her along, because when I release the second discussion paper in the next few days it will be delivered to the member for Jagajaga, wrapped in brown paper and tied up with strings. A bloke in Launceston on Friday, when I was opening the Tasmanian Academy for Performing Arts at the university, said to me, `Mate, what's this 50-50 rule all about?' And I said, `It's a sandwich board, mate. On one side they tell you what they want you to hear and on the other side they actually say what they mean.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I recall that I spent a very interesting couple of days with her in her electorate last week, where there is no doubt that she is extremely effective in representing the concerns of her constituents and in promoting some very valuable government programs. - Those include a very innovative cadetship for young people. I was able to spend some time with the pilot group that has now been involved in that cadetship for several months. The program has been extended. Under that program, young people wanting to learn a range of life skills, to interact with the community, to learn how to volunteer or to learn skills that are useful for volunteering are benefiting significantly. I know the member has a very deep commitment to it and it was quite touching to see the way in which those people responded to her concern. While we were there, we also saw how the community is pulling together through programs like Work for the Dole interactions between various groups with perhaps what might be described as `disadvantaged' or `awkward' positions. Indeed, what was interesting was hearing from the participants in that Work for the Dole program in Nowra how much they valued it. It is not so long ago that those opposite thought that this was a dreadful program. They went right out on a limb to say that it was against the interests of Australian workers, against the interests of participants, that the prospects of coercion were draconian, unwise and unnecessary, but they have backed off now because those who are benefiting from the program find it very valuable.In addition to that, I was able to announce that the government is putting together a funding package for Sealab, which will give people in that part of the coastal region of New South Wales the capacity to fully research the marine environment so that they are able to conserve it better in the future, and also exploit the natural resource wisely and in balance in a way that will see local investment and jobs benefit. There is quite a range of programs being used. I attended a dinner with the Area Consultative Committee, which was able to outline all the ways they have been interacting in partnership with the Commonwealth government to build investment in Nowra and in surrounding shires. The population of Nowra is increasing by some 2,000 a year. They had over 300 people at that dinner. I believe my colleague the Minister for Employment, Science and Training attended the same dinner last year. It is the very model of partnership between the Commonwealth, a local member and the electorate, producing benefits for all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question and note that she is a very strong advocate for the small businesses in her electorate, including Peards nursery, which we visited in Albury and which is a great story about a small business that has become a very successful larger business. Around two-thirds of Australia's 1.2 million small businesses operate from home, and home based businesses have increased by around 16 per cent per year in the last two years, so it is now the fastest-growing type of business in Australia. There are several factors contributing to this. The most obvious factor is the growth of new technology. Most home based businesses now own a computer, and almost half of those home based businesses are using the Internet for commerce. It means that small businesses are accessing new markets from home rather than setting up shopfronts or industrial premises.What is surprising is that, of the 780,000 home based small businesses across Australia, almost a third employ staff from home. For these businesses, employing a person from home is a certain risk; it is different to employing someone in an office or in a factory. There are certain risks associated with employing people within your own home. That is why it is so important to change the unfair dismissal laws to give Australia's home based small businesses a better than even chance of addressing a problem in employment within the four walls of their own home. The government is determined to help those small businesses. They represent the fastest area of growth in small businesses in Australia.  We want to remove the risks of employing people at home, and the best way to do that is to remove the application of the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws from small businesses. The Labor Party are determined to oppose us in this regard. They do not care about home based small businesses. They do not care about creating jobs. The Labor Party are only interested in helping their mates in the unions. If they really want to support small business and if they really want to support job creation, they should support our position on abolishing unfair dismissal laws as they apply to home based businesses.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm at least one thing, and that is that the member for Griffith can read the newspapers, because those reports all appeared there. Let me say this: we did have a very vigorous debate yesterday, and I am proud of that. I will tell you why I am proud of it: I can still remember a car telephone call - not the one that some people immediately think of -   - It was in Melbourne. It was in December of 1995. I was rung by the then foreign minister, Gareth Evans. In those breathless, earnest and grave tones for which he was famous, the then foreign minister said to me, `Mate, I've got great news. We have negotiated an agreement with Indonesia and nobody knows about it.' He said, `I want you to keep this very confidential.' - No. - They have all had their fun, Mr Speaker. When it comes to entering into international obligations, the difference between us and those who sit opposite is that we involve the Australian people and they never did. Let me say that this government will never enter into international obligations without fully involving the Australian people in that process. Let me also make this very clear: we are not going to enter into any international obligations that compromise the sovereignty of this country. That is a fundamental given of any approach that we have to these matters.I listened very carefully to what was a very well-informed and vigorous debate. I depart from my normal practice in relation to all but one of the allegations about it that were made. Let me make it very plain that everybody who participated in that debate participated out of great goodwill, not only to the national interest but also to the interests of people of other countries. Any suggestion that any prejudice or intolerance was displayed during that debate is absolutely wrong. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that this government will take its decisions in accordance with the processes of the government parties. That involves consideration by the party room and then consideration by the cabinet. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and I can assure the Australian people that the decision that will come from the cabinet as a result of that consideration will be one that will serve the national interest and certainly not compromise Australian sovereignty.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I do appreciate the serious and considered approach he takes to foreign policy issues in general and the situation in the Middle East in particular. The government condemns the suicide bombing in Israel yesterday that killed at least 19 Israelis. I am told there are now some 21 Israelis who remain in hospital. I offer Australia's condolences to the victims of this latest act of terror. With depressing regularity, such acts take place when fresh peace initiatives just start to get under way. That of course is profoundly depressing.The government has made this point on several occasions before, but the Palestinian Authority must take stronger action against terrorism. Chairman Arafat and other members of the Palestinian Authority must act decisively to stop these acts of terrorism. I also take the opportunity to urge Israel's regional neighbours to bring pressure to bear to ensure an end to these appalling acts of murder - these attacks on innocent civilians, including, in this case, children - and to do what they can to encourage a resumption of negotiations. During the course of last two days I have been with Iran's Foreign Minister, Dr Kharrazi, and I have taken advantage of my meetings with him to make these points. I have spoken in similar terms to representatives of Israel's Arab neighbours.We support the United States leadership in its efforts to secure an end to violence, to address the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people and to advance a political process. We have welcomed - and I welcome again - the Saudi-initiated Arab peace proposal. We, as Australians, stand ready to consider practical ways in which we can support those more centrally involved in efforts to secure peace. Despite these latest and very brutal attacks, we must hold to the vision - which was affirmed by the United Nation's Security Council in March - of a region where two states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side within secure and recognised borders. But an eventual peace depends ultimately on the efforts of the Palestinians and the Israelis. It has to be their peace; they have to own it.The government remains concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories. Australia has committed $1 million in humanitarian assistance to help relieve the suffering of those affected by the recent violence. Total Australian aid flows to the Palestinian territories and Palestinian refugees in surrounding countries is estimated to be about $10½ million this financial year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question and the opportunity to elaborate briefly on these matters. Can I first say that I think on Tuesday I mentioned that there was an important memorandum of understanding signed between Australia and Indonesia and that that was done in Indonesia. In fact, the memorandum was signed in Perth.The government, of course, takes these matters very seriously. There is information of a credible threat to Australia's northern borders as people smugglers move their trade in an easterly direction. The decision to excise Christmas Island, Ashmore and Cartier islands, and the Cocos islands, of course, has, along with a range of other initiatives which I enumerated earlier, been successful in deterring boats from seeking to access Australia.The government does believe that the additional excisions that we have proposed and implemented by way of regulation will provide an additional deterrent and are an important part of the broader strategy of prevention, interdiction and deterrence. It is regrettable, of course, that the Labor Party have once again shown that they are unwilling to embark on fully implementing all of those measures, which we are advised will enable us to best protect our borders. Yesterday, the ALP in the Senate complained that they did not have a chance to debate the proposed regulations and wanted us to bring forward the tabling of those matters so that there could be, presumably, an earlier attempt to disallow them and to ensure that they are in place for as little time as possible in order to provide the protection that is important. That is the reason they want to do it. - It is not a question of debate -  - it is a question of bringing it forward so you can cut it off as quickly as possible. - That is clearly what the Labor Party have in mind. They are hanging their colours out there so that everybody knows they are not serious about border protection. But we intend to give the opposition an opportunity to make it clear that they are sabotaging the border protection measures. We will table the regulations in the Senate this afternoon, giving the opposition leader an opportunity to reconsider his position, and we will see whether he is prepared to support these sensible, logically developed and important regulations. But I suspect from the nature of that response that he will remain captive of those who are seeking to get the Labor Party to go soft on border protection. - I want to give the Leader of the Opposition notice that the government will be introducing legislation into this House tomorrow to provide protection by way of amendment to the Migration Act, and you will have an opportunity to deal with that legislation as well as all of the implications over the longer term that that will involve. I think it is also very important to know that, in relation to these matters, the government is well supported by those who have a view about the islands to our north. I particularly want to table for the benefit of members a press release from the Torres Strait Regional Authority in which that authority welcome news that we would extend the definition of excised offshore places to include the islands of the Torres Strait. Mr Terry Waia said:The change to the act will not affect current traditional activities but will give greater protection against illegal immigrants infiltrating the Australian borders through the Torres Strait. The inclusion of the Torres Strait in the amended act as an excised offshore place removes the ability of unauthorised arrivals into the Torres Strait from being able to access an Australian visa - The authority recount their recent experience with a growing number of illegal migrants using the Torres Strait as an entry point and it is good to see that the government is taking positive action to address this problem.</DOC>

 - The honourable member asked a question about a serious subject. It was almost identical to the question asked yesterday by the member for Calare. I refer the member for Sydney to the answer that I gave to the member for Calare yesterday. But, as people in the gallery who have a very legitimate interest in this issue were not present yesterday, let me repeat what I said to the member for Calare yesterday. I have had drawn to my attention the concerns of a number of groups in relation to this quite difficult issue. I have asked for the preparation of a paper listing a series of options for the government to consider relating to ensuring that the Commonwealth's responsibilities in this area are met. I want to give an assurance that I do not intend to see important services for the disabled and the disadvantaged in New South Wales or indeed elsewhere in the Commonwealth affected. It will take a while to work through the response, but I want to assure those representatives that we are concerned. We do recognise that many of the people employed in this sector are paid quite low wages and that a proper and sympathetic response from governments at both levels is needed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can tell him that in order to underpin necessary social services it is necessary to have the financial arrangements which will sustain them. There could be no other area of policy where that is more required than in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. - When the Labor Party introduced the copayment for pensioners, which was in 1990 - and I think the member for McMillan was alive then, Mr Speaker -  -  - we were in opposition and we supported Brian Howe when he introduced a $2.50 copayment. It was done in order to put the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis. After it was introduced, the amount of the scheme which was recovered through copayment was 21.6 per cent, and that is why Brian Howe and then Treasurer Paul Keating introduced it. - Today the copayment is 15.7 per cent of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If the government's measures go through, it would return to 19 per cent; that is, less than it was when Brian Howe introduced the copayment but not at the 15.7 per cent of cost recovery that it now is. Some in the media have been amused that we would quote a member of the Socialist Left, Brian Howe, in support of a proper financial basis for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is not because the coalition government supports the Socialist Left over the divided Labor Unity faction of the Labor Party; it is just to illustrate that even the most irresponsible member of the Socialist Left is more responsible than the current leader of the Labor opposition. That is the proposition. There is no greater political opportunist in Australia today than the member for Hotham, who is opposing these measures which are to base the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme -  - The greatest threat to responsible economic policy in Australia today is the member for Hotham, the Leader of the Opposition, Australia's greatest political opportunist. - My proposition was that Brian Howe was not a threat to economic or budget policy. It is the Leader of the Opposition who is a threat to budget policy - that is the whole proposition. Australia's greatest political opportunist, who was in the parliament in 1990 and, along with the Liberal Party and the National Party voted for the $2.50 copayment, now says that a proposal to return cost recovery, not to what it was then but to 19 per cent less than it was then, is somehow beyond the pale.Brian Howe and the member for Hotham recognised that in 1990. In the budget speech of 1990 the then Labor Treasurer, in support of the $2.50 copayment, said:... scientific advances have resulted in a massive increase in the number and variety of health care drugs available.It took almost 40 years - from 1948 to 1985 - for the costs of that scheme to grow to half a billion dollars.It took only another 4 years for the costs to grow by another half a billion dollars. And in another three years those costs would have reached over $2 billion were we not to have acted now.That is what he said in 1990. Today the scheme runs at above $4 billion. In 1990, when the copayment was first introduced and the non-concessional card increase was 36 per cent, the Labor Treasurer, Mr P.J. Keating, said:The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy.That is what the Labor Party said: reconstruct the scheme with a copayment and a non-concessional copayment recovering 21 per cent of the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy. That is what Mr Keating said in 1990, that is what the member for Hotham voted for in 1990 and that is what Brian Howe said in 1990.Today we have Australia's greatest political opportunist opposing the measures to reconstruct the scheme, not because he cares about the sick or those who need medicines; he cares only about his failing leadership, which needs a stand to try to prop it up. That is what this is all about. Nothing could illustrate more to the Australian public that this is an opposition that no longer hold any prospect of being in government. If the opposition genuinely thought they would one day be in government, knowing that this scheme has to be properly financially based, they would be voting for this just as the Liberal Party voted for it in 1990 knowing that we would one day be in government and intending to take advantage of it to base a proper Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.This is an opposition who are now consumed by oppositionism for the sake of it. They have no principle. There were people on this side who thought the opposition could not become more opportunistic after the demise of the member for Brand - we thought it would not be possible - and yet Australia's greatest political opportunist, a man who voted for a copayment in 1990 and for an increase, stands there now with no concern for medicine.</DOC>

 - No. Of course -  -  - I am sorry to interrupt his interjections, Mr Speaker, but I can say, in relation to the government's proposals, which take the cost recovery back to 19 per cent - lower than it was when the Labor Party introduced it at 21 per cent - that we also have a proposal which says that, after 52 scripts in a year, they are free. - In addition to this, this government - the first government in Australian history to do so - has by law indexed the pension to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, which will increase the pension by $10 per fortnight this year. - It had never previously been legislated -  - for the pension to be indexed to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. - And because of that - and because earnings are increasing faster than inflation - the pension is moving faster than costs, including costs which are built into the consumer price index, and will increase by $10 a fortnight over the course of the next two periods of indexation. So, although there is the $1 contribution, which can amount to a maximum of $52 per annum - thereafter, prescriptions are free - over that period the pension will increase by $10 per fortnight. I come back to this simple proposition -  - We know that the Labor Party are not opposed to a copayment, because the Labor Party introduced it. - We know that the Labor Party are not opposed to increasing the co-contribution -  - because they increased it by 36 per cent for non-pensioners in 1990 - without any compensation, so I do not know why he interjects about compensation. We know that the Labor Party agree that 21 per cent is a fair cost recovery on the scheme, so what possible opposition could they have to a 19 per cent recovery? As Treasurer Keating said:The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether ...Do you know why he said that in 1990? Let me remind you. He was worried that in three years the cost would reach $2 billion per annum. What is it today? It is $4.2 billion per annum; and the Labor Party are trying to knock the co-contribution down to 15.9 per cent. This is an opposition which is now more irresponsible than any previous opposition in Australian history, one which lacks leadership, lacks principle and lacks policy. At the end of the day, it is the people who rely on this scheme who will suffer because of Labor Party opportunism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I think her constituents are very grateful to her for the support she gives to the government on the issue of border protection. She is certainly strong on border protection. Yesterday I had a very constructive discussion with Michel Gabaudan, the regional representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He briefed me in particular on the high rate of return of Afghanis to Afghanistan. Indeed, interestingly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expects around two million people to return to Afghanistan to live by the end of this year. This obviously puts some strain on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other aid organisations operating in Afghanistan, and I gave an undertaking to Mr Gabaudan to ensure that our aid commitments were delivered as quickly as possible - indeed, we are accelerating some of the payment of those aid commitments.I also had a useful discussion yesterday with the Iranian foreign minister about the situation in Afghanistan at the political level, particularly with the Loya Jirga having concluded now and with the election of the former interim president as the now temporary president of Afghanistan. There is no doubt that there is a general view that, although the situation is still complex and difficult in Afghanistan, there is a degree of stability entering the country now.Mr Gabaudan and I also spoke about the very close and effective cooperation that there has been between our immigration officials and the UNHCR in Nauru. I was able to brief Mr Gabaudan on my discussions with President Harris last week and to thank him for the very good work that the UNHCR has done in Nauru.I did take the opportunity, not surprisingly, of assuring Mr Gabaudan that this government is going to remain strong on border protection. Regardless of what the opposition says or does, our commitment to border protection is going to remain strong. I did make clear to him that we in Australia do not appreciate ill-informed criticism of Australia's policy from international organisations, such as some of the United Nations agencies. Indeed, I did say to him that such criticism undermines national support for United Nations agencies and that it is not what we pay the United Nations to do. - The member for Griffith interjects. The member for Griffith always has something to say. He reminds me of Sir Robert Menzies' epithet that more people have talked themselves out of this chamber than have ever talked themselves in. That may indeed be the member for Griffith's fate. Yesterday, the member for Griffith talked about the government unleashing a jihad against the United Nations. I would have thought that a rather inappropriate term for a spokesman on foreign affairs to use. This is because apparently the member for Griffith, when it comes to standing up in the parliament, joins in Labor's current bout of criticism against the government's border protection policies. Yet I read in the Financial Review this morning that, during the caucus discussion yesterday on the excision of further islands from the Australian immigration zone, a lot of members, such as the member for Lingiari, supported the Leader of the Opposition but some members expressed concern and, indeed, implied that they opposed the Leader of the Opposition. One of them was the garrulous member for Griffith who was, according to the Financial Review, among some party members who highlighted the concerns in the electorate. In other words, the member for Griffith says one thing in this chamber, he says another thing when he gets into the caucus room - and goodness knows what he says when he gets back to his electorate.This demonstrates how the Labor Party, in the lead-up to the election, tried to communicate a message to the public about being strong on border protection. But, as soon as the election was over, there was a revolt in the Labor Party by what you might call the pseudo-intellectual bourgeois Left - the epitome of which is the member for Fremantle. She is perhaps more bourgeois Left than pseudo-intellectual. These are the people who have cast aside the traditions of Curtin and Chifley. These are the people who have cast aside the Labor Party as the party of working people and who have turned it into the cafe latte party. These are the people who are now getting the upper hand in the debate within the Labor Party on the whole issue of border protection. The fact is simply this: the Labor Party is weak on border protection and this government is strong. </DOC>

 - I think the question was about the pension going below average weekly earnings. That would be the case, because the pension is linked to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, not to average weekly earnings. - If that was supposed to be a cunning little trap in the question, it did not work. This was the government which indexed by law the pension to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. The indexation points are twice yearly, as they were under the Australian Labor Party - twice yearly. If the pension has dipped below 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, it is indexed to the 25 per cent mark or it is indexed to the CPI, whichever happens to be the higher. In a period like the late 1980s when inflation was high and the increase in real wages was negative, as it was under the accord, you would want your pension to be indexed to the CPI because it would be higher. In a period like the late 1990s when wages growth is outstripping the CPI - that is, you have got a real wage increase - you would want it to be indexed to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That is why we have the two markets and that is why, under this government - the first government to actually legislate that - the increases have been greater than they would have been under the CPI.In addition to that, when the government introduced tax reform, we also had a four per cent increase in the pension, a two per cent guarantee rule and indexed. This is the government that legislated the change. Because wages ran higher than CPI, pensioners benefited; they had a real increase in the pension. This is the government that has ensured that people on pensions have been protected against both of those markets.In relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, this is the government which intends to get that onto a financially sustainable basis. If the Labor Party is successful in its sabotage operation - let me make it clear - it will not help the people in this country who rely on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is short-term opportunism and bad policy. It was not the policy of Labor Unity or the Socialist Left in the 1990s, it was not the policy of responsible Labor people and it was not the policy of the member for Hotham in the 1990s when he voted for those changes. This is short-term political opportunism, and it will be exposed for what it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and for his very strong commitment, along with the member for Forde and the member for McPherson, to Griffith University. This government is very much committed to seeing that Australian higher education serves Australia - not only Australian students today but in particular the next and subsequent generations. For that reason, as the minister, I have initiated a review of Australian universities. We have released the first of a series of around six discussion papers to inform the public debate. A specialist unit has been established within my department, and I have had seconded to that unit a person from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and from the Business Council of Australia. I have established a reference group to help guide me through the process, and I have had consultations right throughout the sector with university vice-chancellors, pro-vice-chancellors, academics and unions, including the National Union of Students.The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee released a response to the first discussion paper two days ago. It is rather interesting that in that context the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee was reported in the West Australian yesterday as saying:Each university must have substantial choice in determining its future, so that it meets changing social and economic needs.Further to that, an article in today's Australian under the headline `Full marks to uni chiefs for reform push' says:Already, Australians are labouring under record high levels of income tax, and plundering taxpayers more to fund higher education will simply penalise those who seek to better themselves ...The root of the problem is not a lack of money but the suffocating controls placed on our universities by our model of bureaucratic centralised control.Further on, the article says:At last, politics may be turning in favour of a smarter nation. I am asked about other statements or policies. Within microseconds of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee releasing its considered response to the first ministerial discussion paper, the Labor Party and the member for Jagajaga were out there opposing it and attacking the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee for its considered package of reforms, which it has put to the government for my consideration when looking at the future of Australian higher education. The member for Jagajaga and the Labor Party have attacked any concept of deregulation, of freeing up bureaucracy, in relation to Australian universities. In relation to the university sector, the question which Australians would be asking themselves today - and certainly callers to my office have been asking this - is: does the Labor Party oppose or support deregulation? The reason for that confusion is that the member for `Werra Werra' authored a book -  -  - I like to call him `Werra Werra', but the member for Werriwa, in a book entitled What have you learnt today - imagine who that was targeted at! - said:Governments need to look beyond the mad ideologues and the vested interests in the education debate in this country and develop a fresh policy frontier.He went on to say:Left wing politics refuses to support education other than through government spending, even though the fiscal well has run dry.This is what we mean when we talk about alternative policies, which the Leader of the Opposition spoke to Ray Hadley about earlier in the month. We might be reminded that, when the member for Brand was the Leader of the Opposition, we had these pathetic scenes of him, after six years of leading the Labor Party, standing behind a sign that said, `This is what I stand for.' Now we have the current Leader of the Opposition in a sandwich board, which says on the front what he stands for. He says, `If I am talking to the mad ideologues, I have a particular message and I am opposed to any sort of deregulation. But if, on the other hand, I am talking to people who want to talk about policy, like the member for Werriwa, then I turn around and let them look at the other side of the sandwich board.' The Leader of the Opposition needs to take off his sandwich board and let Australians see what sort of policy ticker actually lies within it. As Ross Gittins said in today's Sydney Morning Herald - and this is prescient advice for the Leader of the Opposition:So Labor ...  will need to have summoned up a lot more courage before the next election because the question of 'where the money's coming from' is the greatest stumbling block standing between us and our future as a knowledge economy.We as Australians face very serious policy choices in relation to Australian higher education. One of those issues is funding, but it is also about governance, administration, specialisation within the sector, strengthening regional universities, and broadening opportunities for Australians from Aboriginal, low-income and rural and regional backgrounds to give them a place and a ticket for a start in the 21st century of education and knowledge.</DOC>

 - Obviously I did not say that to the House yesterday. Hansard, of course, will totally record what I said yesterday. -  - What I said yesterday in the House is in Hansard, and I stand by it absolutely. Back in 1990 when the Labor Party was worried that the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme might go to $2 billion a year, it said - and I totally agree with it:The alternatives are stark - this is the government's position - reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy.If we do not get this scheme onto a proper sustainable base, access to the scheme and the kinds of treatments that Australians want will be available only for the wealthy. That was said in 1990 when Labor was worried the cost might go to $2 billion per annum. Today it is at $4.2 billion per annum. The Labor Party ought to try to come to grips with this one proposition: if it was responsible in 1990 for copayments to recover 21 per cent of the cost, why is it not responsible today for copayments to recover 19 per cent of the cost? Why? Bearing in mind that it was responsible for 21 per cent in 1990, what level does the Australian Labor Party say it is responsible for today?If you do not have this on a sustainable basis, fewer new treatments will be financially affordable in the future. This was the point that was made by Paul Keating and Brian Howe. This was voted for by the member for Hotham. There are a lot of Labor Party backbenchers who cannot remember a time when Labor thought like an alternative government. There was a time - it was not always this unconscionably opportunist. It used to think about how to manage the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. After the term of the member for Hotham's leadership it may go back to that, because the irresponsible opportunism did not work on the GST. Remember back to then: remember when he came in day after day on the GST and remember where it ended. He is coming in day after day on these matters, and let me make a prediction: it will not end in any better outcome for the Labor Party. We can remember the great hilarity of the Labor Party on GST. They said that lettuces would go up and Hockey Bear pyjamas would go up, and Labor would cruise their way into office. It is no different today: they say the PBS will go up, or something else will go up, and they think they will cruise into office. But opportunism did not work for the last six years and it will not work for the next three. The people of Australia deserve much better than that; they deserve a political party that are thinking about how to balance a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which will help the poor and ensure they have access to pharmaceuticals for their needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in relation to the Australian economy. He may be aware that today Westpac released its consumer sentiment for the month of June, showing that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose 2.5 per cent to 112.9. These sentiments rise and fall and one has to bear in mind that there is a lot of variability in them - I have always made that point. But the interesting thing about this was that this sentiment rose. In commenting upon the sentiment, Westpac said:It appears that genuinely positive news on the Australian dollar, employment and economic growth has buoyed the consumer. The Australian dollar had risen, peaking above .57 cents since the previous survey, the unemployment rate was confirmed at 6.3 per cent and the statistician announced 75,000 new full-time jobs had been created in May. It was recently announced that growth for the last year was a very strong 4.2 per cent, amongst the highest in the world.So according to Westpac those things have brought together consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is a good thing; it is what gives people the confidence to go out and buy goods and services to create markets for producers and keep employment opportunities ticking along. The fact that employment was strong in May is particularly good news. These were the figures that caused a bit of consternation amongst the Labor Party - that the number of jobs was growing. But jobs growth is good for Australia; new jobs are good. And the fact that the unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 per cent from the 8.6 per cent when the government came to office is actually a good thing for those Australians who want job opportunities.I think it is important that good economic policy continues so that consumer sentiment can continue - and that becomes mutually self-reinforcing. The Australian consumer was in a sunny and optimistic mood through the course of late 2001 and early 2002, notwithstanding September 11 and a number of high profile crashes. I pay tribute to the Australian consumers. They were sunny and optimistic, and that kept Australia's growth rate above that of the other industrialised economies of the world. The fact that Australia has grown strongly through this period means that we can have more jobs growth. I believe that, if the Australian economy continues to grow at 3½ to four per cent, if this government were able to accomplish its industrial relations reform agenda and if this parliament were able to seize the historic opportunity for welfare reform, we could have the kinds of unemployment outcomes that all of us would want: young people having the opportunity to work, an unemployment rate of 6.3 per cent and going lower - because it is still high - and Australians having wonderful opportunities into the future.</DOC>

 - It is my hope and it is this government's position that none of them should be refused entry, and there is one way in which none of them can be refused entry: you can pass the budget measures. There is this idea that we are going to give up fighting for our budget measures because the Australian Labor Party is engaging in opportunism. We are not. We are going to fight for our budget measures - that is why you elect governments. It is commonly said that governments sit on the Treasury bench. Why? So they can introduce budgets and they can fund government services. The Senate is not elected to bring down budgets. As it turned out, during the last election the Labor Party was not elected to government. As Mr Keating said in 1990, as Brian Howe said in 1990, as members of the Labor Party -  - who want to be seen as economically responsible are now privately saying, it would be responsible for the copayment to recover 19 per cent of the scheme, bearing in mind that Labor's benchmark was 21 per cent. That is why we hope all of those and all of the yet to be invented medicines can come onto this scheme. But the only way to ensure that they can come onto this scheme is to have this scheme work on a financially viable basis. To the Australian Labor Party we say this: it is the people who genuinely care about this scheme who care enough to reform it and make it sustainable. That is the bottom line. This idea that the Australian Labor Party cares about the scheme so much that it will oppose the measures that make it financially sustainable is a fraud. It illustrates that the Labor Party is nothing but opportunist. If you were ever to be elected and form a government, you would want to increase these fees. It would most probably be one of the first things you did. I would be very interested to know whether the Leader of the Opposition will go outside this House and give a guarantee that he will never, if he becomes Prime Minister, raise the copayment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We would be very interested in that, wouldn't we? There are 20 yards to bravery - walk outside, stand up and give this pledge: you are so opposed to increased copayments in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that you will never, as the Leader of the Labor Party, increase them. But he will not do that, because he introduced them. You introduced the copayment. You increased the non-pension concession by 36 per cent. You set the benchmark at 21 per cent and now you pretend you will be horrified if it ever goes above 15.9. We will watch to see your undertakings, but you are exposed in the Senate for the political opportunist that you are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and for his strong support of freer and fairer workplaces in the great state of Victoria. Because this government has transformed workplace relations in this country, those remaining ultramilitant union officials stand out like dinosaurs at the zoo. Victoria does have a good workplace relations system. Unfortunately, it is still bedevilled by a culture of ultramilitants, of mindless militants, in a few key unions in a few key industries. A classic case is the Japanese food giant Saizeriya, whose planned $400 million investment in jobs in Victoria has been jeopardised because of a turf war between the AMWU, which has the largest single block vote in the Victorian ALP, and the NUW, whose boss is the national president of the ALP. The State Director of the Victorian Department of State Development said:Thanks to this dispute, Victoria's reputation as a place to invest would be significantly damaged.He went on:I believe that the damage caused by the failure to stop the industrial action and the possibility that Saizeriya will not continue with this project will impact on Victoria's reputation outside of Japan.He said that because of this industrial disputation:The present value of the increase in gross state product that could be lost over the next 10 years is estimated at between $575 million and $800 million.He went on to say:Between 1,500 and 3,000 new jobs could be lost if this investment does not go ahead.Union militancy costs jobs. The situation at Saizeriya is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of lost jobs because of union militancy in Victoria. The Victorian government, it seems, is at last starting to wake up to the high price of union militancy. According to today's Age, the Victorian government is now considering whether to allow federal workplace inspectors on a Victorian government building site. Good on them. The state Minister for Major Projects has said, `The law has got to apply' - that is both the Victorian law and the Commonwealth law - and we accept that. Good on that state minister. Will his party allow him to do that, because the most militant unions are precisely the unions that bankroll the Labor Party. Over the last six years the AMWU has donated $3 million, the CFMEU has donated $2.7 million, the CEPU has donated $2 million, and they are going to dominate the Victorian ALP thanks to the Socialist Left takeover that is being engineered -  - I was asked about obstacles to better workplace performance in Victoria. Today's Age likened the Victorian Labor Party to the set of Big Brother with the contestants all struggling to work out who was going to be ejected next. - On the question of the obstacles to a better system, the Leader of the Opposition cannot decide -  - whether to rat on his mate Sword or his ally Shorten. The problem is not the fifty-fifty rule; it is the 100 per cent rule - </DOC>

 - The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is costing $4.2 billion per annum. Back in 1990, the Australian Labor Party took the view that we could not sustain $2 billion. What this government is doing is putting in place reasonable measures which any government in this position would put in place. If the Australian Labor Party had leadership, it would be putting them in place, too. In fact, when the Australian Labor Party did have leadership, it was putting them in place and everybody who was here in 1990 on the Australian Labor Party side voted for them. Everybody in the Australian Labor Party thought that was responsible and the Liberal and National parties, in opposition, supported them. That is the difference. Why? Because we know what is required to have a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.The Intergenerational Report puts forward that over the next 40 years, in current nominal dollars, the scheme will cost about $160 billion. Is there anybody in Australia who believes that the Commonwealth could run a scheme at $160 billion in today's dollars? There is nobody. There is nobody on the Labor side, nobody in the gallery, nobody in the industry and no economist who believes that. So what do we have to do? We have to start putting in place, as Paul Keating said, measures to make it sustainable, that is, $1 per week maximum for a pensioner -  - and for non-pensioners a maximum of $28.60. But that does not mean people will pay $28.60. As I have said in newspapers, for Ventolin and some such things, anything below that stays at the same price. It is a maximum; it is only when a prescription is more than that price that you pay $28.60. When we cut through all of the opportunism, both sides of politics know what has to be done. Over the years, both sides of politics have argued that it has to be done. This side of the parliament voted for it in government and in opposition. The other side of the parliament voted for it in government but now in opposition want to do the opportunistic thing. That is the bottom line. Why? Because they think there is a political advantage in making this scheme unsustainable. Perhaps they hope that it will break while we are in government and they can take the political credit for that. But the people of Australia have to know this: this is a government which is putting these measures into the Senate. This is a government which wants to pass them. We want to pass them because we want to help the health of Australia. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dawson, who has a firm commitment to families. Indeed, one of the greatest things the coalition government has done is introduce family tax benefit, which, when the new taxation system came into place, meant $2 billion extra going to two million Australian families, assisting four million Australian children. The other benefit was through the child-care benefit, which now directly contributes to over 480,000 families. The good news is that, as of 1 July, there will a 3.1 per cent increase in the amount paid for family tax benefit, again going to those two million Australian families. The maximum rate of family tax benefit part A will increase by $3.78 to bring it to an annual amount of $3,303 for a child under the age of 13, and for families with children between 13 and 15 the increase will be by $4.90, bringing it to an annual amount of $4,190. Likewise, there will be a 3.1 per cent increase to all those families receiving family tax benefit part B and the income thresholds will be raised by $950 per year to $30,806 before it affects their part A payment, and the payment will stop at an income of $83,184 for a family with one child under the age of 13. In child care, there will be another 3.1 per cent increase. Child care has been an outstanding success of the coalition government. We have 712,000 children now using some form of Commonwealth funded child care. There are more kids than ever in child care, at a cheaper cost than it has been for a long time and of a much higher quality.The member for Dawson rightly asked me whether there are any alternative policies. The only policy is the pretend policy between work and family. In child care alone, in 18 months in this parliament we have had one question from the opposition on child care. The premier women's support organisation for the Australian Labor Party is Emily's List, headed by none other than Joan Kirner. Their key priority is child care. What sort of proud record are they looking at when the federal Australian Labor Party has asked only one question in the last 18 months.Recently, a bizarre situation occurred - well intentioned, perhaps - when the member for Gellibrand was criticising the coalition, saying that not enough money was going into preschools. The interesting thing is that preschool funding - for your benefit - is the responsibility of state governments. This is an excellent opportunity for the member for Gellibrand to knock on the door of every state minister and get them to put more money into preschools. Certainly, in New South Wales it has been frozen for the last 11 years.The only family that the Labor Party are interested in is their trade union family and they are going through terrible separation pains at the moment. In a spirit of goodwill, I am happy to organise some family counselling or refer them to the Men's Line because I know there are a lot of men in the Australian Labor Party and Victorian trade union movement who need a lot of counselling.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the question was false. As the Prime Minister has already said in question time, the government is not cutting the benefits of the disability support pension. In relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which currently recovers 15.9 per cent, we are restoring that to 19 per cent of costs, which is lower than it was under the Australian Labor Party. These are measures which members of the Labor Party have, in their better moments, claimed should be taken.In relation to tax policy, we went to the last election with a tax policy; it was released on 15 October 2001. The measure that I was asked about was part of our tax policy. I notice that the Australian Labor Party now believes, having lost the election, that it has the right to defeat the government in implementing the policies that it took to the election. There used to be a doctrine that the Senate would hold the government to its election policy; the new doctrine from the Labor Party is that the Senate will force the government not to deliver on its election policy.It is not only in the area of tax where the Labor Party, having lost the election, believes it can defeat the implementation of the government's policy; it is also in the area of superannuation. The Labor Party has just defeated regulations on the Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002. It reserves the right to defeat budget measures of the significance of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As I think the Prime Minister said, this opposition not only is the most vicious in using the Senate to defeat the government but is indicative of an opposition which has still not come to terms with its election defeat. - We put our tax policy out there and we were elected on it. The opposition would be entitled to criticise us if we did not come into this parliament and move legislation to implement our policy. - No, you have not. You have come into this place and criticised us for moving to implement our policies. With all due respect to the member for Grayndler, he has just walked into the biggest political non sequitur you have ever seen. You are now demanding that the government not implement its political policy. You are not demanding that we implement it; you are demanding that we break it. - The policy was the taxation of expatriates and it was released on 15 October 2001. I will table the policy; it is the policy, released before the election, that you now demand that we break and that you are gearing up to defeat in the Senate. If the Labor Party thinks that it now has a mandate to defeat the election policies of an elected government, so be it. We do not think that the doctrine of democracy in a Westminster system extends to that degree, but so be it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question and congratulate him on his great support for environmental groups in his local area. The Australian government's Envirofund, to which the honourable member referred, is a crucial component of the $1 billion of new money that the government is putting into the Natural Heritage Trust. This is money that is going to empower small groups and individuals to repair their own local environments, whether they are city based or whether they are in outback communities. The Howard government's $20 million Envirofund provides grants of up to $30,000 through the Natural Heritage Trust for programs such as replanting native trees and shrubs, training for land carers, monitoring water quality and endangered species and restoring their habitats.I am delighted to inform the House that hundreds of groups and individuals from every Australian state and territory have responded overwhelmingly to the government's new initiative. We now have 1,751 applications for grants under the Envirofund, which is twice the level of interest shown last year for Natural Heritage Trust Fund grants of the same dimension. In other words, the government's commitment to local communities is undoubtedly lifting the interest of local communities and local groups to do something positive to restore their natural environment. It is changing the culture of communities around Australia and the Envirofund response is reflecting the fact that we are committed to a successful policy that empowers local communities to act effectively in relation to their environment.Under the first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust, we have already seen 400,000 volunteers joining the great endeavour to attack environmental problems at the local level. I thank the states for their role in administering this particular program and for monitoring the grants. By contrast, it is very disappointing that all we have heard from the opposition is attitude, platitude and a complete lack of gratitude to the 400,000 volunteers whose sweat and commitment are making a difference to Australia's environment at the local level.The Howard government is committed to an environmental policy which is based on community action, on empowering communities and on strategic investments. All we saw from the Labor Party at the last election was a policy to attack and criticise these groups, these programs, and to put these programs back in the hands of central bureaucracy. The Labor Party still takes its marching orders from Trades Hall, making it totally out of step with the aspirations of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I see that the former ACTU President cannot rise above his roots; that is the problem. What this government has made quite clear is that we believe that if state governments want federal money they should accept federal principles, and this is a position which is now more widely accepted - even by the Victorian government, as I indicated in the House yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. -  - I have got a few more than you! The honourable member for Dickson gives me an opportunity to formally advise the House of the government's decision, taken at a joint party meeting this morning, to proceed to ratification of the statute establishing the International Criminal Court. The government is attaching a number of very important stipulations to that ratification. They will further add to the guarantees that we believe already existed in relation to Australia's sovereignty in these matters. Under the principle of complementarity under the statute, an Australian charged with an offence under the code would be prosecuted and dealt with in accordance with Australian law unless Australia were judged to be either unwilling or unable to proceed with that prosecution. There is a further, very important stipulation that no Australian can be surrendered or no warrant can be issued for the arrest of an Australian citizen under the statute without the prior consent of the Attorney-General. Moreover, there will be enshrined into the legislation a proviso that no prosecution can be commenced without the consent of the Attorney-General. There will be a privative clause attached to that requirement, and that privative clause will mean that the Attorney-General's decision will not be subject to any judicial review except through the processes of the prerogative writs specified in section 75 of the Constitution. Taken together, we believe that these stipulations provide adequate and appropriate safeguards and further reinforce Australia's domestic sovereignty. I can make it very plain to the House, as I do to the Australian people, that any Australian charged within Australia or within the control of Australia - any Australian charged or alleged to have committed an offence - will be dealt with in accordance with Australian law.I also want to make it very plain, because the position of the Australian Defence Force has been raised, that ratification of the statute has the very strong support of the Australian Defence Force. I make it plain to the House that, contrary to what has been said by some, there are no circumstances, on our advice, whereby an Australian service man or woman, either in Australia or serving with Australian forces overseas and therefore under the control of Australian forces, can be charged or prosecuted with an offence other than in an Australian court or military tribunal and in accordance with Australian law. The International Criminal Court statute will make a valuable addition to the mechanisms available to the world in dealing with war crimes. It is important not to overstate its benefits; it is also important not to exaggerate any potential dangers or any potential threats to Australian sovereignty. I am personally satisfied, and the government is satisfied, that accession to the statute will not compromise Australian sovereignty, and it is on that basis that the Australian government will proceed to ratification.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I inform the honourable member that the government's economic approach over the last six years has been, firstly, to repay Labor's debt, and we have now paid about $60 billion worth; secondly, to keep inflation low; thirdly, to have low interest rates, and home mortgage interest rates are now at 6½ per cent, which is about four per cent less than what they were when the government came to office; and, fourthly, to improve business confidence, and we have introduced a new taxation system which took taxes off Australian exports for the first time, we have cut the company tax rate, we have cut capital gains tax, we have cut financial institutions duty and we have given businesses an opportunity to invest. No doubt that has been part of the reason why Australia has withstood the global downturn over the last year.But there are risks to sound economic management. The biggest risk to sound economic management in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. The biggest risk would be a Labor government, but the second biggest risk is a Labor opposition. The Labor opposition uses its numbers in the Senate to try to undermine the financial basis of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, an approach which the Labor Party in government supported. It introduced a copayment, it increased the non-concession to 36 per cent, and it wanted 21 per cent cost recovery. Yet, for straight political opportunism, it is now opposing measures to get it back to a lower level, at 19 per cent. - We have cited with approval Brian Howe; we have cited with approval Paul Keating. We would not want to leave out Barry Jones, because he is a particular authority on these matters. In the Australian today: `Labor has lost its way,' Barry Jones says. But it would not be a Barry Jones statement without a diagram. There is only one noodle here. I was wondering what it could actually refer to. I thought, `Could it refer to the build-up of interest rates under the Labor Party and the fall under the coalition? Could it refer to the build-up of unemployment under the Labor Party and the fall -   - Barry Jones says, `The party is doomed without reforms. Labor has lost its way.' It has taken a Labor Party member to give the authoritative definition of the current Leader of the Opposition. But it is not only Barry Jones. We would not want to leave out the New South Wales Labor Party. I have come across a fascinating document called `The federal election review', which was chaired by Neville Wran, of New South Wales Labor. This makes fascinating reading. Listen to what it says on interest rates:During the election, Labor did not present a credible argument or plan to demonstrate our capacity to control interest rates or to manage the economy as well as the coalition. - According to the New South Wales Labor Party, there was no credible plan on interest rates or for managing the economy. Then we flick over to GST and roll-back:We fail to realise significant sections of the electorate had adapted to the GST. Labor's proposal to simplify and roll back the GST was a failure.So we have a failure on GST. Let us flick over to taxation:The issue of Labor's lack of credible policy alternatives extended to taxation. This was the second consecutive election in which Labor failed to present a credible and comprehensive policy on taxation.So we have the issues of interest rates, no credible plan, failure of the GST roll-back and no credible policy alternative on taxation.On the television program CSI: Crime Scene Investigation you go down to the crime scene and you try to join the dots. If we were appearing on the crime scene of Labor's election failure, and the dots were these: no credible policy on interest rates, a failed taxation policy and no comprehensive taxation plan, who would be the common person in Labor's opposition who was responsible for interest rate policy, economic policy and taxation policy? Crime scene investigation: let's think about this - economic policy? That would be the shadow Treasurer, wouldn't it? Tax policy? That would be the shadow Treasurer, wouldn't it? Interest rates? That would be the shadow Treasurer. And the shadow Treasurer in the Labor opposition was?Government members - Simon Crean! - No wonder he turns his back! How would you feel if you were a member of a trade union and you were told that the 60-40 rule had to be transformed because 60-40 lost the Labor Party the election? I can imagine why some of these trade union officials are saying, `We weren't responsible for economic policy; we weren't responsible for interest rate policy; we weren't responsible for roll-back; the bloke that was gets made the leader and we get blamed for the election result.' I have got to say, it takes absolute chutzpah to do it. We have got Barry Jones, Paul Keating, Brian Howe and the New South Wales Labor Party - stop laughing, member for Werriwa -  - It leads to one place: the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to the member for Calwell that this government is absolutely 100 per cent totally committed to building the Scoresby Freeway. The Scoresby Freeway will only be built because of this government, because this government has had the guts to make a commitment to building the Scoresby Freeway. We want the Scoresby Freeway built and we want it built under principles of industrial and workplace freedom.The one thing we are very conscious of is the appalling record of the Victorian government in bringing projects in on time and on budget. The classic case is Federation Square, where the budget has blown out from $110 million to $450 million, thanks largely to industrial anarchy. We are determined to ensure that construction projects are built under the rule of law and not the law of the jungle. Members opposite should be just as committed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question. It is a very important question in the context of the very evident success of the Pacific solution. The fact is that we have had a further round of decisions handed down that began on Nauru yesterday. By the end of today, I expect that a further 400 decisions will have been handed down. This leaves less than 50 decisions to be announced, and I expect that to be done before the remainder of the month. To date, of those who have been assessed, we have had 494 approvals, or 34 per cent, and 952 refusals, or 66 per cent. That can be broken down to particular nationalities. In relation to Iraqis approved it is 412, and to Iraqis refused it is 204. The fact is that if this group of people, presenting a very similar profile to those who had landed in Australia, were assessed under our system, it would have been 90 per cent. In relation to Afghans approved it is 54, and to Afghans refused it is 697. Albeit over different time frames, the fact is that we have had approval rates of between 80 and 90 per cent for Afghans under the system operating onshore, where the `convention plus' model operates. - If you look at the others, there are 28 approvals and 51 refusals. There are very clear differences occurring in the outcomes. The point I would make is that this reflects the same pattern that emerged in Indonesia when similar cohorts were under consideration and the UNHCR was involved in the processing. The point I make about what is happening here is that a very clear signal is being sent: if you are processed offshore the arrangements will be the same as if you were processed, for instance, in Pakistan, Iran or Indonesia. It will not be what was described to me by the Indonesian minister as `the sugar'. It will not be the model that has operated over a long period of time in Australia with Australian jurisprudence, which has led to larger proportions of people being accepted as refugees who would not have been accepted if their claims had been dealt with elsewhere.This serves to demonstrate why, more importantly, we need to continue to ensure that, if people do happen to reach Australia or any of its offshore territories or islands, they are able to be processed in a situation in which they do not get access to the Australian determination system. These numbers indicate more clearly than anything else I could point out why this model has been important, the essential difference that is emerging, and why we are putting in place today arrangements that have far more integrity for ensuring that Australia - as a country that wants to assist people who are refugees in greatest need of our compassion and support - will have the opportunity to maximise places for them, because they will not have been taken by people who do not have claims of the same character.That is the situation that has operated and that is why, on World Refugee Day, I am pleased to be able to say that we honour our obligations. There will be resettlement options sought for the people on Nauru and Manus who have been found to be refugees. There have already been 59 people from Nauru resettled in New Zealand, and there will be others, with family links to Canada and I am sure to various countries in Europe, resettled. I conclude my remarks by simply saying that there is a capacity for Australia to continue to be the most generous supporter, resettling refugees who have greatest need from around the world, but we are able to do it only if we are able to maintain the integrity of our borders.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question because she wants to know why we should urgently and with vigour pursue legislation that has already passed this House today, and why in another place there ought to be support for that legislation. I know it is disorderly to respond to interjections, but I heard an interjection which raised the spectre that in some way this government is about trying to exploit divisions in the opposition over border protection. Nothing could be further from the truth. I make the point that I made in a debate earlier today: there is one way to make sure that this issue is not a matter of great political moment, and that is to support the legislation. That is all you have to do. It is not a question in which anybody would point out to you the divisions that are operating within your own party organisation, but it would enable the opposition to ensure that the Australian people knew that they were determined to protect our borders and determined to support a government that is intent on that objective.The reason for the urgency associated with this legislation is quite clear. This is a point that I have made before but I think it is worth making it again. The smugglers watch very closely what is happening in relation to Australia. They have been in a very profitable business; they are not about wanting to walk away from those profitable activities. They need to see only one vessel that indicates to them that Australia is again reopen for business and there would be so many vessels trying to follow that first one and we would again face the sorts of difficulties that we saw back in August to September when we had something in the order of 3,500 people attempting to come. We know the import of what that means. Here is a very simple measure that you could support next week in the Senate. You could move an urgency motion this afternoon to get it up in the Senate and, through you, Mr Speaker, the Labor Party could do that. Let me make the point that it would have a real impact on protecting Australia's interests. I want to conclude my remarks by saying that some people have suggested - and the Leader of the Opposition has suggested it here and elsewhere - that the fact that certain islands or external territories might be excised from our migration zone in some way compromises Australia's sovereignty.  - In some way, yes. Let me make it very clear: the legislation is an exercise of our sovereignty. That is what it is. It is an exercise of our sovereignty because it enables us to determine who accesses our migration zone and who does not. It is not an abandonment of our sovereignty; it is an exercise of sovereignty. If the opposition leader had any good sense at all, he would abandon this argument quick smart. The reason is very simple: if the argument had any cogency whatsoever, it would have applied last year in relation to Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. At that time, you could have walked away from those measures, opposed those measures, and said, `We're not prepared to be part of it. It compromises our sovereignty.' The fact is that it in no way compromised our sovereignty; it was an exercise of our sovereignty, which the opposition then supported.It is very clear that, in relation to these issues which deal with the uncertain situation that surrounds boat arrivals in the future, you need to be able to change the measures that you implement in order to remain flexible in dealing with the way in which the smugglers themselves respond. It is, I think, reasonable to recognise that you need to have a suite of measures that operate. One cannot guarantee that any particular measure is going to be more effective than any other. Last year, the member for Bowman said, when talking about coastguards when he had shadow ministerial responsibility:It is impossible to detect all such boats. I am not saying that coastguards can do that ... That is what he suggested. The Leader of the Opposition thinks I ought to be able to guarantee that any measure I propose will absolutely and in every respect ensure that nobody will reach Australia. The proposition he is asserting in relation to that would be the same as me asking him for a guarantee that his decision not to support additional excision measures will mean that people smugglers will not read this as a signal to come to Australia. That is what it is about. And the real question is whether the Leader of the Opposition can guarantee that his denial will not result in any unauthorised arrivals in Australia that might have been covered by the areas excised.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the question and, therefore, an opportunity to say very briefly to her and to the House a number of things about the HECS scheme, which I think is a good one. I remind the House that the HECS scheme was introduced by the Labor Party when it was in government. Might I remind the parliament, in the course of reminding them that it was introduced by a Labor government, that it was good policy and, because it was good policy, we supported it in opposition. That is the difference between us and you.  - When we were in opposition and you put up a good policy idea, we supported it. The contrast is that when we, in government, put up good measures, you oppose them. That is the difference. You are not only irresponsible in government, you are recklessly irresponsible in opposition, and that is the difference. -  - I am deeply remorseful. I would hate to offend anybody's sensibilities, Mr Speaker, your own included. But, Mr Speaker, may I, through you, remind the opposition that the essence of building credibility, the essence of demonstrating -  - Can I remind the opposition that the essence of building credibility as an opposition -  - and the essence of demonstrating to your former national president that you have no longer lost the way is to have a credible alternative policy. - We have embarked upon, through the process of discussion papers being released by the minister for education, a review of tertiary education policy -  - We intend to carry out that review in a careful, reflective fashion. Instead of her carping, meaningless, parrot-like interjections, could I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to participate in that review - not to make dishonest, reckless claims as you did two days ago by talking about $100,000 tertiary education fees. You were promptly shot down in flames by the vice-chancellors of Australia, who made it very plain that that was reckless nonsense. We intend to have a proper review of tertiary education policy, and we are not going to get engaged in this ridiculous ad hoc game along the way of ruling things in or out. We are going to have a proper examination and, when that examination is completed, we will be announcing policy which will be to the long-term benefit of the tertiary education institutions of this nation and to the long-term benefit of current and aspiring tertiary education students. If we are to have a proper debate about such an important sector -   - it will not be conducted in a cacophony of meaningless, stupid interjections. It will be conducted in a calm and rational manner where all of the options are on the table and where there is proper opportunity for reflective consideration before decisions are reached. That is the course that we have embarked upon, and it will take more than the pathetic interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to knock us off that course.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Like so many members on this side of the House, he often asks questions about this issue because he is concerned about it and wants a government that will keep our borders secure. The government is pursuing an active agenda of regional cooperation to combat the criminal activities of people smugglers. As I said to the House yesterday, the Bali conference was indeed a substantial watershed; a meeting that was cochaired by Indonesia and Australia and attended by something like 36 ministers from the region and a bit beyond. This process is being built on by high-level and effective cooperation with, amongst other governments, the Indonesian government. On 14 June, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, announced the expansion of cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and POLRI - the Indonesian police - and they signed an MOU which provides a framework for law enforcement collaboration in combating transnational criminal activities more generally and, of course, people-smuggling in particular.During the Bali people-smuggling conference, I announced the appointment of Ambassador Buckley as the Australian ambassador with responsibilities for people-smuggling, and he has been heavily engaged around the region pursuing the Bali outcomes. This includes the work of the two ad hoc expert groups which were established in Bali. Last week, for example, Thailand, which chairs one of the two ad hoc groups - the other is chaired by New Zealand - hosted a meeting and Ambassador Buckley joined representatives from 28 countries, as well as the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR, in a meeting that took steps towards developing cooperative processes in the area of law enforcement and legislation. These sorts of measures will help to strengthen regional approaches to the criminalisation of people-smuggling. Obviously, in time, that should make a major contribution to helping deal with this problem.The honourable member also asked whether there were any other approaches, and I think the House is familiar now with the various approaches - not the one approach, but the various approaches - which are being taken by the Australian Labor Party. What is interesting about the approach that the Leader of the Opposition takes to this issue is that he says that all of the responsibility for dealing with this problem should rest on other countries; that other countries should do more and we should do less. That, of course, is his approach to the legislation to deal with the excision of some Australian islands from the migration zone - we should do less, we should reduce our barriers and we should reduce our defences to people smugglers, but the Indonesians, the Thais and the Malaysians and so on should do more; they should get on with the job. Not only is that an entirely undiplomatic approach to dealing with this problem, it is an ineffectual approach. The approach that is going to be effective is a comprehensive approach where we ensure that a range of different measures are put in place in order to achieve the sort of effective outcomes we have had over the last six months. But the simple fact of all this is that the approach of the Labor Party is to try to undermine the message that the government is sending to people smugglers that Australia is closed to their criminal activity. I noticed, as did the Treasurer, that the former president of the Labor Party, Barry Jones, had something to say. This is a man who had the capacity to understand `noodle nation', but does not, apparently, have the capacity to understand the modern Labor Party. That says something for the complexity of the modern Labor Party. But it was all summed up by a comment the Leader of the Opposition made this morning in parliament when he said:If we genuinely want our borders secure and safe, we need a cop on the beat.I have news for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party: there is a cop on the beat, and it is the Howard government. - </DOC>

 - As always, in relation to the particular fees, the particular course and the particular university, I will check the facts before responding further. But I can tell the member for Jagajaga - and, indeed, I think the House will be interested to know - that there is something I do know very specifically about fees and that is that yesterday the Victorian minister for education announced full fee paying degrees with no loan scheme for TAFE degrees in Victoria. My recollection may be failing me, but I think the education minister in question is called Lynne Kosky, and I think the government in power there is a L-A-B-O-R government. I do not know what commitments were made before that government was elected, and I do not know whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has taken Lynne Kosky to task for breaching solidarity with the national comrades, but this is an illustration of this sort of mindless, aimless negative opposition. You have had seven months now to begin to get your act together. Barry Jones was terribly confused and muddled, but, God, he had a sort of a lovable honestly. He was one of the real characters of the Australian Labor Party. It is amazing; the passage of time makes you a little bit fonder and a little bit more charitable towards some of these people. But I was always charitable. Barry always used to try and encourage even more voracious reading habits in me. I remember he gave me a copy of War and Peace one day. He said, `I want to make absolutely certain that you re-read this, because it is the greatest book that I have ever read.'When Barry Jones speaks, most of us stop and listen. Sometimes it is hard to work out what he is saying, but you could definitely work out what he was saying this morning in the Australian; there was nothing confused about that. He said that the Labor Party had lost its way. The Labor Party has lost its way because it does not stand for anything anymore. Give me a party that stands for something, like the old-fashioned Labor Party, which stood fair and square for the values of the Australian working class and was a group of men and women who really wanted to bring about social change. But do not give me this godforsaken middle-class mob who are so mindless and opportunistic that they will oppose anything put up by a duly elected democratic government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, and in doing so I acknowledge his pioneering role in workplace relations reform in Australia. Of course, this government never wants to see anyone at all unfairly dismissed, but a handful of hard cases cannot justify a set of rules which destroy the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs. Small business is still frightened of taking new staff on, based on the perfectly understandable principle that if you cannot afford to let them go you cannot afford to take them on.The most recent survey by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants shows that 42 per cent of small businesses admit to being confused about the unfair dismissal laws; worse, 76 per cent of small business accountants think that their clients are confused about the laws; 30 per cent of small businesses think that employers always lose unfair dismissal cases and, worst of all, 30 per cent of small businesses say that the unfair dismissal laws are forcing them to take on casuals rather than permanent staff. In light of this evidence, you would think that members opposite would stop living in the past. As Barry Jones, that living national treasure, has said: Nostalgia has its value, but the ALP cannot simply be a heritage party.A heritage party run by a politburo of Labor heavies practising that good old Stalinist principle of democratic centralism! - On the subject of unfair dismissal, decent and perceptive members opposite understand that these laws are a problem, as the member for Hunter has so rightly said publicly:... my wife consistently tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals, she is fearful of going through the barrier to another level of red tape and regulation. All those perceptions are out there and all of them of well founded ... On the subject of unfair dismissal, members opposite are really quite hypocritical, because they are currently plotting the ultimate act of unfair dismissal: they are currently plotting to sack David Feeney, the secretary of the Victorian ALP, and the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Melbourne are leading the socialist-left lynch mob -   - On the question of unfair dismissal, let me quote a very good friend of some members opposite, the great Mr Bill Shorten:Mr Feeney had been a good party secretary and had a legal right to continue in the role until after the election. - There is a very serious looming unfair dismissal case concerning David Feeney. What Bill Shorten said was that clearly there is a thing called the law of contract and employment law. That is what Bill Shorten said. -  - There is this terrible looming unfair dismissal case under which Feeney will be put to the sword. That is the basic problem. David Feeney is going to be put to the sword. - I will, Mr Speaker. The basic problem is that the only job any of them over there are interested in is the secretaryship of the Victorian ALP when they are not worried about the presidency of the ALP - </DOC>

 - A welcome back to the question table for the honourable member for Corio! We have not seen him for a very long time. If that is the best he can do, he deserves another eight months in purgatory. - The reality is that Australia has a quota imposed by the United States on exports of beef of 378,214 tonnes. That is the maximum amount of beef that can be sent by Australian processors to that market in the year ahead. Because of the decline in the Japanese market there are many processors who have not traditionally supplied large quantities to the US who now want to direct some of their trade to that market. The only way that they can supply extra beef to the US is if those who have traditionally supplied to that market send less. There is only 378,000 tonnes to go around. So what I have endeavoured to do in administrating the quota is to divide it up as fairly as possible amongst all of those who would like to supply beef to the US. There are some who argue that, because the Japanese market has gone soft, they should be granted access to the US market at the expense of those who built their business on that particular market. I have no objection with market forces prevailing and one business taking trade from another fairly and squarely. But I do have a philosophical problem with the idea that the government should intervene and suggest to one company that it should extinguish its contracts to enable another one to enter that market for the first time.When the Red Meat Advisory Council came to me with a 14-point proposal that would have effectively given very substantial windfall gains to many companies who had not been active in that market in the past but took away significant shares of the quota from those who had been active in the trade, I felt that situation was unfair. I was prepared to accept some transfer of quota away from the US suppliers towards those who had been interested in the market, but I felt it was reasonable for that share to be capped. So I limited the gains to 140 per cent and the losses so that no company would supply less than 85 per cent. I think that was a pretty fair treatment and a lot of processors agree with me. Of course no-one is completely happy. They would all like to have sent very much more to the US. I would like them to send more to the US. The real culprit in this whole exercise is the United States and its restriction on trade that prevents Australian producers from supplying our product to that market. That is the real culprit. The only way that I can create jobs in abattoirs that want to build a market in the US is to take those jobs away from those who are currently supplying to that market. I challenge the member for Corio to tell me which abattoirs I should take the jobs away from so that this quota can be given to his mates. Which jobs should I take away? - As always, I find members offer silence when that question is asked. - The reality is it is impossible to deliver as much quota to everyone as we would wish. But what we have endeavoured to do is to divide the pain as fairly as possible. I believe we have been successful in that objective.</DOC>

I had the pleasure of participating in a community forum on ageing in his electorate recently and of conducting a roundtable with aged care providers in his electorate. As the member for Cook alluded to, the recent census figures indicate the continuing ageing of the Australian population. - For example, the proportion of people over the age of 65 years has increased since the last census from 12.1 per cent of the population to 12.6 per cent of the population last year. The current projections are that by the year 2021 the proportion of Australians over the age of 65 will be in the order of 18 to 19 per cent. Indeed, I note that the proportion of Australians over the age of 65 in the member for Cook's electorate is already 19 per cent and so, in a sense, it has the demographic profile of Australia in 20 years time, generally.It is because of this ageing of the population, which is borne out by the census, that this government are putting into place programs and policies to address an ageing population. A part of those programs and policies is to make an intergenerational investment in Australia. That is why the government are committed to aged care, why we are currently spending some $5,000 million a year on aged care programs in Australia and why we have increased aged care funding in this year's budget by some $500 million.The honourable member asked me about the increase in aged care places. This year we will allocate nationally an additional 8,231 places, worth an additional $180 million in recurrent funding for aged care. This brings the number of places which we have allocated since the year 2000 to over 32,000. In the region which is covered by the honourable member for Cook's electorate, in this year's allocation there will be an additional 190 places, including an extra 190 beds and 30 community aged care places. In fact, it brings to over 800 the number of places allocated in the last 2½ years to the region, which includes the honourable member for Cook's electorate. He also asked me whether or not there would be special priority given to beds which are already built. That will be the case this year. There is a community desire to bring beds on stream as quickly as possible. The government is working towards that objective and where beds have already been built, provided the other criteria are already being met, those beds will be given some priority this year. This, of course, stands in stark contrast to the Labor Party, which had no strategy for an ageing Australia.</DOC>

 - I particularly want to make some comments on this because the claims in relation to St Merryns and the Mudgee abattoir, which happens to be in my electorate -  - The point that I want to make is that the claim in relation to St Merryns pulling out of a proposal to purchase the Mudgee abattoir, which happens to be in my electorate, is illustrative of the gross misrepresentations that the Labor Party and others have chosen to impose upon the very difficult decision that the minister for agriculture has had to make. They were decisions that people would have preferred him not to have had to make, but which ought not to -  -  - Well, of course we would not have. We would have liked the quota to have been big enough. And who negotiated the quota for us now to have been presented with this problem? - This is an important point. In this instance, the claim has been made that the Mudgee abattoir may now fail because the sale has fallen through to St Merryns, a UK based company, because of the lack of beef quotas. Mudgee is a service abattoir. The beef access quotas that they have into the United States are held by those who use the boning rooms, not by the abattoir. I have been deeply involved in the negotiations, as the local member. Indeed, any local member here would seek to facilitate an important opportunity like this for more jobs. - He was implying quite clearly -  - I make the point that there is no financial interest in this for me whatsoever. I am seeking to secure the jobs of 400-plus people in my own electorate. - I find the imputation over there that I somehow am going to benefit from this highly offensive and I ask that it be withdrawn. - He was gesturing with his fingers, clearly implying that I was going to benefit financially. - To return to the substance of the issue - in this particular case, in all of the negotiations with my office, with Invest Australia, and with people at Mudgee, right until the very point of time at which a decision was made, there was no indication from St Merryns that the issue of US beef quotas was of any interest to them whatsoever. It is quite apparent to me that there are other reasons for them withdrawing from the contract, and it was an outrageous claim by St Merryns -   - The point is being made that jobs could be lost. Here is a classic example where that claim has been made, but it is not the fault of the agriculture minister and it does not relate to the US beef quota issue. I just want to make some other general points. The shadow minister plainly seeks to imply now that they can somehow be of great importance and significance to the Australian beef industry. I think it is worth remembering just a few basics. Firstly, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister for agriculture in Australia, for the service over which he had control, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, annual bills for the red-meat sector alone were $140 million. In a much larger interest today, this year the red-meat industry will pay just $30 million. Now, if that has not guaranteed a lot of jobs, I do not know what has. - The Leader of the Opposition asked who put the reforms in place. There were a lot needed. - I did, as a matter of fact. It is as simple as that. Any checking of the record books will reveal that we did. Then you come to another issue that threatens jobs in this industry - the tally system. Do you remember that they had an industrial relations minister whose name was Senator Peter Cook -  - The then minister for industrial relations, Senator Cook, recognised as part of his responsibilities that the tally system ought to go. That was widely recognised as costing a lot of jobs in the meat industry. Who opposed it? The then leader of the ACTU - not then a member of parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question in relation to funding for Queensland state government schools and, in particular, his very strong advocacy to me for the Blair State School. Honourable members would be aware that in this budget the Commonwealth government increased its funding to state government schools by 5.7 per cent - a 52 per cent increase in funding in six years, during which period of time we have had a 1.4 per cent growth in enrolments in the state government system. Honourable members should remember, though, that state schools are called state schools because they are administered, managed and funded by state governments. In fact, in support of that -   - the Queensland Minister for Education, Anna Bligh, told radio 4QR in Brisbane on 4 June this year:You see the Commonwealth doesn't actually run state schools, state governments do.In fact, if I wanted to go to the Blair State School, I would have to write a letter to Anna Bligh and I would have to say, `Dear Ms Bligh, please may I visit the Blair State School?' These schools are funded, run and administered by state governments. But the Queensland minister in the Queensland parliament, the day after the Commonwealth budget was announced, criticised the Commonwealth government for delivering a 6.2 per cent increase in funding to support Queensland state government schools. In fact, the member for Jagajaga joined her in this and was highly critical of the Commonwealth budget as well. Of the federal budget, she said to John Faine on 3LO in Melbourne on 15 May, again the day after the budget:There was no additional real funding for education, for public education at all in this budget.`No extra real money at all,' she said. We, the Commonwealth government, announced this year in fact not a 6.2 per cent but a 5.8 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding to support Queensland state schools, to top up the Queensland government funding of state schools. So when the Queensland government announced -  - its budget on Tuesday, having had the Queensland minister say that she thought that 6.2 per cent would be a totally inadequate increase, what might you think the Queensland government would have done in increasing its funding to its state schools? Hands up those who think that it might have increased it by 6.2 per cent? Okay, we have got a 6.2 per cent over here. No other takers for 6.2? - So you would think, Mr Speaker -  - So we are in a situation where - just to recap; this is a very important point - the Queensland Minister for Education says that 6.2 per cent is outrageously inadequate. The member for Jagajaga then describes the Commonwealth's increase for Australian state government schools at 5.7 per cent as `no real increase at all'. So Mr Beattie, who proclaims to be developing a knowledge state, so to speak, announces a three per cent increase in funding for Queensland state government schools - in other words, when you take into account inflation, barely any increase at all. I have been standing by my fax machine and I have been waiting for the member for Jagajaga to condemn the Queensland government for its totally inadequate increase in funding to its schools. If the member for Jagajaga thinks that a 5.8 per cent increase is no increase at all, how would the member for Jagajaga describe a three per cent increase? - How many teachers would that fund? How many computers would it put into schools? What would it do for the 50 per cent of Aboriginal kids in the state of Queensland that cannot pass the literacy tests? This is the kind of hypocrisy that we get from the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition is there with his sandwich board on - he has got a message for the policy frontiersmen down there with the member for Werriwa; he has got another message on the other side of his 50-50 sandwich board. I wonder which end of the sandwich board he is pointing towards Queensland today. As the Prime Minister said earlier today, I would love to know what the member for Jagajaga thinks about the full fees for TAFE in Victoria that were introduced by the Victorian government today for which no loan scheme exists. Give us the answer to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I indicate to him again that, as I thought I had indicated in the last answer, I do not believe the reason St Merryns have given. Obviously I have a real interest in this matter because it affects my constituents. I want to see the jobs that exist at that abattoir preserved and I have been very keen to pursue, in a perfectly legitimate way, as any other person in this House would, the various things that St Merryns and the abattoir have asked me to do, including asking Invest Australia to look closely at the requests made of it. Neither Invest Australia, my office, nor Mudgee were told at any time, until the deal fell over, that the issue of US quotas had anything to do with their proposal. They did not tell Invest Australia, they did not tell me, they did not tell my office, and they did not tell the Mudgee Shire Council, so far as I am aware. I view the matter so seriously because I deeply suspect that I, and the government, and the minister are being set up as scapegoats -   -  - I do. I have had a little experience in the airline industry. - It sometimes happens that people make commercial decisions for reasons which they do not particularly seem to want in the public arena and then they try to scapegoat governments or government ministers. I indicate that I have written a very stiff letter indeed to the CEO of Merryn Meats demanding an explanation, because I do not believe the reason they have given. I have explained that to John Harvie from the Mudgee abattoir, and I say again that I think you have fallen into the trap of seeking to blame the government, and the minister, for a very difficult decision that arises as a result of American trade practices. That is where this problem emanates. It is as simple as that. The industry wanted the minister to intervene. He has done so in a way that reflects exhaustive consultation in the face of a very difficult situation. I stand by the decision making process that he has been through, the consultation he has been through, recognising that not everyone can be happy with it. It is an impossible situation, and your cheapjack exploitation of it does you no justice whatsoever, as exemplified by your attempt to exploit the St Merryns withdrawal which, as I say, is based on grounds which I simply do not believe and which you have prematurely accepted. </DOC>

 - This government is very much aware and committed to building a modern Australia and appreciates, as does the member for Boothby, that for the 21st century, information, education, knowledge, innovation and the commercialising of ideas are absolutely critical to our future. In fact, within the $3 billion program - the Backing Australia's Ability statement - are a number of critically important initiatives in relation to excellence. The fact that the Australian Labor Party has absolutely no interest in innovation or Australia's future should be noted by those who are listening to this broadcast. For example, this year I have announced funding of $19 million for the Cooperative Research Centre for the Australian Sheep Industry at the University of New England in Armidale to look specifically at wool and meat and to add value to important traditional commodities. Perhaps more importantly for the member for Boothby, when I was in Adelaide the South Australian minister, Jane Lomax-Smith, and I announced the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics - a $20 million commitment on behalf of the Commonwealth - which is a collaborative project with Melbourne University and the University of Queensland to look specifically at disease and salt resistance in grains. This is, of course, an $8 billion industry, as the Deputy Prime Minister would be well aware. Tasmanians benefited from the bioinformatics centre of excellence - computers, mathematics, statistics, information technology, and specifically applying those things to biology and medicine. Last month, with Senator Alston, I had the privilege of announcing a $129 million project, a national centre for excellence in information and communication technology. We expect to leverage another $100 million from that project from the universities and the private sector. As I said at the time, at the former Eveleigh railway yards, new technologies are the railway lines for the 21st century, and this government in particular is totally committed to seeing that Australians have a bright and confident future. With $3 billion of specific investment in innovation, in new research and ideas, we expect to leverage another $6 billion from the private sector over a five-year period. Whilst the Australian Labor Party had been talking about noodle nation and the member for Brand has committed every working minute of every working day to it, this government is actually on with the business of delivering a modern Australia and giving hopeful confidence to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I would be very happy to see politics taken out of the car industry. In particular, I would be very happy to see union politics taken out of the car industry. The only threat to 50,000 jobs in the motor industry right now is the AMWU, which has been holding this industry to ransom. Three times in the last 12 months the AMWU has stopped the motor industry in pursuit of its own political objectives. Let me quote an editorial from the Advertiser, which says:It remains clear that the AMWU has deliberately laid siege to the industry in its most vulnerable areas. A relative handful of strikers, at the behest of their union, have put at risk thousands of their fellow workers.The only threat to jobs in the motor industry is the AMWU and the members opposite, who have been donated $3 million by this particular rogue union in the last six years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. Of course, the member for Boothby takes a great deal of interest in the workers of the auto sector, particularly in South Australia. We have already been exporting cars from South Australia to the United States, and our government and our policies have established a trading and economic environment that has seen Australia's export earnings go from $99 billion to $154 billion since 1996. It was great to see the announcement at the end of last week that Holden has secured a deal that will see the Australian car manufacturer export 18,000 Monaros per year to the United States of America. Not only are we are selling rice to Japan and exporting camels back to the Middle East; we are also exporting cars to the United States of America. This is a great outcome for the industry.The Monaro, which will be rebadged for the US market as a Pontiac GTO, is being targeted at the high performance or muscle end of the car market. We suggest that the member for Werriwa might buy one of these cars. The deal is going to add around $500 million a year to the already fantastic export earnings of the auto sector. Last year it earned about $4.9 billion for the Australian economy. This will take it well past $5 billion, and we will be well on track to meet our target of $6 billion by 2005. It will also add hundreds of new jobs to Holden's already 8,000-strong work force. We have been focused, as far as the government are concerned, on putting in place policies that generate jobs - 972,000 jobs since we came into office. Certainly in this particular industry our policies have absolutely sustained the fantastic growth in export earnings for the auto sector.I also indicated to the House last week some of the concerns of the auto sector in terms of the future of exports, particularly from the CEO of Holden and the President of Ford, with regard to some of the illegal strike action that has taken place in this industry. We have seen the bloody-minded attitude of some in the union movement towards this industry. We have seen comments from union organisers like Mr Tim Murray, who was reported in the Australian newspaper on 1 May. I will not repeat exactly what he said, but he said that he did not give a four-letter word about the industry; he did not care whether the industry closed down as a result of strike action. He said that he believed legal return to work orders were `BS'. Unions have no regard for the legal structures in this country.This illegal strike action could put at risk the 7,000 auto workers' jobs in the electorates of Labor members of this House. You would think that Labor members of this House would have some regard for the jobs of their constituents. Just out of interest, the member for Batman has 110 auto jobs in his electorate; the member for Ballarat, 800 jobs; the member for Bass, 510 jobs; the member for Blaxland, 250 jobs; the member for Calwell, 740 jobs; the member for Chisholm, 400 jobs; the member for Gellibrand, 290; the member for Greenway, 200; the member for Holt, 100; the member for Isaacs, 540; the member for Kingston, 823; the member for Melbourne Ports, 850; the member for Port Adelaide, 585; the member for Scullin, 250; and of course the member for Hotham, the Leader of the Opposition, 520 jobs.So whilst the member for Hotham is out negotiating with the unions about getting the 60-40 rule down to 50-50, which will not really mean a great deal, he might also negotiate with the union movement that they do not put the export earnings of the auto industry at risk and he might negotiate with the union movement - with Doug Cameron and Tim Murray - that they do not put at risk the jobs of all those workers in the electorates that are represented by the Australian Labor Party. Our government take very seriously our responsibility in representing this sector, as does the member for Boothby. It is a significant question as to whether members of the Australian Labor Party do exactly the same.</DOC>

 - The last thing I would do is encourage confrontation. -  - The only people who are trying to encourage confrontation in the motor industry are the leaders of the AMWU. Let me quote from an editorial in the Financial Review:No industrial organisation has done more in recent times to resurrect Australia's reputation abroad for cutting off its nose to spite its face through bloody-minded strikes and pickets than this rogue union - that is, the AMWU. If you want to quote Bob Herbert, I will quote Bob Herbert. He said in a letter which the Leader of the Opposition would have received on Friday:We are concerned that, based on recent experiences in the vehicle industry, there are those in the trade unions who have little regard for the industrial laws.That is the problem: consistent breach of the workplace relations laws by the AMWU, supported of course by members opposite who are completely in the pockets of the rogue militant unions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I can inform the House that it is very important that this parliament enact measures to ensure the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In 1990, a copayment of $2.50 was introduced by the Labor Party on the basis of making the scheme sustainable. It was passed into law with the support of the opposition: the coalition parties in the Senate. The nonconcessional copayment when Labor came to office was $4 and by the time Labor left office it was $16.80. It had increased by 4.2 times.It is important, if Australians want access to subsidised pharmaceuticals, that this be put on a sustainable financial basis. As the Intergenerational Report says, as a proportion of GDP, there is no other area of Commonwealth expenditure which will grow faster than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, increasing to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 40 years time. So those people who are genuinely concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will support those measures to make it sustainable. That used to be the Labor Party's position. After all, it introduced the copayment, so we know it is not against the copayment.I am asked whether there are any alternative proposals that are being put around in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I came across one while listening to the Sunday Sunrise program on Sunday. The Leader of the Opposition was fresh back from his triumph at the Western Australian Labor Party conference, which gave new meaning to the 50-50 rule: the 50-50 rule at a Labor Party conference means 50 per cent of the delegates deliver the standing ovation standing and 50 per cent deliver the standing ovation while they are sitting. - They were sitting on the outside, but no doubt standing on the inside. - He normally turns his back around at this point, Mr Speaker. Yes, resuming conversations is very important at this point. - The Leader of the Opposition was asked on the Sunday Sunrise program:If you became Prime Minister, would you give us a guarantee this morning that you would not increase the PBS co-payment?Is that a fair question? After all, he is absolutely opposed to it - so opposed to it that he is voting it down in the Senate. The answer was: `We introduced the copayment.' The interview goes on:Glenn Milne: No, will you give us a guarantee?Simon Crean: Hang on, let me address the question ... We introduced ... Glenn Milne: Well, it's a fair question, isn't it?Simon Crean: We introduced the co-payment ...So he is asked: `Will you give us a guarantee not to increase it?' And he says, `Oh no, we introduced it.' So the policy was to introduce it when Labor were in government: `We won't pledge we won't increase it if Labor ever returns to government. The principle is we'll only vote against it while the coalition is in office.' Is it any wonder that the Australian Labor Party have now run out of economic credibility? They are in favour of copayments when they are in office, they reserve the right to increase them if they ever return and they only vote against them while the coalition is in office.The mystery became even deeper this morning at the doors. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked the same question. According to AAP, when asked if she could rule out raising PBS copayments if Labor were in government, Ms Macklin replied:We're opposing the government's proposition at the moment.That's where the debate is at this stage.Can we just ask that the moment pass very quickly, please. We will re-introduce the measures, you can return to what has always been your policy and we can end the debate. There is no in principle opposition to the copayment on the part of the Labor Party. They will not rule out increasing the copayment if they ever return to office. They are opposing it at the moment for opportunism. Why don't they do the right thing by the people of Australia?</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. - I thought it was the Brindabellas. Unlike those who sit opposite, our government does have an industrial relations reform agenda. Quite rightly, that reform agenda was identified again on radio this morning. The chief of the Australian Industry Group, Bob Herbert, again highlighted the industrial relations reforms that are needed in the car industry. I have made no suggestion that car industry support will be cut as a result of industrial action, but I can tell you that a number of other people have suggested in their submissions that there needs to be industrial relations reform in the car industry if that car industry is to grow and prosper. Bob Herbert, in the Australian Industry Group submission, called for things like secret ballots and cooling-off periods and allowing the commissioner to intervene. Last week we had the economic writer in the Australian saying that the great fear of the car industry is not tariff cuts but the next enterprise bargaining wage round. To those who have commented on the next car industry package, let me say that there are a number of people who are arguing the case. The next car industry package will be determined by the due process of government, based on the submissions to the Productivity Commission inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I am aware of a Federal Court decision last Friday which gives the green light to compulsory union levies, which gives the green light to a form of industrial conscription, which unions are interested in to reverse the calamitous decline of membership over the last decade. If this decision is not reversed by legislation or on appeal, hundreds of thousands of Australian workers will be subject to a union tax of $500 a year. This is compulsory unionism by the back door. It is an attempt by certain militant unions to go back to the bad old days of `no ticket, no start'. This idea that you can demand payment for so-called services that have not been requested in advance is nothing but a scam. If a business tried to do this, it would be guilty of an offence under the trade practices legislation.I have been asked about alternative policy. Let me quote the most successful Labor leader of recent times, Premier Bob Carr. He rightly said:You can't put a tax on other members of the workforce and a state can't require the collection of union fees from non-unionists.Not surprisingly, in this as in so many things, the Leader of the Opposition has shown a lot less backbone. Predictably, the Leader of the Opposition supported the right of unions to demand money from strangers. In doing that he did not declare a pecuniary interest even though the 10 largest union donors have given $27 million to the Labor Party in the last six years. The member for Hotham did not declare a personal interest even though he was only able to man his polling booths because the unions bussed in workers. - The unions did not just bus in the workers, they bussed in the local member. - Mr Speaker, this is entirely relevant. It is about the hold that the unions have. The member for Hotham is one of the very few members of this place who have never lived in their own electorate. - This government is determined to protect freedom of association. This government has legislation in the parliament and if members opposite were determined to protect the ordinary rights of Australian workers to join or not to join trade unions they would support the government's compulsory union levy bill.</DOC>

 - I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition is anxious to curry favour with union leaders today because on the weekend no less a person than the leader of the CFMEU in Western Australia, Kevin Reynolds, said:I personally haven't been very impressed with his leadership. - Kevin Reynolds said:It was a disaster the day Kim Beazley gave it away. I only wish he'd come back. - The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, after being invited back by Kevin Reynolds, was quoted in the Canberra Times. He said:I have given myself 12 months to think it over. I do not reject the idea that I would contest again. - On the subject of the Industrial Relations Commission -  - Let me make it very plain. The BHP Western Port dispute ended at precisely the moment the unions concerned were threatened with powerful sanctions under the government's Workplace Relations Act. The dispute ended when the unions were in breach of an injunction from the Federal Court and were threatened with sanctions for breach of that injunction. That was the point at which the dispute ended. I am all in favour of giving the Australian Industrial Relations Commission more power to order cooling off periods in the event of intractable industrial disputes. If members opposite were serious about helping the Industrial Relations Commission to resolve industrial disputes they would support the genuine bargaining bill that this government has before the parliament now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I know of his interest in these matters. I recently had the opportunity in his electorate of talking to a large number of people about these issues. In relation to the very specific question he asked, we have received information from a variety of sources and, in putting that together, it gives us a picture of what is happening in Indonesia at this time.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have told us that they have made findings in relation to a number of people who have approached them. It is in the order of 500 people. The UNHCR are now seeking to find places for them in resettlement programs abroad or away from Indonesia. It is also estimated that another 1,500 people, and possibly more, either are in Indonesia with the International Organisation for Migration or, if they have not made contact with the IOM, remain in the country seeking various outcomes. Obviously, those in the hands of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are waiting for resettlement; others have been electing to go home. I think the IOM at the moment have something in the order of 170 people - Afghans in the main - waiting to be repatriated. Some are still waiting to be processed, but others are waiting to travel unlawfully to Australia or to other countries.A year ago our estimates were that there could have been as many as 3½ thousand people in that position, and the Indonesian government thought at one time that there were as many as 5,000 people in that position. The implication of that is very clear - that is, the measures that we have been implementing have been having some effect, and that has been a very important outcome. You have to ask yourself: why, when you have measures that are having a positive impact and protecting your interests, would you want to walk away from them? That to me is the most important question that the opposition has to answer at this time.A number of measures play a part in sending a very strong message to people smugglers. They include Operation Relex; mandatory detention; the ability to ensure that people are able to be processed and, if they are found not to be refugees, to be removed from Australia; and the capacity to be able to land people - particularly if you are not able to return them - in places that are excised from our migration zone, such as Christmas Island, Cocos Island and the Ashmore-Cartier reef, and to be able to process them where they cannot access a determination system which is inevitably more generous or which some people believe will lead to very different outcomes in terms of whether or not they are found to be refugees. - Yes, I will acknowledge the role of the Federal Police and others. It is a multiplicity of measures that we have been taking. The opposition see these measures as being somewhat like a menu: that they can pick and choose. They say, `We think that some work and that we can put the others to one side,' as if you could wait and pick them up at another time if you wished. The fact is that the totality of those measures has been working and, particularly in relation to the question of excision -  - you know that excision has never been an abandonment of Australian sovereignty. You were prepared to accept excision in relation to Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Ashmore Reef. I notice that the member for Werriwa said on Friday night that he did not see it as being terribly significant that they were excised from the migration zone because they were closer to Indonesia, and he was almost prepared to say that they ought to be part of Indonesian territory, not ours. The fact is that there are people intent on travelling without authority into this region. The fact is that we have had advice that there ought to be additional excisions in order to ensure that those arrangements continue to work to our benefit. They are not an abandonment of our sovereignty. It is an exercise of our sovereignty. But where does the Labor Party stand on this matter? -  - Yes, the Labor Party are about surrendering. The Labor Party are about surrendering to the people smugglers and abandoning Australia to their aspirations to bring people here without authority - unless you think that this is in some way an aberration. If you think that the Leader of the Opposition is really still serious about border protection, look at what he and his party are now saying about mandatory detention. The Labor Party are now saying, `We think mandatory detention is only necessary to identify people for security purposes and for character assessment, not for processing and not for holding people for removal. It is only necessary for those purposes.' Every time the Labor Party go down that route and give succour to the people smugglers - not defending before their own councils the policy that they have supported and adopted over the years, walking away from it; not prepared to take the argument up to them - we see the Labor Party wanting to adopt failed policies that have been implemented elsewhere. We know that, when you allow your system to be overrun with large numbers of asylum seekers -  -  - You know that you only have to look at what has been happening in Europe. You know -  - Mr Speaker, I simply want to make this point -  - Essentially, mandatory detention has enabled us to have people properly processed. If they are found to be refugees, we honour those obligations. It means that, if people are found not to be refugees - and we have a large number of people like that held in detention now - we have them available for removal. We know the alternative policies that have been implemented, particularly in Europe, and which they are now questioning. In Britain and France, they can tell you what happens. If you process people and you do not have them available for removal, what you find is that you have something like they are faced with in Britain now: 270,000 people who have simply disappeared and are not available for removal. In France, they admit that, in all of the studies that they have undertaken, 90 per cent of failed asylum seekers disappear into the community.I would admit that Australia has been very different in relation to those matters. I would admit that when Labor was in office - and perhaps for the member for Grayndler it is a matter of noting this - there were very low rates of apprehension of people who were unlawful in the Australian community. But we have lifted that up to the point where one in four unlawfuls in the Australian community are located every year. We have been able to deal with these issues very successfully. - I think it is important that the Labor Party do not forget the lessons of the past. I think they ought to get a bit of resolve and decide that they are going to go into their own party councils and defend the policies that they know work, instead of abdicating in relation to border control.</DOC>

 - One of the most direct things that the government did to help Australians with bank fees is that we abolished $1.2 billion of financial institutions duty. - One of the brains trust of the Labor Party then says, `You gave them GST.' There is no GST on financial services.  - Oh, a small problem: so now it is on other things. - You asked me about financial services. I give you the answer that this government very directly abolished $1.2 billion of financial institutions duty, which was not supported by the Labor Party. In addition, we have a program for the abolition of the other remaining tax on banks - the bank account debits tax - and an agreement with the states for that to be abolished in a couple of years time; so that is very direct relief for Australian families in relation to fees.In relation to the fees which the banks themselves charge - not taxes; they are not charged by the Commonwealth or in addition to the states - as I said on Friday, I believe that there are many of those products which are offered by the banks where the fees are high. They are too high for the people who are using them. That is why I think it is very important that new products are introduced, for example, the no-fee accounts which allow up to a number of transactions for no fees. In addition - I do not want to name all of the companies - I notice that there is currently advertising on the television screens of Australia a new foreign entrant which advertises accounts for no fees for unlimited transactions. It is a very good product for people who are worried about fees to take up. I understand that the take-up in relation to that new foreign entrant has been quite substantial for those reasons.The most important thing for the consumer is to get the kind of product which will not charge fees or will charge fees only where the consumer is doing exceptionally unusual transactions over and above the normal deposits and withdrawals. In addition to that, the government says that it is open in relation to any evidence of breaches of the Trade Practices Act or of improper pricing or of lack of competition or of collusion between the banks being examined in its entirety. I may also point out to the House that the government's invitation to the Reserve Bank of Australia to look at credit card interchange fees is, I believe, yielding some substantial results. That has not yet run its full course, and obviously there is a great deal of resistance. Additionally in relation to that, the opening up of that sector to new competitive forces has the potential to bring benefits for consumers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I know how well he represents the people of that electorate in this place, on issues including that of engagement with Asia. The Secretary-General of ASEAN, Rodolfo Severino, visited Australia last week, and we had excellent discussions with him. He also met with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade, me and others. In our discussions we focused particularly on the issues of key importance to Australia and ASEAN: cooperation between a number of ASEAN countries and Australia on the issue of countering terrorism; a range of transnational issues, and obviously, in particular, people-smuggling. We had extensive discussions on trade between Australia and ASEAN and, in particular, on the emerging closer economic partnership between ASEAN and Australia.I was impressed and pleased to see that Mr Severino in an interview a day or so later in the Australian Financial Review said he could not see how any country could be closer to ASEAN than Australia is. The fact is that the cooperation between ASEAN and Australia has been excellent on a range of very difficult issues over recent times. I particularly refer to the issue of people-smuggling. I note that Mr Severino congratulated Australia as well as Indonesia for co-hosting the Bali people-smuggling conference which was held in February. I explained to Mr Severino that the two ad hoc expert groups established in Bali will play a critical role in strengthening regional measures to criminalise and combat people-smuggling. The fact is that the relationship on difficult regional issues, not least people-smuggling, is emerging as a very strong relationship between Australia and ASEAN.The member for Maranoa asked if there were any alternative approaches. There is, of course, the Labor Party's approach, in particular the Labor Party's approach to people-smuggling. I noticed back in February that the Leader of the Opposition said:No-one that I have heard has argued for the abolition of mandatory detention.That was in February. Since then, the New South Wales Labor Party has voted against mandatory detention, the Queensland Labor Party has voted against mandatory detention, and this weekend - when a few people stood up and gave the Leader of the Opposition a standing ovation and many others sat down - the Labor Party in Western Australia said that it would only support the current system of mandatory detention with an initial custodial appraisal followed by accommodation in community settings. Even the Western Australian division of the Labor Party is walking away from a policy which sometimes, but not always, is professed to be the policy of the parliamentary Labor Party.Anybody who watched the Leader of the Opposition on Sunrise yesterday - and I did squeeze in a glance at it before going off to play golf and doing something much more constructive than watching the Leader of the Opposition, although my score at golf was about as bad as his on television - would have seen the Leader of the Opposition once more make the point that Labor has started to make: that other countries in our region need to do more to address people-smuggling so that Australia can do less. That, ultimately, is the Labor Party's approach - or at least that of most people in the Labor Party. The member for Werriwa stood up in this House on Thursday, frankly in contradiction to the Labor Party's current position, and was out there arguing what a good thing mandatory detention was. He said:After all, it was a Labor government, the Keating government, that established mandatory detention in this country ... This was one of the proud achievements of the Keating administration ...This coming from a man who today said to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs: `Hand in your badge, Adolf.' In other words, he was accusing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs of being Hitler-like, when he himself professes to be a supporter of mandatory detention, and the Leader of the Opposition has no idea what his position is at all. - The simple fact is that Barry Jones was dead right: the Labor Party has lost its way, and I think further evidence of that was in the Canberra Times at the weekend. There was a very warm and heartfelt interview with the member for Brand. Buried in that story - and what a warm story it was! - the member for Brand said:'I have given myself 12 months to think it over. I do not reject the idea that I would contest - the seat of Brand - again.'He is giving it 12 months to think it over, to see how hopeless you are in the next 12 months.</DOC>

 - I do not know that the Labor Party has a plan to regulate bank profits. If it does, I would be very happy to hear it. If you object to banks making profits perhaps you could tell us what your plan for regulating profit outcomes is. I am sure the people of Australia would be interested to know it. In 1949 the plan was to nationalise the banks. - Their frontbench just interjected, `Chif was right.' If it is the plan of the Labor Party to nationalise the banks - and I see the shadow Treasurer nodding - then we would be interested to know it. - If the member wants to get up and read out the profits of the banks in her question, we are entitled to refer to it. It is absolutely relevant. - Can I point out to her that some of the banks that she mentioned have a number of transactions per month for no fees. They may be appropriate for people. With some of the foreign banks that she mentioned you do not need branches; you can invest without fees.  - In addition to that can I say that the member focuses only on banks. We have found on this side of the House that one of the good financial institutions is credit unions, actually, and I am sure there would be some credit unions in Launceston. - Launceston is presumably a town that you are interested in. One of the things we on this side of the House actually did in relation to credit unions was to give them access to cheque accounts and entry into the payment system, which was something that the Labor Party had not managed to get around to doing in its 13 years in government. Incidentally, there is another thing the Labor Party never did in 13 years of government: it never actually fixed bank fees, surprisingly enough. -  - Not in year one, two, three, four or right up to year 13. - It wasn't a problem under the Labor Party! No, the Labor Party did not have to fix them because it was not a problem under the Labor Party! - By definition, if Labor is in power, nothing is a problem, according to the member for Melbourne. It is like the PBS - that was not a problem when Labor was in power, either. -  - Can I reaffirm that in the 13 years of Labor government there was no price setting in relation to fees. Labor's interest is either newfound or they concur with the member for Melbourne that there was no problem under Labor, by definition, because Labor was in government. But I recommend that credit unions and other financial institutions, which under our reforms are now regulated on a national basis with prudential regulation, do actually give much better services than banks. I know one of the things that the member might look at that I have found very successful in my electorate is the Bendigo Bank community bank. If you can get together a group of business people who are prepared to give their custom to the Bendigo Bank, the Bendigo Bank will move in and offer that service to a particular community with the prudential regulation that it engages in. I know on this side of the House that members have found that to be a very practical outcome, and we recommend that to the Labor Party. Sometimes members can be pretty useful in helping the community get together and get better banking services.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. I was thinking only on Friday, when he was speaking to me about the University of Queensland, that the only more vigorous and constructive advocate for the University of Queensland than its Vice-Chancellor, Professor John Hay, is of course the member for Ryan. When Sir Winston Churchill went to address Harvard University in September 1943 he said, in a rather prescient address, that the empires of the future would be `empires of the mind'. As a nation we have crossed a threshold from the 20th to the 21st century, and this government is thinking in particular of not only how we add value to traditional commodities with ideas and education but also how we support emerging new industries. That is why reform of Australian universities is so important. Reform to or fixing and changing Australian higher education is not so much about universities for the remainder of this year or indeed next year; it is about how they will be serving the people of Ryan, the people of the regions of this country and indeed the entire nation 10 or 20 years from now.On Friday night I had the privilege of releasing the second in a series of discussion papers - to inform what I hope will emerge as a mature and well informed debate about our choices in higher education - at the conference organised for vice-chancellors in the Blue Mountains, which was also attended by the member for Macquarie. That paper, which is entitled `Striving for quality: learning, teaching and scholarship', seeks to challenge Australians, especially those in universities, to think about the emphasis we place on teaching and also research and scholarship: what is the relationship between research and teaching in a university and what do students, their families and, in particular, employers want of those who graduate from Australian universities? Amongst the many emails and faxes I received on Friday was one from an academic in one particular university who said:Dear Dr Nelson, I have just picked up today's Australian, and this is another good call. There is little recognition by universities of the value of teaching. It is well nigh impossible to get promotion on the basis of teaching. The current situation provides an active incentive for staff to put students as the third priority behind research and administration when judging how to apportion their time.He also said:Research has been the critical factor in the assessment of candidates for promotion in this institution. I am unaware of any case in this university where teaching performance has outweighed research in the assessment of candidates for promotion.So when we are thinking about reform of Australian higher education, it is not just about funding: it is about the quality of teaching and scholarship in institutions; how they are governed and administered; how we commercialise research and ideas; how we put a sound funding platform under our regional universities; and, importantly, how we ensure growing access for students from low income families. We have 94,000 students from the lowest socioeconomic status suburbs in universities at the moment and 123,000 students from rural and regional Australia, and we want to increase the numbers.I am asked about other comments or policies. There has been a lot of consultation. I have consulted with universities, with my colleagues, of course, and also with vice-chancellors and academics. The National Tertiary Education Union put an excellent suggestion to me when I met with them recently; we are now doing a monograph on Indigenous participation in higher education. But the one organisation that has yet to make a constructive contribution is the Australian Labor Party. The only thing that we have had from the Labor Party which remotely resembles anything constructive is from the member for Jagajaga. In a media release on Friday 21 June, she said the opposition agrees that there `needs to be a greater emphasis on the quality of teaching and learning in universities'. Also the AustralianFinancialReview today reports:The federal opposition has moved closer to accepting university specialisation as a part of the government's tertiary education reforms. Altering the one-size-fits-all funding model was worth considering, said Labor's education spokeswoman Jenny Macklin.The problem the Labor Party has got is that it has one solution to all problems, and that solution is to put more public money into the problem, no matter what the nature of the problem. So, in concluding, I think there are a couple of things that need to be said. The first concerns a very important observation made by Father Malloy, who is the President of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana in the United States. Coming to Australia in the midst of this debate, he said:There are so many different demands on the resources available to the government it takes leaders with a big vision and a recognition that the world is changing to do something.That, of course, is something that the opposition - and the Leader of the Opposition as he is online to the ACTU to get his instructions for the next answer - need to consider. I think one of the most responsible remarks made by a university vice-chancellor was that of Professor Kerry Cox, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat. He said:If I white-ant everything, the capacity of Australia as a whole would be jeopardised.What he is referring to are policy termites that white-ant anything constructive and, of course, that was probably the inspiration for the term `Creanite' in Mr Keating's biography. So this is about our future. It should rise above the day-to-day partisanship which characterises the Labor Party's approach to issues, and I invite the Australian Labor Party to make a submission on the future of the country and its economic and social development through universities.</DOC>

 - I thought the shadow Treasurer might be asking a question, Mr Speaker, but I will just wait. - I have been waiting. Can I say in relation to the banking question - and I think this is the third question that has been asked - that our judgment was that when the Labor Party deregulated the financial system in 1983 it was the right thing to do, and we supported it. We supported the Labor Party in 1983 when it deregulated the financial system; we have never proposed to reregulate it. But if that bipartisan position has been broken and the Labor Party now wants to reregulate the financial system, we would be very happy to hear it. But I think you ought to put that up front; you ought to make that clear.In relation to the alternatives to banks, as I have said, there are fee-free bank accounts for low transactions offered by nearly all of the major banks, there are some foreign banks which give unlimited transactions for no fees at all, and there is the alternative of credit unions, which we have now brought up to full competition against the banking system, with access to the payment system and cheques. I mentioned the opportunity for communities to bring in the Bendigo Bank. I am told by the member for Blair that he has found the Heritage Building Society in Queensland, which offers a community banking model similar to the Bendigo Bank and has opened up at Crows Nest and elsewhere in the electorate of Blair to be a very good alternative. He would recommend it to other electorates in the area. In addition to that, one of the things that the government has been doing, of course, is setting up its transaction centres. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has facilities in relation to that which I am sure are very available. In addition to that, the government has also enhanced banking opportunities through Australia Post, allowing people to do their banking through it. So there are alternatives in Australia Post, regional transaction centres, the Heritage Building Society and the Bendigo Bank model. Our view is that it is wrong to lead people to believe that the only people that offer financial services are banks. We are all about enhancing choice, enhancing competition and ensuring that people can get the best services. We find that pretty effective. But if the Labor Party wants to go down the path of reregulating the financial system, get your leader to say it, because we would be very happy to have a debate on the issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I have seen a report in the Northern Territory News indicating that small business is confused about unfair dismissal laws. In fact, the report indicates that small businesses feel they will always lose unfair dismissal claims under current legislation and that the unfair dismissal laws are a reason for employing casuals over permanent staff.There are two members of this House that represent the interests of Northern Territorians. On the one hand you have the member for Solomon, who is a great advocate for small businesses in the Northern Territory. He has worked with small businesses and, in fact, in only his second week in parliament, he gave a speech supporting the abolition of unfair dismissal laws as they apply to small business. This is in stark contrast to the member for Lingiari. He has been in this place for 13 years and has only spoken twice in this House about unfair dismissal laws. On one of those occasions he was complaining about how he was the innocent victim of an unfair dismissal claim; on the other occasion he was complaining that the laws were not tough enough on small business. But, to be fair to the member for Lingiari, he is thinking about industrial relations. We all know he cares about industrial relations - for example, he has delivered two speeches in this place on industrial relations and on the importance of union picnic days to workers.I am asked about how the composition of the parliament may reflect a broader understanding of the issues affecting small business. When you look at the published resumes of members of parliament, the fog starts to clear, particularly in relation to the Labor Party. Over half of the coalition's members and senators have a small business background: they have either worked in small business or have been a part of small businesses. Over half of the people in the Liberal and National parties have experience in small business. - Compare that to the Labor Party where, even on the most generous assessment, one in 10 members of the Labor Party have had some experience in small business. The Senate is not far from voting on the unfair dismissal laws. In the Senate there is only one Labor senator who has ever worked in small business, and that is Senator Barney Cooney, who is retiring in a week. The Labor Party, which is going to oppose the abolition of unfair dismissal laws as they apply to small business, is going to make a decision in the Senate when not one Labor senator has ever worked in a small business or worked with a small business. That is why the Labor Party is out of touch. It has 50-50 rules, it has 60-40 rules. There is a 90-10 rule and small business is the loser, according to the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The ACCC will be given the same powers to monitor fees as it had under 13 years of Labor government. - Why not different ones, did you say? - `Why not different ones?' he interjects, Mr Speaker. - It will have the same powers that it had under 13 years of Labor Party government. Those powers include the ability to look at collusion, anticompetitive arrangements, misuse of market power or misleading or deceptive conduct. But what you did not have over the last 13 years were credit unions which could issue cheques and have access to the payment system. You did not have rural transaction centres. You did not have a Department of Transport and Regional Services that could assist in bringing community banks into regional areas. You did not have the opportunities of the Bendigo Bank or the Heritage Building Society.If you want to turn to credit cards, I earlier raised the one thing which the Labor Party never did during 13 years, something which is occurring at the moment, and that is looking at the interchange fees. Labor never did anything about interchange fees, which are the fees that banks charge each other in relation to credit cards. We have had a Reserve Bank inquiry, or really the Payments System Board inquiry, and it has made recommendations. Those recommendations are designed to break down those interchange fees. The implementation of those changes would be the biggest change in relation to credit card interchange fees that we have seen since we have had credit cards in Australia. - That is a matter which the Payments System Board is still bringing to an end in its negotiations. I think that is the way to do it. I think the way to get better banking services in Australia is by introducing new competitors, by keeping the pressure down on interest rates and by abolishing government taxes such as FID and bank account debits tax. Apart from abolishing taxes, that was the way the Labor Party saw it when it was in government. It never actually saw the prospect of abolishing taxes and never actually abolished them. - No; that is right. The Labor Party never abolished a financial tax. When this government moved to abolish financial institutions duty and bank account debits tax, the Labor Party opposed it. This is the government which abolished taxes on financial institutions. But if the Labor Party wants to argue that the financial system should be reregulated, that the government should reregulate the financial system, we would be interested to hear its proposition. After all, its constitution still commits it to the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and if that actually extends to the financial system we would be very interested to hear it. We will debate that issue. We would be very keen to debate that issue: whether or not you still believe in your constitution - we would be very happy to debate that. That is a philosophic and a policy debate. We supported you when you turned away from nationalisation and deregulated the financial system. We were a responsible opposition. If you want to go back, we will oppose you, but we would actually like to know what the proposition is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I had the pleasure of participating in a forum on ageing held in his electorate recently which he was an enthusiastic supporter of. - It was in the middle of the afternoon, Prime Minister. Carers provide an important social function for so many Australians and that is why I was able to announce on behalf of the government last week additional funding of some $8 million over two years for a carers respite package. This funding will be directed to the Commonwealth carer respite centres and also to expand respite services in the community. The federal government recognises and appreciates the significant contribution that carers make to the quality of life of frail older Australians and to the community as a whole. This package earmarks a million dollars in 2001-02 and $3 million in the financial year 2002-03 to expand respite services in the community, including in-home respite, day centre respite, host family and peer support respite, and a further $4 million has been allocated for Commonwealth respite centres across the country to enable them to directly reserve and to purchase residential respite places and short-term emergency respite places on behalf of carers. This is part of the government's commitment and ongoing response to an ageing population, a commitment which is also verified by an additional $80 million in the recent budget for carers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for his question. This government established the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to regulate aged care homes. That is something which, in 13 years in government, the Labor Party failed absolutely to do. We have also put in place a series of sanctions if aged care providers do not meet standards. Those sanctions include a reduction in the accreditation period, an appointment of a nurse administrator and a ban on homes accepting new residents until standards are met. This sends a strong message to providers that the care of residents should be their No. 1 priority.The article which the member for Grayndler refers to shows that in fact the aged care agency is doing its job and that standards will be enforced. Since January 2001, the agency has made more than 3,800 visits to aged care homes - which has resulted in only two per cent of those homes having a changed accreditation period. It is indicative that the agency is acting as a responsible regulator and that standards overall are improving. The government will and does continue to expect the agency to do its job, and the care of all residents remains the No. 1 priority.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He has always been a very strong advocate for the unemployed in his electorate. I have actually visited his electorate and met some of the Job Network members, and I know the high regard in which he is held.Everyone in the House is aware that one of the great successes of the Howard government is the Job Network and the direct and personalised services that this government has directed to those people who unfortunately do not have employment. Nearly one million people have gained employment since this government came to power. But I am pleased to inform the House that from 1 July this year there will be further enhancements to more individualised, directed services through the Australians Working Together initiatives delivered by this government.There will be 30,000 extra Job Search training places at a cost of $19 million, and 16,500 extra Work for the Dole places at a cost of $43 million, building better communities and better individuals. There will be 35,000 job seekers with community placement commitments to be made; and 60,000 job seekers in their last week of Work for the Dole will be able to have access to a passport to employment - direct assistance to make the leap from unemployment into paid employment. There will also be training credits and training accounts, at a cost of over $100 million. They are all new, important initiatives to help the unemployed. This government does not rest when it comes to helping the unemployed. We are not satisfied with 6.3 per cent; we will continue to work to drive that number down.The member for Dunkley rightly asked whether there are any alternatives. Of course, opposition should be about alternatives. Unfortunately, in this area - the area of employment and the aspirations of Australians - there is none. There is not one word being uttered either by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, in her portfolio responsibility for employment, or by the shadow minister for employment services, the member for Kingston. Not a word! It leads one to ask what could be taking up the time of the opposition so much that they do not have time to be developing policies in the areas of employment and helping those that are disadvantaged in society? You do not have to go far: it is like watching a Punch and Judy show over there. You have puppets with their heads up above the screen, presenting something to the public, but we all know where the action is. The action is below the stage, but the hand is up the shirt of Simon here, the puppet, and that is the action by the -  - The Punch and Judy show of the opposition is all fake. You see all of the anger and the indignation in this chamber, but there is not one bit of substance coming from anywhere. When the policeman Barry Jones appears on the scene and tells you that you are a rabble, all we cop is more indignation. There is no time for the opposition to spend any time on developing real policy alternatives. It is the unions that are the puppet-masters, with their hand up the shirt of the Leader of the Opposition, directing all of his deliberations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for giving me the opportunity to talk about the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It is extremely popular. We are focusing our efforts in supporting Australia's exporters on those new entrants and smaller businesses. Of course, everybody that applies under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme under a certain level will get their entitlement paid in full but, as a result of the expansion in the number of exporters involved in developing our export effort in Australia, those above a critical threshold will be restricted to the amount that is being paid so that everybody gets support, rather than chopping it off at a certain level. The overwhelming majority of applicants under the EMDG Scheme will get their full claim paid, but some who are over a particular threshold will get a percentage of their full claim paid. That is a result of the large number of claims that have come in. The government has maintained its commitment to this scheme being funded at $150 million this year. - In this financial year we have committed to this and they will be paid. All applicants will be provided with support from this scheme. I say again that the overwhelming majority of the number of applicants to this scheme will be paid their entitlement in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I know he and many of his constituents have a deep concern about the situation in the Middle East. The government welcomes the statement made by President Bush yesterday Washington time. President Bush is right in saying that the current situation offers no prospect for anyone. He is also right in calling for all those involved to fulfil their responsibilities. We have consistently supported the United States in its efforts to secure an end to the violence, to address the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people and to advance the political process in the Middle East. It is vital, despite the horrific terrorism over the past weeks and months, that we hold to the vision affirmed by the United Nations Security Council of a region where two states, Israel and Palestine, live side by side within secure and recognised borders. But an eventual peace depends on the efforts of the Palestinians and the Israelis. It has to be their peace; they have to own the peace process themselves.We concur with President Bush that the Palestinians must take strong action against terrorism, and bringing an end to the homicide bombings would do more than anything to transform the situation in the Middle East. A state will not be gained through acts of terror. As the security situation improves, Israel should be able to withdraw from Palestinian controlled territories. Settlement activity is unhelpful also to bringing peace. Israel's regional neighbours must bring pressure to bear to ensure an end to the appalling acts of murder that we have witnessed over recent times and accept, as the Saudi Arabians and some other Arab states have, that the vision affirmed by the United Nations Security Council is the final settlement that will take place in the Middle East. I made these points recently to the Iranian foreign minister, and I have spoken in similar terms to representatives of Israel's Arab neighbours. In conclusion, we welcome President Bush's statement, and we see it as an important contribution to taking the issue of peace in the Middle East forward.</DOC>

 - The question that the Leader of the Opposition asked is all very well, but what about a response to Chris Schacht, who says:Changing 60:40 to 50:50 is an improvement but we've already got 50:50 in my home state of South Australia ... - Plainly, the Leader of the Opposition has trouble transcending his past. Once a union leader, always a union leader. As Chris Schacht said:... we've already got 50:50 in my home state of South Australia, and the party there is dominated by two trade unions. - This government fully supports the Australian motor industry, and I am delighted to see that under this government's policies motor industry exports have gone up from $2 billion a year to more than $5 billion a year. This is the kind of benefit that you get from the sorts of policies that this government has pursued. The motor industry is a vital industry for Australia's future. The motor industry is absolutely at the heart of the manufacturing sector in Australia. The best way to ensure that we have a viable motor industry and that we continue to have 50,000 jobs - and more! - in the motor industry is to ensure that the industry takes full advantage of the freedoms and flexibilities that this government has made available to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his real interest in it, in particular in terms of finding the right balance between asset maximisation and looking after the very real interests of his and other constituents in Sydney in terms of amenity. I think we have found a good balance. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that the government has sold Sydney airport to Southern Cross Airports for $5.588 billion. This is the largest government trade sale in Australia's history, and the largest trade sale of any airport in the world to date. It is a very good outcome for aviation and indeed for the taxpayer as well. Southern Cross has demonstrated a clear commitment to the ongoing development of the airport as a world-class facility. Its quality should have been recognised by and evident to all Australians at the time of the Olympics when, despite some dire predictions from some quarters, the airport actually functioned extraordinarily well and confirmed its standing as one of the world's great airports. It is very important indeed, though, to note - and I know that the honourable member who asked the question will want this noted - that the change in ownership will not mean changing the existing operating arrangements at the airport. The curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and the 80 aircraft movements per hour cap will remain in force. The noise sharing policy implemented through the long-term operating plan - or LTOP, as it is known - will also continue. Access for regional airlines - and this is very important too - will continue to be guaranteed by the slot management scheme introduced by this government. The ACCC will also continue to ensure that existing prices for regional carriers at Sydney airport are maintained and that prices for those airlines do not increase in excess of the consumer price index.The ownership provisions under the Airports Act ensure that the Sydney airport must remain majority Australian owned. Other restrictions in the act limit airline ownership of Sydney airport to five per cent, as well as placing cross-ownership restrictions on investors with a stake in Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth airports. Under the sale arrangements for Sydney airport, Southern Cross will have the first right of refusal to build and operate any second major airport within 100 kilometres of the Sydney CBD, if the federal government of the day were to decide that a second airport was needed. As is known and has been announced, we will review Sydney's airport needs in 2005, but I must say - and, indeed, the people involved in the bid have indicated they certainly share our views - a second airport is not now likely to be needed for a considerable time.The government will, as has been said, apply the proceeds of the sale to reducing the $96 billion in public sector debt that we inherited from the Labor Party. In net terms, the Commonwealth's debt will be cut by $4.2 billion, which means that public debt interest payments will fall by about $250 million a year. That is another $250 million a year that gives us flexibility. We do not have to charge the taxpayers of Australia as much. We have more flexibility when it comes to providing services and providing the desirable and good things that the Australian community looks to us to provide.The honourable member asked about alternative proposals. The opposition have announced that they would spend the proceeds of the sale on infrastructure, even though during the last campaign they told us, for example, that they would cancel important infrastructure programs like the black spots program. They said they would just scrap that. They have also said that they would use the same money to reduce the government debt that they ran up when they were last in government. As well as that, during the last campaign they said that they would use the money to bail out Ansett. They do not apparently see the airport as you and I might - as a major piece of infrastructure which should be used responsibly. They see it as something akin to Norman Lindsay's magic pudding. Honourable members might recall the scene where the pudding owners are walking down the road after revealing that with this magic pudding you can cut off as many slices as you like but there is always just enough of the cake remaining. Here is a quote from it:They were all singing away at the top of their pipe, as Bill called it, when round a bend in the road they came on two low-looking persons hiding behind a tree.Here are the two low-looking persons hiding behind a tree: the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman. They are the pudding thieves. They were going to slice the pudding up so many times that it was going to cover everything that the electorate could ever conceivably have thought they would ever want, but the cake was going to remain. Unfortunately, I have to tell the opposition that there is no magic pudding. There is just the choice to determine to run the place responsibly. If they are in any way serious about infrastructure development in Australia and driving our infrastructure dollars further, what they will do is get behind our plan for AusLink, which will ensure that we get better planning and better outcomes by driving our infrastructure dollars further. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. It is well known that we have a longstanding commitment to LTOP, the long-term operating plan, put in place by this government. It clearly is an arrangement which by any test of fairness whatsoever produces a much more reasonable outcome for the residents of Sydney. There can be no question of that. The long-term operating plan has clearly led to a much more equitable -  - Mr Speaker, I get the impression that there are some on this side who would like to hear the answer, and they are signalling that they are having a bit of difficulty at the moment. There is a much more equitable distribution of noise around Sydney now. - Three out of the four noise sharing targets are not only being met but being exceeded. - In relation to the northern target of 17 per cent, we have achieved a very significant reduction, from 47 per cent of all aircraft movements when Labor was in power down to about 25 per cent today. That is in anybody's language a magnificent improvement. I simply pose the question: how many residents in Sydney would like to go back to the days of the ALP managing Sydney's noise loads? I conclude by saying this: the important point to note here is that the bidders, Southern Cross, have fully recognised and built their very attractive bid around the government's policy positions, which remain intact and in place, in terms of sharing the noise fairly and equitably in Sydney, in terms of maintaining the curfew - providing respite, in other words - and at the same time looking after the interests of regional New South Wales commuters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. As the Deputy Prime Minister has just announced, the government will receive in net proceeds from the sale of Sydney airport about $4.2 billion, after the retirement of the Airport Corporation debt. That will go to reducing the Labor Party debt - the $96 billion of Labor Party debt - which existed when this government came to office. After applying the proceeds, the coalition government will now have paid off, out of that $96 billion, $61 billion of Labor Party debt. That does not quite get us back to the situation that Australia was in before Labor ran up $80 billion worth of debt in its last five budgets, but it means we will have nearly got back to the situation that Australia was in before those last five wanton years of mismanagement under the Keating-Beazley-Crean governments.The Deputy Prime Minister has adverted to the fact that the Labor Party, back to its old tricks, has had the member for Batman already calling for some of this money to be spent on some of his pet projects, at the same time as he was calling for it to be used to reduce debt. Those of you who follow crikey.com as closely as I do will see that the member has been recycling a few things in his electorate recently including tips, in a leaflet mailed out to his electorate in Melbourne, on how to recycle Perth waste, with the phone number of the member for Swan on his leaflet. I recommend crikey.com. It includes very good reading about Delia Delegate this week and the internal machinations of the Victorian ALP. So we have the member for Batman, the recycling king - stop laughing, member for Swan - calling for some debt to be recycled and the money simultaneously to be spent.It is worth reminding the House that the government's debt repayment program is a new standard of economic management in this country. When the Labor Party engaged in privatisation, they treated the proceeds of an asset sale as recurrent revenue. Not only did they expend the total proceeds in the year of sale but at the end of it they went into financial markets and borrowed, in addition. In September 1993, for example, after selling a shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank, the Labor Party expended the whole proceeds - about $2 billion - and, after spending that, borrowed another $17 billion in Commonwealth debt. They expended the proceeds in the year of sale and ended up at the end of the year without the asset, with nothing to show for it and $17 billion worth of debt, in addition. It was the same in relation to CSL; it was the same in relation to Qantas; it was the same in relation to the Commonwealth Bank.What is the benefit that the shareholder is now getting from this government's debt reduction program? When our government came to office, we had to raise $8½ billion in taxes to pay Labor's interest bill. Because we have now retired nearly $61 billion worth of debt, our interest payments have fallen to $3.7 billion and we have an annual recurrent saving of $4.7 billion. That is $4.7 billion which we no longer have to spend on Labor debt and which can go to schools, hospitals, the environment, defence and all of the things which will build a better Australia. Retiring Labor's debt is getting rid of the mistakes of the past; spending on schools and hospitals is building the opportunities of the future. That is the difference between the coalition and Labor: one builds for the future; the other bequeaths to the future the mistakes and the legacy of a failed past.</DOC>

He should come back to where he belongs from which he was banished because he fell out with the warlords of the Australian Workers Union last year in Queensland.  -  - I was very kind to the member for Brisbane when he was the shadow minister. - The AWU's patsy here on the front bench did his best to get rid of the member for Brisbane. - I regret the fact that sometimes our employee entitlements scheme cannot pay workers as quickly as we would like. Unfortunately, our scheme relies on the cooperation of accountants and administrators. We need accountants and administrators to tell us accurately what the entitlements of these workers are before we can pay them. Whatever limitations and drawbacks our scheme has, it is 100 per cent better than all previous schemes for the simple reason that there were no previous schemes. They had 13 years to do something about this and they must have been going to do it in the 14th or 15th year. We have sorted this issue out to the benefit of Australian workers.</DOC>

 - One of the good things about being able to come in here regularly and report on our performance on the waterfront is that it just consistently gets better. When Labor left office the average container movements of our five major ports were stuck on about 16.9 movements per hour. The Labor Party, at the behest of the trade union movement, were saying, `You could not possibly expect us to ever get better than about 17 movements per hour.' Now, for six quarters in a row, we have exceeded the target we set of 25 movements an hour. Indeed, the latest Waterline shows that in the last quarter, the March quarter of this year, national crane rate productivity over our five major ports was 26.6 containers an hour. That is 10 containers an hour ahead of the Labor Party's performance and well in front of what the Labor Party led us to believe, at the behest of the unions, could ever be achieved in this country.That is of course good news. With it comes a vastly improved reputation internationally. I can confirm that from talks I had recently with shippers in Europe in relation to our port performance. They now say, `The performance is terrific. We can go to Australia safely, knowing that we will get in and out in good time.' Indeed, Waterline reported that pilotage and towage services were available within an hour of a ship's arrival or departure 99.5 per cent of the time in the March quarter and that the berth availability was 96 per cent. In fact, of the 209 ships that called at Australian ports over the three months in that quarter, only 11 of them faced significant delays.Compare that with the bad old days of the waterfront in this country when Labor - the champions of the working classes as they call themselves - were in power. Do you remember `Wran's navy'? Do you remember when the ships were lined up for miles at sea, as far as the eye could see, because of industrial disputation on the waterfront? I do not know that we have always been seen as the wharfies' best friends and I am not certain that we have always been seen as greatly enamoured of the MUA either, but a very important point to make out of good industrial relations reform is this: one of the best aspects of this reform is that waterfront workers in Australia must now be enjoying a sense of what might be called great professional satisfaction. They must feel that it is really worth while having a good reputation here and internationally and they must feel that they are doing a professional job and being well rewarded for it. Two questions arise. The first is this: I wonder how many of those waterfront workers would want to go back to doing it the way they did it under Labor? The second is this: given the exploding freight task and the number of Australian jobs that depend on our export performance, how many people would care to stand up and say that it would be in Australia's national interest or in the interests of Australian jobs to go back to running the waterfront in the way that the labour movement did?</DOC>

 - Of course the rhetoric was false. This is a budget which will protect those who rely on Commonwealth services by putting them on a sustainable financial basis. We keep hearing from the Australian Labor Party, for example, in relation to copayments on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, how in fact they are in favour of them - they introduced them; they reserve the right to increase them. If they had an ounce of decency about them they would support the measures which will make them financially sustainable.This government has announced substantial strengthening in relation to the Corporations Law. In fact, in the most recent budget it announced increases in funding to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Those members of the House that follow these things carefully will see that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission have recently taken action against one of the people involved in FAI and HIH, with a very severe penalty imposed. I will not say any more about that because it is on appeal. I do not think it would be proper for me to say anything more. But I pay tribute to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for the way in which they have taken court proceedings. Without prejudicing in any way the ultimate outcome of those court proceedings, I pay credit to the way in which they took them - and they were brought very quickly. With additional funding, we believe that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will be able to continue their important work.In relation to directors' bonuses, we announced that changes to the law would obviously be prospective from the time at which they come into effect, so those matters that have previously occurred would be governed by the law as it stood at the time and as it was enacted by the Labor Party. I do not think that even the Labor Party would say that we should have retrospectively amended Labor law in relation to those particular incidents. The most that we could do was announce that we would do it prospectively. We have engaged in extensive consultation, we have framed procedures, and we intend to continue with it. You named a particular company -  - The new law will not apply to that company because it will be prospective, but the existing law, which gives the power to liquidate or reach back in relation to trading while insolvent or with an undue preference, will be available to the liquidator concerned. If those circumstances occur, the liquidator will be able to take proceedings. The enhancements of that, which have been discussed and flagged by this government, will be introduced by this government and they will be prospective. </DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I can tell the House that this government entirely shares the member for Herbert's concern to protect the workers of Townsville from a $500-a-year union tax. Right around Australia, workers are now threatened with a form of industrial conscription by union leaders who have taken the view that, if we cannot persuade people to pay, we will make them pay. First out of the blocks is none other than Dean Mighell, the head of the Electrical Trades Union, the Victorian Trades Hall boss and the convenor of the Craig Johnson legal aid fund, who said this morning that every non-union worker at Qantas should be made to pay $500 a year in union taxes, even though the union's most recent service to Qantas was threatening to ground the airline when it was at its most vulnerable after September 11. What Dean Mighell and his colleagues want is to force workers to pay a $500-a-year tax to unions which have sought to destroy their jobs. The editorial in the Australian yesterday said about members opposite and their union cohorts:They've trawled out the line that it's un-Australian for non-unionists to take a 'free ride'. That sounds like the blackmail being exposed by the royal commission into the building industry. Hey, maybe money pinched from the non-unionists could be used to pay affiliation fees to the Labor Party and get the union bosses a seat in the Senate so they can become factional warlords.The Electrical Trades Union has paid a half a million dollars to the Labor Party over the last six years. If that union can force 2,000 Qantas employees to pay these taxes, it could double its donation in a single hit. These compulsory union levies are looking increasingly like a giant extortion racket run by the industrial arm of the unions to benefit the political arm of the unions. They look like they are designed to pour rivers of gold into the coffers of the ALP in a way that would make the Centenary House scam look like petty cash.Members opposite who support these union fees want workers of Australia to pay a $500-a-year union tax, not for the country's benefit but for their own political benefit. Five hundred dollars would pay the average family's doctor's bills for a year, it would pay the average family's car insurance fees for a year and it would cover the average family's vegetable bills for a year. We had Sharan Burrow complaining not long ago that the average worker cannot afford to go out for a meal. Five hundred dollars would buy the average family a night out at Pizza Hut every three weeks for a year. When it comes to leaving money in the pockets of the average worker or channelling it into the union funds, members opposite choose the unions every time. A big question for members opposite is: whose side are they on? Are they on the side of the ordinary Australian worker, the decent Australian battler, or are they on the side of the union heavies? This government is going to give them a chance to demonstrate their true colours. This government is going to have the compulsory union fees bill debated and voted upon in the Senate this week. That will be a chance for members opposite to show where they stand. This government supports the workers of this country. Sadly, the once great Labor Party is now completely in the pocket of unrepresentative and often corrupt union officials.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gellibrand for her question, and I would encourage more questions. This is the second that we have had on child care. The member for Gellibrand has outlined some issues on which I am very happy to inform her and the Australian Labor Party. - With regard to the child-care assistance recall that she is talking about - again, to inform the House - the child-care benefit came into being two years ago and there were previously two payment forms: child-care assistance and child-care rebate. After the introduction of the child-care benefit, we continued to pay services in advance to ensure that those services were viable. This is a normal advance and acquittal process. - We did. She is saying `two years'. We have given them two years to repay this debt. We have been more than generous in giving assistance, particularly to community based care centres so that they can repay money which they are not entitled to. I have to say that the vast majority of child-care centres are very grateful that the coalition government introduced child-care benefit, because their services are viable, there are more children than ever before using Commonwealth funded child care and it is cheaper. There is a responsibility, on those services that you referred to, to repay money that they have owed the Commonwealth now for over two years. - I notice the Leader of the Opposition jumps in about places. There are more places now in child care than there have ever been before - well over 710,000 places. Even in the area of outside school hours care, which you are showing some concern for - I welcome constructive comments from the opposition, because we get very few in the area of children or child care - under this government the number of places has gone up 221 per cent. There were 71,000 places in outside school hours care; there are now 221,000. It has gone up like a rocket, because this side of the House is all about providing fairness when it comes to families, giving them a choice between family and work. There are some issues that I would like you to help me with in outside school hours care. The first is that you can go and knock on the door of all your Labor state colleagues -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I know you have a keen interest in child care as well, because of the good policies of the government. I know you are dealing -  - I know, Mr Speaker, you are dealing with a lot of kids on that side of the House. But as far as outside school hours care goes, I think there is an opportunity now for all the state Labor ministers to inform their constituency base about getting some regulation, which I think is very important within outside school hours care. We do have a situation where we can reallocate places that are surplus. - I know the Speaker is listening to this question. There is an opportunity to reallocate places within outside school hours care. But the record that we have on child care is outstanding - absolutely outstanding - and we are proud of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I recognise the keen interest she has taken in strong borders for Australia. I know that reflects very much the views of the good people of McPherson, an electorate that we are all pretty familiar with. The honourable member would know that secondary movement is the onward movement of asylum seekers from the country of first asylum. This is increasingly an issue of very real concern to the international community. Not surprisingly, Australia is at the forefront of international efforts to address this issue, as a failure to address the question of secondary movements very substantially undermines the effectiveness of the international protection system.The Bali people-smuggling conference held at the end of February, which was cochaired by Indonesia and Australia, galvanised regional support to combat people-smuggling, including addressing the issue of secondary movements in a significant way. I note that New Zealand is now coordinating one of the two expert working groups established in Bali to explore how this specific problem can be addressed more effectively. I am pleased to note that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is now increasingly addressing the issue of secondary movements. I met last week with the regional director of the UNHCR. Secondary movement was one of the issues we discussed, and I congratulated him on the higher profile this issue is taking in UNHCR. I know the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs shares that view as well.All of this is an increasing acknowledgment that the issue of secondary movement must be addressed. The vast majority of unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia are not directly fleeing persecution. In most cases, they have bypassed the opportunity to seek protection in countries they transited on the way to Australia, or have not been prepared to await the outcome of regular migration processes. As we have so often said in this House, Australia must send an unambiguous message to people smugglers that they cannot subvert our laws and our borders. That is something that Australia can get right, and it does not have to rely on the action of others.The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative approaches, and of course there is the approach the Labor Party has been taking to this whole issue, which is increasingly becoming obscured by deep divisions within the party. I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to pedal in all directions to try to cover up the divisions that exist in the Labor Party, where there are stresses between the bourgeois left who grace the benches of federal parliament and the ordinary people -   - in the community who traditionally have voted Labor. I certainly do not vote Labor - you are right. But the parliamentary level of the Labor Party is becoming increasingly disconnected from the traditional voters of the Labor Party. After the election, which was seven months ago, the Labor Party said that it would produce a new policy on people-smuggling and border control. On 12 February the Leader of the Opposition said, `Let's get on with it,' enthusiastically advocating the new policy. The next day - having reflected for 24 hours - he said, `We need time.' And on 26 May - three or so months later - the Leader of the Opposition said, `Oh, well, we are taking submissions.' On 29 May he said, `We are having discussions and we'll be announcing our position at the appropriate time.' Then on 6 June he said there was a significant review which was `going to take place'. Submissions are already coming in for the Labor Party - submissions from the New South Wales Labor Party, submissions from the Queensland Labor Party and submission from the Western Australian Labor Party - and I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has had discussions with people like the member for Fremantle, the member for Denison and the member for Sydney.I notice with interest that today the member for Lowe put a question on notice to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs - a minister with a high profile today - calling for the replacement of mandatory detention for asylum seekers with community based alternatives. The fact is that the Labor Party is saying that it is strong on border protection, but it actually has only one policy, and that is for our regional neighbours to do more and for Australia to do nothing. The Labor Party is abrogating its responsibilities as a significant political party in this country. It is losing contact with the Australian people at the federal level, day in and day out. That is because on this issue the Labor Party is deeply and hopelessly divided.</DOC>

 - All I can say is that a question like that is the question of a deeply desperate leader in a desperate situation who is losing support day by day within his own party, having first lost it from the community. Of course money paid by Australia to Nauru is not being used for terrorism. What an utterly absurd and outrageous proposition. That is what I mean by a desperate leader: a man who is so baked he would even make an allegation as obviously untrue as that. It must be one of the most absurd propositions I have ever heard in this parliament. Actually, the government is not paying $100 million to the government of Nauru. The Australian government has put in place support for the establishment of facilities in Nauru, and obviously there is a cost associated with that. We have made it clear on many occasions that we have to provide support for Nauru in order for Nauru to be able to buy fuel, to be able to have access to essential health services and education, and the total cost over two years -  - articulated very clearly in the memorandum of understanding that I signed with President Harris and also in the agreement signed by Peter Reith at the end of last year, is around $26 million.  - To suggest that somehow these projects would be used to promote terrorism -  - is one of the most absurd propositions I think I have ever heard. - In relation to the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, I can confirm that it has maintained countermeasures against Nauru following the task force review of Nauru's anti-money laundering regime. Countermeasures have been maintained because Nauru has not fully addressed key outstanding concerns of members with respect to Nauru's anti money laundering laws. Australia has provided considerable assistance to Nauru to bring Nauru's anti money laundering measures up to standard, and we do remain committed to working with Nauru to help them address the outstanding issues. But there are certain measures that Nauru has to take on its own, such as dealing with problems raised by the offshore banking sector. The fact is, though, that Nauru is a small country of 10,000 people. The government there is doing its best to address this complex issue. Our government is certainly providing technical assistance to help Nauru address the issues and we hope that as time goes on it will be possible for Nauru to satisfy the Financial Action Task Force.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. Last Friday I visited the Codrington wind farm in his electorate, not far from Portland. This is a project that commenced a year ago, encouraged by the government's Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, and it now generates enough electricity for around 14,000 homes. It has great support from the local community, and it is also something of a tourist attraction. In terms of greenhouse benefits, the energy supplied by the Codrington wind farm is a saving of some 88,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year when compared with coal generation.This project is one of many investments which are now being encouraged by the fact that the government has established a mandatory renewable energy target. This target requires energy retailers and wholesale buyers to contribute an additional 9½ thousand gigawatt hours from renewable sources per year by 2010. In practical terms, that is enough electricity to power four million households; it is enough to power Sydney. Thanks to the Howard government's mandatory renewable energy target, there has been a great interest in a whole variety of projects to generate electricity from renewable sources. We have already accredited schemes to produce energy from the more widely known hydro, solar and wind sources. We have also accredited more novel renewable sources harnessing power from our waste, like landfill gas, sewage gas, black liquor and wood waste cofiring, and municipal solid waste. We are now getting proposals for even more innovative projects, such as projects involving biofuels and geothermal and tidal power.The proposals that are coming forward now are really exciting. They will have to prove up economically, of course, and not all of them will prove up economically. However, our renewable energy target is also providing spin-off benefits for many communities and industries now supplying those who are generating renewable energy. For example, the manufacture of wind turbines and turbine tower manufacturing are going to provide new economic activity and new jobs in many communities around Australia, particularly in the member for Wannon's electorate. The benefits to our environment are going to come from reduced greenhouse gases, and these developments are taking place alongside new technologies to make our coal and fossil fuels cleaner for the international market. I am asked whether I am aware of any alternative policies. In relation to other renewable energy policies, the only renewable energy within the Labor Party that I am aware of is the resurgent energy that produces this constant factional friction within the party and that renews itself again and again. It is a pity that it does not qualify for tradeable renewable certificates because then they would have the opportunity to make a motser and they would not have to rely on union dues. We well know that who pays the piper calls the tune. The truth is this: the Labor Party have no renewable energy policy. Until they pull the plug on their union bosses, they will have no renewable policy energy.</DOC>

 - I have explained already that the simple proposition here is that the Australian government assisted Nauru with its anti money laundering legislation: we provided significant assistance there. I am not aware of the details in relation to Senator Ellison's discussions with the OECD. - What a brilliant point you have come up with! I was not actually at every single meeting every government minister has ever had with the OECD. Without knowing precisely what Senator Ellison said at any OECD meeting, I can say this to you: I have no doubt that Senator Ellison would have drawn the OECD's attention to the work that the Australian government had done to assist Nauru in this respect. I would have thought, contrary to the rather puerile imputations in the Labor Party's questions, that the government should be congratulated for assisting Nauru to address these issues, rather than leaving these issues unaddressed. Is that the proposition from the Labor Party: that we should have done absolutely nothing about assisting Nauru to counter this problem of money laundering through their offshore banking system? - I would have thought it was a no-brainer: it is obvious we should have been assisting, it is obvious we were assisting and it is right for us to draw that to the attention of the OECD.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie and indeed all my Queensland colleagues for the great commitment to and interest that they have in Queensland government state schools, in particular the Norris Road State School, which we discussed last week after question time. Just to recap, the story so far is that the Commonwealth government this year increased its funding to Queensland government state schools by 5.8 per cent. On the day after the Commonwealth budget, the Queensland state Minister for Education, in criticising a 5.8 per cent increase committed to their state government schools by the Howard government - in fact, she thought it was a 6.2 per cent increase - dismissed it and said it was no good. So I invited honourable members last week to ask themselves what figure above 6.2 per cent might increase it in their own -   - So the Commonwealth increased its funding to Queensland government state schools, including the Norris Road State School, by 5.8 per cent. When the Queensland government delivered its budget for its schools, it increased its funding to its state government schools by three per cent. - That is right. A paltry three per cent. - The Treasurer wants to know, `How do they do that?' and I am getting to that. The point is that, if the Queensland government had increased its funding to its state government schools by 5.8 per cent, there would have been another $102 million available for Queensland students.I am asked whether there had been any other comments or criticisms of this policy. I was travelling down to Canberra on Sunday night and I was reading the Sunday Mail from Queensland. I got to page 46 and I had to do a double take: there was a beautiful photograph of a very disappointed young primary school student, and above the photograph was a headline that said, `She deserves better'. Below the photograph it said, `Beattie government fails to deliver again'. So I read on:The Beattie government has let down state school students again.I turned to my staff member and said, `Are we running advertisements in Queensland papers pointing out the truth in relation to Queensland state schools?' - And he said, `No, Minister, we're not running advertisements in Queensland newspapers.' So I read on:Premier Peter Beattie's budget failed to give our children the priority they deserve.It went on:State school funding has now been stagnant in real terms for three years.I then stopped and said to my staff member: `Could this be - no, it couldn't be - the member for Jagajaga pointing out that the Queensland Labor government has delivered only a paltry three per cent increase in funding to its government schools?' Again, my staff member said, `No, Minister, no; it is not the member for Jagajaga.' I read on:This is despite earlier positive government announcements and Premier Beattie's supposed commitment to the `Smart State'. Tell the Beattie government to give our children the highest priority.I thought, `Who could be the source of this advertisement? It must have cost a lot of money.' Then at the very bottom I read:Authorised by John Battams, General Secretary, Queensland Teachers' Union. Extraordinary! The Queensland Teachers Union supported this with a media release entitled, `State Government school Budget flaws exposed'. It reads:The Beattie Government's state school Budget 'fails miserably' when subject to close inspection, the Queensland Teachers' Union said today. It is to that very close inspection that I, as the minister, this government and my department will be subjecting every single state and territory education budget. The union went on to say:The Budget has let down the 475,000 students who attend state schools in Queensland. Premier Peter Beattie is continuing the same tired old pattern of talking boldly about education but failing miserably to deliver fair funding.Queensland: paltry one day, miserable the next! That $102 million for state government schools in Queensland would have funded another 14 primary schools, it would have funded seven high schools and it would have given a laptop computer to every student in Queensland state schools, plus a laptop to their teachers.As I reminded the House yesterday, the Vice-Chancellor of Ballarat University, Professor Kerry Cox, said in relation to education that, `If I white-ant every policy, I may not be serving and upholding the national interest'. Queenslanders are very much aware of fire ants; it seems now that they have a new pestilence, and that is policy white ants - the Creanites of the Labor Party who undermine national policy! If the Creanites, led by the member for Jagajaga, want to send a message to the Queensland government, it should be this: in relation to state government school funding, keep up with the Commonwealth. This government will be carefully scrutinising every single state and territory budget. After four state budgets, they are $400 million behind the Commonwealth's commitment to state government schools.</DOC>

 - The ethanol industry in Australia is very much in its fledgling stages but has great potential for many farmers, including those in the seat of Wakefield, the seat of Groom, and other seats held by the many members of the coalition in regional Australia. This government is committed to further development of the ethanol industry, and the Commonwealth will undertake a $5 million two-year study on the market barriers to greater use of biofuels for transport. The study will develop a strategy to increase biofuels production by some 350 million litres per annum by 2010. - I thought I was, Mr Speaker. - The reality is that this government is pursuing a strategy and part of that strategy will be vehicle testing and technical assessment of the E20 ethanol blend. The ethanol industry in Australia has the potential to provide Australia with alternative sources of fuel. I am always happy to speak with representatives of that industry; in fact, I have on a number of occasions already, both with representatives from within my own electorate of Groom and also with representatives from right across Australia. It is an industry which has some potential which we are keen to explore. </DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. I recognise the enormous importance of the food industry to her electorate and indeed to many people in rural and regional Australia. Last week the first meeting was held of the new National Food Industry Council, which will guide the implementation of the coalition government's $102.4 million food industry strategy. This will help establish for Australia a modern and progressive food processing sector. I believe that is absolutely essential for the future prosperity of our food production industry and to make sure that Australia retains a market share in the fast-growing food processing sector. The reality is that trade in processed food is growing at twice the rate of trade in raw materials and yet Australia's share of that market is actually declining. So I think it is very important that we put in place the necessary strategies to make sure that Australia deals with the issues of trade liberalisation, e-commerce, the emergence of global supply chains, changing consumer demands and important issues like food safety and the environmental requirements that make an impact on the food processing sectors.I think it is essential that instead of exporting our farm products as raw materials we do more to process them in this country. The strategy that the Prime Minister and others have led in developing an approach to an innovative and competitive food processing sector has certainly got off to an excellent start. I would have thought that there would be some degree of bipartisanship in support of the idea of processing more of our food in Australia and having these jobs created in this country rather than exporting the jobs overseas. But sadly, members opposite, the opposition, have nothing by way of a policy to support the food processing sector. They did have a noodle nation policy, but I do not think that had much to do with food. And yet there are so many things that the Labor Party could actually do to help build a constructive food processing sector. As they are 60 per cent owned by the trade union movement, it is important for them to recognise that one of the most important barriers - and this was an issue the member raised in her question - to developing a competitive food processing sector is to have one which has competitive industrial relations. We are sick and tired in this country of having factories closed down because unions will not agree to reasonable working conditions and so these jobs are exported overseas.The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations mentioned last week the fact that the unions have been rowing now for well over a year about the proposed new pasta and cheese manufacturing facility at Melton. As a result, after a year of industrial dispute to try and get this factory built, the proponents are now talking about taking these 170 jobs to New Zealand. If that is not bad enough, we had the Swiss company Barry Callebaut recently decide to build their new plant in Singapore rather than Victoria. Their reason? Victoria's appalling record in industrial relations. Nestle have announced the closure of their plant at Maryborough - and I would have thought the honourable member for Bendigo would be very concerned about that - again because of industrial relations problems. They are again facing enormous difficulties in their new plant in Melbourne because of the barrage of industrial disputes. What about Unilever? They moved their tea blending and packaging from Victoria to Indonesia. Heinz Wattie closed Dandenong and moved to New Zealand, again because of the annual Victorian tomato strike which was always causing problems for that industry. Arnotts moved out of Victoria. This is the kind of record that Labor has in dealing with the food processing sector. They are far more interested in closing factories than endeavouring to work constructively towards developing the sorts of practices that will keep these jobs in Australia and not export them to Singapore, New Zealand or other countries. I call on members opposite, while they are still controlled by the trade union movement, to do something about developing a constructive approach towards the food processing sector. Have these jobs created in Australia; do not export them around the world. </DOC>

 - I am not aware of the statement alleged by the Leader of the Opposition to have been made by the officer of the Asia-Pacific regional group of the Financial Action Task Force. I will check to see whether the Leader of the Opposition is correct. But I can say about Nauru that it has been the subject of considerable attention by the Asia-Pacific regional group and by the Financial Action Task Force. As recently as early June, it was the subject of discussion at the Asia-Pacific regional group and, as recently as last week, it was the subject of discussion at a full meeting of the Financial Action Task Force. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made absolutely plain, Australia has been assisting Nauru to bring its legislation and structures into place. As he said, Nauru is a small country; it does not have extensive and sophisticated mechanisms in place. Australia has been assisting Nauru and will continue to assist. It is not plausible to accuse the Howard government of being soft on terrorism or soft on crime. We are working with Nauru to get it right.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can tell him that the Australian Industry Group survey of Australian manufacturing for the June quarter was released this morning. It showed that manufacturing production in this quarter is at an eight-year high. On the basis of the survey results, AIG expects manufacturing to grow strongly on a national account basis. The strongest influence on production in the June quarter was increased demand, with stronger new orders improving exports. The net balance of 31 per cent reporting stronger sales in the June quarter is the highest result recorded by the survey. A net balance of 28 per cent of firms reported stronger new orders in the June quarter. Interestingly - and I am sure both sides of the House will welcome this news - employment and overtime both increased in the June quarter, suggesting continued strength in the labour market. - My goodness, the member for Fremantle is still with us! A net balance of eight per cent of firms reported rising employment in the June quarter, and this rate is expected to continue into the September quarter. That is good news for the manufacturing industry. The manufacturing industry is reporting increased demand, demand for labour and increased overtime and production, and that is consistent with a strongly growing economy. The Economist magazine forecasts Australia to be the strongest growing economy in 2002 and 2003, with a low inflation regime, low interest rates and a new taxation system, which has taken all taxes off exports. It does not take much of a memory to remember two years ago, when the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition used to come to the dispatch box day after day, telling us that if the GST did not give us interest rate rises it would give us interest rate falls, and if it did not give us an overheating economy it would give us a recession, and whatever else was going to come down upon us in plague and pestilence upon the land. But the good news is that Australia has come through that period. Our economy is strong, we have survived the US downturn, and manufacturing is looking optimistic. Economic management is important for giving people jobs, and that is what the coalition government remains committed to.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question, and I know of her very considerable interest in these matters. She, along with many other members on this side of the House, has a desire to know what has been happening in relation to the processing of people who have arrived without lawful authority in Australia and a desire to know that that processing is proceeding quickly and expeditiously. As at 21 June, departmental records show that there are only 11 people held in detention who are awaiting a primary decision. That is in comparison to 1,559 in August 2001. As at 21 June, we have some 685 unauthorised boat arrivals still in detention. One might ask: if there are only 11 who are awaiting a primary decision, on what basis are the balance of them held? The basis is quite clear. First, there have been findings that they are not refugees. Notwithstanding the mantra that you hear quite frequently that we should free the refugees, there are no refugees held in detention in Australia. Of those unauthorised boat arrivals that we are holding, only 11 are awaiting a primary decision, and in those cases security and criminal record checks are primarily the reasons that those 11 people have not received decisions. Of the 685 detainees, 340 are awaiting removal from Australia. That is just short of half of the total number of unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia. The remainder are pursuing appeals in one form or another and, of those, 230 are pursuing judicial review.We have had a very significant decrease in the number of people awaiting primary decisions. The reason can be put down to the effectiveness of government policy in curtailing unauthorised boat arrivals. The strategies are multifaceted. They involve us engaging countries at source. They involve transit, and they involve both multilateral and bilateral discussions with other countries that receive people. They involve law enforcement, including the arrest of known smugglers. They include an examination of our own legal framework here in Australia, of the way in which we deal with claims and of our endeavour to ensure that those issues are dealt with as quickly as possible. Efforts to obtain return agreements are also part of the strategy in which we are involved. We are working cooperatively with international agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration, as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I am sure all honourable members understand the importance of having strong domestic law to be able to deal with these issues, and that includes the ongoing provision of mandatory detention for people who arrive without lawful authority and who are required to be removed.In relation to those people who are pursuing judicial review, one interesting statistic that I noted about people who escaped from Woomera over the Easter period was that none of them have presented subsequently, even though eight of them had matters before the courts. One might have expected that, if they were genuinely about pursuing justice for themselves, they would have come forward and arranged to ensure that the litigation which they were involved in was pursued, and pursued expeditiously.Of course, we also have the return of unauthorised boat arrivals, where possible. We saw four vessels returned to Indonesia as part of Operation Relex, which had a very important impact. We have had the excisions of Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands and Ashmore Reef, which has ensured that those who did make it to Australia or to Australian waters by sabotaging vessels and the like were able to be processed offshore, with the gains that we have been able to obtain through that processing being more efficacious. It is disappointing to me that efforts to ensure the excision of other areas where we suspect that people might land and seek to access our migration zone were not allowed to proceed. What did the opposition have to say when that matter was dealt with in the Senate? They came to us and said, `This issue has to be dealt with quickly; it needs to be resolved.' They accused the government of dragging their feet, of lacking confidence in their own proposed solution and of not bringing the measures on for debate. What do we find in relation to these matters where they accuse us of delay? Let me say that there was no delay. We tabled the regulations and enabled debate to proceed, as we would be required to do under the forms of the parliament in any event -  - Yes, 15 days. Let me just make the point in relation to these matters that, when we have other legislation, what do we see the opposition seeking to do? To delay and to frustrate. What they have sought to do in the Senate when they have been calling for these matters to be dealt with expeditiously is to send them off to a Senate committee so that we might see them in the `never-never dealt with'. Quite clearly, the opposition are about denying the parliament the opportunity to pass legislation that will reinforce the measures that we have sought to implement so as to have a comprehensive range of measures in place and operating. When given the opportunity to consider these matters a second time, the opposition are saying, `We are determined not to cooperate; we are determined to frustrate.'   - The opposition leader says, `Where is the boat?' His worst fear would be to see a boat arrive. And there we have it. Clearly, the opposition is about denying measures which will ensure that we are able to maintain a successful approach in dealing with these issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do remember making those remarks. As a matter of fact, it was just prior to the cabinet deciding that, quite independently of the sale of Sydney airport, we could go ahead with Roads to Recovery. I do not actually regard that as being rolled. Indeed, the Western Sydney Orbital was also announced shortly after that. It is being built in full cooperation - I must say, much to my surprise - with the New South Wales Minister for Transport. When it comes to infrastructure, there are a number of areas where I think it ought to be remembered that the government are very active, and all of the projects have been made much more readily achievable through the process of restoring the nation's books. That would include what we have been able to do in perhaps the most important bit of infrastructure of all for country people - telecommunications. Real resources are going into telecommunications. In terms of our natural environment, there is the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan. Billions of dollars are going into securing the most basic infrastructure of all for the nation. In relation to Speedrail and the idea of linking our eastern cities by a high-speed passenger train network, it became obvious after some serious preliminary work that the cost to the taxpayer would be so enormous that no future government would be likely to contemplate it, and it was not right to perpetuate a false hope. I think the member for Batman's question simply highlights the fact that we have been able to deliver major infrastructure. When it comes to own goals, I do not profess for a moment to be able to match the member for Batman, who, as alluded to by the Treasurer yesterday, recently put out a leaflet in his own electorate called `Martin Ferguson's green guide'. It was full of useful recycling hints. Of course, it had been recycled itself from the leaflets of some of his comrades in Western Australia. It told the good burghers and others of Batman that they could save the environment while in transit. It also said: Many Perth people have developed a very dangerous addiction to fossil fuel.No doubt the good people of Batman have not developed an addiction to fossil fuel. It told the residents of Batman:The City of Perth offers substantial parking discounts to people who car pool.Then under the heading of `Saving Water' it talks about how:Perth has doubled its population in the last 20 years ...And:In Western Australia we have had an extensive media campaign ...We are going on about the -  - Mr Speaker, I conclude by saying that the member for Batman's number is on the inside of the cover, but it says inside `Call my office' on a different number. And when we called that number, as crikey.com will tell you -  - the member for Swan's office comes on the line.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. I remind him that in July 2000 the coalition government introduced the First Home Owners Scheme, which gave eligible home buyers a grant of $7,000 towards their first home. On 9 March 2001 the government announced an additional $7,000, taking the maximum up to $14,000 for first home buyers purchasing a new home. That additional scheme is coming to an end at the end of this month, 30 June, but the original grant of $7,000 continues.I can inform the House that a total of 334,000 Australians have received the first home owners grant. Of those, 45,000 received the full grant of $14,000. This has enabled many Australians for the first time in their lives to buy a home and to have a stake in their own residence. For example - and the honourable member for Parkes probably saw the story - the Sydney Morning Herald reported on 24 June that Jacqui Hemsley of Broken Hill bought a three-bedroom house for $7,000 with the $7,000 grant. The whole of the purchase price of the house in Broken Hill was paid by the government's First Home Owners Scheme. The Sydney Morning Herald reported on 4 March 2002 that every house in Incense Place, Casula in Sydney had been funded by the First Home Owners Scheme. The Sanchez family moved into No.19, and Ben Sanchez said:We would not have been able to do this without the grant ... It has just helped us so much.And that is what a coalition government is about: helping the people of Casula. But the Weekend Australian on 15 June reported probably the best story of the First Home Owners Scheme. It reported on Lloyd Davis, 84 years of age, in Wickepin in the electorate of O'Connor. Lloyd Davis bought his first home at 84. The Weekend Australian reported: For most of his 84 years, Lloyd Davis has been a rolling stone. A teenage runaway, he has been a swagman, a soldier in World War II and a demolition contractor around West Australia's remote north. He never had time or inclination to buy his own home.That is, until now.Mr Lloyd Davis, who is 84 years old, was quoted:`I always managed to pay my way, but there was just never the right time to buy a house,' he said yesterday. `Now I'm a happy vegemite.'Coalition government is about helping the people of Casula, Broken Hill and Wickepen. This is a government which gets on with the business of helping people get into their own homes and have a stake in the future of Australia.</DOC>

A careful reading of Senator Alston's transcript - I did not hear it - makes it perfectly plain that he was referring to the fact that the time is approaching when we will need to benchmark the achievements of our reforms, as recommended by Besley in his identification of the shortfalls in service levels in country areas. The point at which we move to assess that program and the process of reforms is drawing closer. But that is an entirely separate issue to the other broader issue that you raise of future sales. You are just misrepresenting the situation: nothing has changed in the government's position at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. As every member of this House knows, sometimes some pretty hard things are said in the course of political debate. Some of those things are fair and some of those things are unfair. When anyone goes over the top, as sometimes happens, we should have the ordinary human decency to retract and apologise. As the House doubtless knows, the member for Werriwa has made a particularly vulgar statement about the Prime Minister. Even those who might agree with the member for Werriwa's general position ought to accept that the language of the gutter should have no place at all in Australia's public discourse. But the member for Werriwa went further than that. - I have been asked about the government's commitment to maintaining the standards of public life. The member for Werriwa went further than that. He said to the Bulletin, published earlier today: I'm a hater. Part of the tribalness of politics is to really dislike the other side with intensity. And the more I see of them the more I hate them. - Let me just say that Australians often disagree with each other, we argue with each other and sometimes we even dislike each other, but we do not hate each other. The elevation of hatred to a principle of political life is the kind of thing that happens in other countries and is responsible for the tragedies that we see daily, alas, in the Middle East. One of the great strengths of Australian public life is the ability of members of this parliament to engage in furious debate but still to respect each other's fundamental values and fundamental motives. I respectfully put it to the member for Werriwa that his comments do not reflect the true standards of Australian public life and they do not respect his own true standards. I respectfully put it to the member for Werriwa that he is better than that and that he would help himself and his leader if he apologised and retracted his statements to the Bulletin magazine.</DOC>

 - I would have to check the historical record. -  - Given the energetic nature of the Australian character, if I could put it that way, I would be surprised, if you were to trawl right back through the record, if you might not find the odd example - and you are talking here of recorded examples, let alone unrecorded examples - of where people may have shaped up. But let me simply say this: I do not intend to dignify the remarks of the member for Werriwa with any kind of response myself.  - I would simply say that I have every confidence in the integrity, the ability, the decency and the good character of the Leader of the House. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. Obviously, all members of the government are very interested in the contribution that the farm sector makes to our economy, particularly the wellbeing of our economy, and arguably there has never been an Australian government that has done more for the Australian farm community, particularly on the international scene. To start with, the policies of our government have created one of the most efficient and competitive domestic economic environments for our Australian farm community to export from. We have done that by creating a stable environment for low interest rates as well as - as you would well know in your constituency, Mr Speaker - removing $3½ billion worth of taxes that were maintained over the years by Labor governments on Australia's exports. That has seen our overall export effort grow from $99 billion in 1996 to in excess of $154 billion today. As a part of that, Australian farm exports have continued to grow under our government: agricultural exports have grown from $22.65 billion in 1996 to more than $32.3 billion in 2001. That is an increase of 43 per cent in six years. As I say, we have created a much more efficient and competitive environment economically in Australia from which they can export.One of the most important things we have achieved recently has been the launching of the next round of trade negotiations in the WTO, something that was pursued for a number of years and that we failed to achieve in Seattle but did achieve in Doha. This will provide us with the opportunity to seriously address the distortions in the global trade in agricultural products in terms of the levels of domestic support and the distortions that exist that allow countries like the United States of America to apply excessively high levels of domestic support, such as those that have been mandated through the farm bill.If we can focus on that for a minute, let us not forget - and I remind the House - that the Australian Labor Party in government was the party that signed off or legitimised the levels of that support in the Uruguay Round. The Labor Party in government signed off and legitimised the United States being able to spend then $23 billion per annum, the Australian Labor Party legitimised Japan being able to spend $40 billion, the Australian Labor Party legitimised the European Union being able to spend $76 billion - and at the same time was able to negotiate levels of support for Australian agriculture of only $300 million.So what have we been doing? We have aggressively pursued a trade policy agenda, on behalf of Australia's farm community, in a number of different ways, and that is the fundamental area in which we are going to address those distortions. We expressed quite clearly our extreme dissatisfaction at the Bush administration's endorsement of the farm bill. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and I all expressed our extreme concern at the farm bill and at what it would do as far as Australian agriculture was concerned. The Prime Minister, in his address to the Congress when he was recently in Washington, made that point very clear - crystal clear. We have taken that argument up to our American colleagues. Australia has a reputation as being an aggressive advocate of trade liberalisation for agriculture. We have the largest or strongest reputation for that; we always have. We continue to pursue that now, and we always will. We will pursue it in those ways whereby we can achieve results and have achieved results, much more than was the case when the Australian Labor Party was in office.While I am on my feet, could I refer to another issue with regard to exports and the United States, and that is the issue of steel tariffs. I can inform the House that last week the Bush administration put Australia's exclusion request for cold-rolled steel out for public consultation. Cold-rolled steel represents the bulk of the remaining 15 per cent of steel. I can inform the House that the Bush administration is seriously considering our exclusion request. I can also inform the House that in the last 24 hours a further exclusion has been granted to an Australian-produced steel product - galvanised, cold-rolled steel channels. That is clear evidence that you get results not by going to Washington lecturing people but by going to Washington with a balanced argument in pursuit of your objectives, of the policy we are running. That is being done by ministers of this government and it is being done by the Prime Minister leading this government and leading Australia. Any suggestion that this government is not absolutely aggressive in pursuit of the interests of Australia's trade agenda, and particularly agricultural reform, is absolutely baseless. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The current year that is being referred to with the funding of Export Market Development Grants Scheme applications has been an astoundingly successful year for Australian exporters. We are increasing the number of exporters and we are increasing the level of exports out of Australia. It is well known that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is a capped program. It is $150 million, and it was locked in as part of our election platform at the last election - $150 million spread across the applications that were to come in. In the last year we received some 3,200 applications for grants under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Around 72 per cent of these applicants have received their full grant entitlement in a single up-front payment. The average grant value was around $45,000. Due to the increased demand on the scheme, about 28 per cent of claimants received an initial payment of $60,000 - and that was the figure I referred to in the answer earlier this week - and they are eligible for a second tranche payment of 75.62 cents in the dollar. So the simple answer is that we are committed to spend $150 million on this program, and we have done that, but, because of the fantastic success as far as Australia's exports are concerned and the number of people participating in exports, we have basically an oversubscription. The rules have always been quite clear in terms of the threshold figure. As I said, 72 per cent of applicants have received their full entitlement and 28 per cent have already received $60,000 towards the export market activities that they have claimed for, and they will receive the balance - the 75.62 cents in the dollar - in that second tranche payment.I will take on notice the individual business that the member referred to in his question. For the member for Cunningham's information, out of the six EMD grants that went to his electorate - claimants were paid a total of $185,448 - only one is affected by this issue of the second tranche payment. That particular claimant claimed $60,236 and will receive $60,178 - only $58 short of the full claim.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her untiring efforts to ensure adequate aviation services to those very important tourism destinations in her electorate, particularly the Whitsundays. The union movement's targeting of Qantas as a prime target in its bargaining fees campaign is, it has to be said, as transparent as it is clumsy. It is a reflection of the class warfare mentality that still dominates Labor Party thinking, and it ought to be exposed as such. The union movement does not like Qantas because Qantas over the years has developed a relatively - I say relatively - efficient and productive work force that is not dominated by the union movement. The unions, of course, did like Ansett because they had a stranglehold over Ansett's work practices - the very work practices that made Ansett vulnerable and played a major role in destroying that airline. - No, I am not blaming the workers; I am blaming the unions. There is a very big difference. We are on the side of the workers, just as we are on the side of the wharfies, because they are productive people now, getting a good reward for professionalism. The unions now see the Federal Court's judgment of last week as the perfect opportunity to try and impose union control over Qantas's work practices. They want to entrench bargaining fees provisions in workplace agreements and that means that, in the end, companies will be forced to pay those fees.This is compulsory unionism by default - by making it cheaper for a Qantas worker to join a union than to pay those totally unwarranted bargaining fees. That is what it is, nothing more and nothing less. Qantas and its non-union workers will quite rightly resist this union push. Despite that, unfortunately there can be little doubt that the Electrical Trades Union and the Australian Services Union will be quite prepared to use industrial action to pursue their cause. It has to be said that the timing is extremely unfortunate. Just as the airline and tourism industries and associated industries are recovering well from the events of last year and September 11 in particular, we see a deliberate campaign to weaken our national airline flag carrier. But that is exactly what the union movement is threatening.The member asked whether I am aware of efforts to resolve this issue. The House will recall that the government have introduced legislation to ensure that the freedom of choice that currently exists to join or not join a union or industrial association is not compromised. We are seeking to resolve the matter. You would have thought that the opposition, as the alternative government, would have a clear policy position on this. One would have thought that the leadership would have demanded that they would have a position on it. But they do not. All we are seeing from the opposition is invective and abuse. That is what we are seeing. Hatred, the perpetuation of class warfare and personal abuse are no substitutes for leadership. They are not an adequate substitute for leadership.As has been noted in this place, Australians have become rather too cynical about their public institutions and the people who fill them. The Leader of the Opposition himself acknowledged that in this place at the beginning of this parliament, when he committed himself to raising standards -  - albeit with a smirk; but he did say it. More recently, on 29 May, he said, `We've got to rebuild trust in parliament as an institution.' Yet he condones the very sort of disgraceful behaviour that fuels the sense of cynicism and frustration that we as party leaders in this place profess to be concerned about. Robust debate is one thing. This is the clearing house of policy ideas. People in this place ought to have strong views on what they think will deliver the best outcomes for the Australian people. But when we allow it to degenerate into personal abuse and into the politics of hatred it is unacceptable. It fuels the very cynicism that the Leader of the Opposition says he is concerned about.  -  - Yes.</DOC>

In fairness to the Leader of the House, and I know you would always want to be fair to the Leader of the House -  -  - I think some opposite would like to be fair to the Leader of the House. I will check it, because he did say as I got up, in unmistakable terms, `Mate, I've been misrepresented.' -  - He did say that. But may I go to the substance? -  - I will go to the substance of the issue. Let me assume that you have put to me this proposition: do I agree or disagree with that as a description of the honorary federal treasurer? I make it clear that I have never said that of the honorary federal treasurer. I, in fact, have quite a warm regard for the honorary federal treasurer. It is a matter of public record that the honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal Party and I took strongly different views on the referendum for constitutional change. It is also a matter of public record -  -  - Oh, forget it! There is no point in continuing. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders both for his question and for his commitment to see that the highest standards are taught in Australian schools and, in particular, in the Western Port Secondary College in Hastings and the Rosebud Secondary College, amongst many other fine schools in his electorate.This government has been concerned, since its election in 1996, to see that Australian parents can have confidence in the schools to which they send their children. My predecessor, the member for Goldstein, put an enormous amount of effort in on behalf of the government to see that literacy and numeracy were tested in Australian schools, and now this government is committed to seeing that we report to parents the results of that testing. We are about to move into information and communication technology as well as science; and, of course, this government has also placed an enormous amount of importance on civics and democracy. Issues about which Australian parents are particularly concerned are not only the standards of teaching in literacy and numeracy but also the values based framework within which education is delivered. For example, you can open a newspaper in Australia on any day of the week in almost any part of the country and you can read these kinds of stories. The Sun Herald in Sydney, on Sunday, 23 June, published a story entitled `Schools call in playground police'. It said: A special police unit will be formed to respond to violent clashes at NSW public schools and to improve security in school playgrounds.This is something about which I think all Australians, and parents in particular, are especially concerned. They want to see that Australian governments and those in positions of leadership support security, safety and standards in Australian schools. This unit will respond to critical incidents as extreme as machete attacks.It is interesting that in this same article, under the heading `Principals worn out by stress' we are told that badly behaved students, staff problems and a lack of support from the New South Wales education department are the major causes of stress for school principals, according to two new surveys. The New South Wales Primary Principals Association, for example, said:The biggest factors affecting primary principals were student behaviour, abusive parents, and the New South Wales education department.I read the Bulletin this week and I saw that the member for Werriwa was quoted as saying:Look, this idea that politics can be too rough and too personal is a bit rich. I can take you to any sports field any Saturday morning and show you parents getting stuck into it. Having a go at the ref, yelling abuse. It's part of the Australian way. We're not a namby-pamby nation that hides our feelings. I think we're a nation that's willing to call a spade a spade ...He went on to say:... if need be, to pick up the spade and whack someone over the head with it.He went on further to say that he described himself as a `hater'.Shortly, I will be announcing some initiatives to support parents who are concerned to see that appropriate values are taught in schools, alongside the kinds of things that are equally important in reading, writing and communication. For example, Hugh Dillon, a magistrate in Sydney, nominated values like politeness, courage, justice, generosity, compassion, mercy, gratitude, humility, tolerance and humour. The question I put to the member for Werriwa and to the Leader of the Opposition is: if we are to lead our children on the basis that hatred is an acceptable virtue, will it make it easier or harder for parents to raise their children to be the kind of adults that we want them all to be?</DOC>

 - The comment that I made about a certain act of breathalysing on a major highway at 11 o'clock in the morning was made to draw attention to the fact that there were better things that a police force might do at 11 o'clock in the morning - like, for instance, protecting people whose houses get broken into. The reality is that at 11 o'clock in the morning on a major highway hundreds of miles from Perth it was most unlikely that police would be successful in using their resources to the best effect.  - I have been speaking throughout Australia, pointing out the lack of protection for the public -  - and the fact that many local authorities are spending millions of dollars on having to put security agents around their suburbs because of the fact that people are suffering home invasion and damage. In that regard, I thought my comment was quite appropriate.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Paterson for asking a question about jobs in small businesses in the electorate of Paterson. Small business operators right around this country are telling me and members on this side of the House that they are very nervous about the unfair dismissal laws. They believe that the laws discourage them from employing more people in their businesses. It was not so long ago that the member for Paterson, Senator Tierney and I visited the Tarro Pub. The Tarro Pub has previously been the strongest Labor booth in Paterson, over a number of elections. Until the last election, it was the strongest Labor booth in the seat of Paterson. The small business operators who were at the pub at the time, who had just finished work - the plumbers, the sparkies, all the building contractors and so on - pointed out to us that, without any doubt, the most significant issue for them was how they were being treated by the laws of the land in relation to unfair dismissal.They also pointed out that they felt quite disconnected from the Labor Party; they felt that the Labor Party, which had traditionally represented their interests, was not about representing their interests anymore and seemed to be carried away with their own rhetoric. They said that they believed that the Liberal Party and the National Party represented the interests of the small business people and the workers in Tarro. Peter Switzer, the small business editor of the Australian newspaper, said this week on radio 3AK:I think Simon Crean should be taking the Labor Party towards the small business constituency - That is wishful thinking, isn't it?He'll have to embrace such things as looking at changing unfair dismissals as it affects small business.Peter Switzer is telling the Labor Party to change the laws, and 1.2 million Australian small businesses are telling the Labor Party to change the laws. Why can't the Labor Party hear that Australian small business wants to employ more people but that the current unfair dismissal laws are a deterrent?It might have something to do with the fact that, through the composition of this parliament, only one side of the House represents the interests of small businesses - and that is the Liberal and National parties' side. For example, in just three years in parliament the member for Paterson has spoken in this House about small business on 17 occasions. Compare that, for example, with the member for Kingsford-Smith, who has been in politics for a very long time. He has been in this place for 12 years and he has mentioned small business three times. It is the 90-10 rule in the Labor Party: only 10 per cent of the Labor Party have ever had any extensive interaction with small business. So when it comes to a vote in the Senate on the unfair dismissal laws, when they have one senator, Senator Barney Cooney, who has ever had any association with small business, how can you expect the Labor Party to understand small business? They are going to do small business in the eye, they are going to do jobs in the eye and their last representative of small business in the Senate is retiring in two days. You have 48 hours to get it right, Simon! </DOC>

 - The first thing to say is that my priority and the priority of every member on this side of the House is to get the unemployed jobs. This government has created nearly one million jobs since we came to power in 1996. To answer your question directly, you have in front of you a discussion paper -  - My apologies, Mr Speaker. You do not have it in front of you; the member for Kingston does. If you wish to make comment on this discussion paper, I would welcome those comments. I would also point out to the member opposite, since he raises the issue of the quality of service of Job Network, that I actually have with me an inquiry into Job Network and several other services. I would like to read to you some of the findings:6.2 The committee finds that following the introduction of the Job Network in 1998 there has been a significant increase in the number of employment service providers in metropolitan Brisbane, regional centres and country Victoria.6.3 The committee finds that the increased number of employment services has resulted in job seekers having a greater choice of providers, better access to employment services, with some suburbs and towns gaining employment services for the first time under the Job Network.6.4 The committee finds the structural reform of the employment services has had a positive impact on the range of services and the mode of service delivery offered to job seekers by Centrelink in comparison to the Commonwealth Employment Service - which of course was delivered by your leader. Is this a report that was commissioned by the Prime Minister? Is this a report of a standing committee of this House? No, this is a report of the Victorian government. This is a report that was commissioned by the Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, and that has had unanimous support by both sides of the house in the Victorian -  - What is clear here is that this government is committed to an employment services regime which is delivering on the ground. When you take out of it the partisanship and the rhetoric and the hyperbole that you hear from those opposite you get down to the truth, which is that you have a bipartisan report of the Victorian parliament, led by the ALP, and you find that they actually agree that the Commonwealth's employment services under Job Network are providing more improved services than the previous government were. It is time that those opposite -  - spent more of their time developing policy and less time hating.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I know that he has great pride in the beautiful coastal environment of his electorate of Dunkley. One of the greatest achievements of the $1.5 billion first phase of the Natural Heritage Trust has been its remarkable success in generating local volunteer community action to conserve and restore the environment. The backbone of the trust has in fact been an army of some 400,000 volunteers who have acted to protect and enhance Australia's environment.I have been asked particularly about the coast and coastal care. I inform the House that today some 2,000 groups and 60,000 volunteers are engaged in Coastcare, which is a vital force in the care of our wetlands, beaches, dunes and vegetation and a key element in the implementation of the national coastal policy which is currently being developed. Many high profile Australians have engaged in and supported these wonderful Coastcare activities. For World Environment Day this year, comedian Bob Downe and basketball legend Andrew Gaze lent their names to the Coastcare campaign against garden weeds which have invaded many of our sand dunes and shores. The campaign attracted strong publicity around the country, many working bees were held, and it stimulated new practices in countless Australian gardens.The great success of the Natural Heritage Trust has been its capacity to put in place a framework to encourage volunteerism in our community. This has been constantly ridiculed by the Labor Party. The efforts of these 400,000 volunteers have been continually ridiculed as part of the achievement of the Natural Heritage Trust and yet volunteerism is one of the very great foundations of our community life. It shows that Australians will respond to a positive framework which is put in place. Political parties themselves benefit from volunteers, but to attract volunteers we need to be able to give them the message that there is respect in public life for their activities and for each other. Australians do not want their political leaders to be saying that hatred is an acceptable value in public life, that it is an acceptable motivation for political action. - Volunteers are a critical foundation of Australian community life. The government has been highly successful in mobilising these volunteers. But if we are to build on this Australian tradition of volunteerism - particularly to get people to volunteer in political life and be a part of our public life - then we have to create an environment in which they have respect and know that they will get respect for their participation. They do not want to hear leaders saying that gutter language is acceptable. They do not want to hear leaders saying that hatred is an acceptable motivation in political life. The Labor Party would not now be in the position that it is in in South Australia, as Senator Chris Schacht said on Lateline on Monday, where it is controlled by two people -  - As Senator Schacht said on Monday night -  - I am talking about the importance of volunteerism to our community life and our public life. That is exemplified by the success of the framework the government has put in place. Senator Chris Schacht on Monday night referred to the fact that the whole of the South Australian branch of the Labor Party is controlled by two union secretaries. That reveals the weakness of the Labor Party in stimulating community action - </DOC>

 - I will take the second part of the question first. I am always happy to meet a delegation of people from country Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister, over quite a number of years, has brought many delegations to me representing the interests of country people. In the last couple of weeks, I have had two meetings with a sugar task force of members of the Liberal and National parties who have conveyed to me the concerns of the Australian sugar industry. - The question about the proceeds of the sale of Sydney airport gives me the opportunity to remind the parliament that the proceeds of that sale do not go into the revenue side of the budget. There is a common misapprehension in the Australian community - and I fear it is a misapprehension in this place, as well - that, if you get $5 billion or net $4.2 billion for the sale of Sydney airport, it is another $4.2 billion into the revenue side of the budget this year or next year; it is not. It does not go into the budget bottom line, and therefore any expenditure notionally sourced from the $4.2 billion is not offset by the receipt of that $4.2 billion. Therefore, it would represent an additional expenditure over and above the revenues that the government gets through its budget. As the Treasurer and others have indicated - and I re-indicate - the proceeds of that sale will be used to retire Labor's debt.However, let me make it clear that we continue to be willing to take initiatives to help country users of airlines. We have in place a number of arrangements in relation to the use of Sydney airport. In my 6½ years as Prime Minister, in all of the deliberations in which I have been involved in relation to the airport needs of the greater Sydney area, we have always given priority to the needs of regional commuters.I remind the member for New England that, when the airline industry was convulsed in September last year with the double whammy of the Ansett collapse and the impact on the tourist industry of the terrorist attack, we were there to provide support for the regional airlines and a tourism rescue package, both of which were of great assistance to people in country areas. The member for New England gives me the opportunity to say to country commuters that nothing that we have done in relation to Sydney airport will hurt rural users of internal airline services in New South Wales or anywhere else in Australia. I can give an undertaking to the House that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect fully and adequately the interests of rural users of airline services in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Obviously, representing a large part of rural Victoria, he was significantly interested in the reforms that we have undertaken on the waterfront. They have generated enormous efficiencies as far as Australia's rural exports are concerned. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen Australia's export effort grow from $99 billion to $154 billion, and in recent years that has been driven by greater efficiencies on Australia's waterfront. Yesterday, in an answer to a question, the Deputy Prime Minister indicated the significant improvement that has taken place on the Australian waterfront. - We have seen the capacity of the waterfront increase from 16.9 container movements per hour up to about 26.6 container movements per hour in March 2002. Unquestionably, this adds significantly to the efficiency and the competitiveness of Australia's exporters. Mr Ian Donges, the former president of the NFF, said: We believe the new level of productivity will enable more farmers to compete on an even keel for lucrative international markets.It is a clear indication of the breadth of the effort that this government is putting into ensuring the future livelihoods of the Australian farm community. This goes right across the economic reforms I mentioned before: what we are doing on the international front in the pursuit of markets and trade liberalisation for our agricultural exports and what we can do here at home in generating a much more efficient domestic economy and getting our products over the wharves. That is what this government has done, and we have done that in the last six or seven years since we have been in office. It is worth noting that during that process of reform of the Australian waterfront we were opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party and its union masters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question and commend him for his dedication and perseverance for the electors of his electorate in a way which he has shown in other activities in his life. Indeed, this is the sort of question one might expect from the opposition if they had any interest in aged care in Australia. But we have only had some nonsensical question from the member for Grayndler. I inform the House that yesterday I announced the largest ever increase in residential funding subsidies to aged care in Australia. That announcement of a 4.5 per cent increase to aged care subsidies in Australia will take effect from 1 July this year. That includes a 4.8 per cent increase for nursing homes or high-level care, a four per cent increase for hostels or low-level care, also a 4.5 per cent increase for multipurpose services and a 3.3 per cent for community aged care packages. This is part of the delivery by the coalition government of its election commitment to increase the funding for aged care in Australia. In fact, this is part of a $211 million increase to aged care as part of this budget which was announced recently by the Treasurer, bringing the expenditure on aged care in Australia in the budget next year to some $4.3 billion. The coalition has also recently announced an additional 8,231 aged care places, and I am pleased to note for the member for Macarthur that that includes some 120 new residential places to the planning region which includes his electorate and also additional numbers of community aged care packages. Since the year 2000 there has been an allocation of some 695 additional places to the member for Macarthur's planning region. So this is good news for frail and older Australians as part of what this government is doing in delivering aged care services to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I have never called for the linkage that the Leader of the Opposition suggests. - Never. - Never, and I urge the Leader of the Opposition to produce the evidence that I have called for that linkage. Let me just say that the last thing I would want to do in any industry is to go out seeking confrontation. The only people who have sought confrontation in the motor industry are the AMWU - a union which has brought that industry to its knees three times in the last 12 months, a union which has donated $3 million to the Labor Party over the last six years and a union which controls the largest single block vote inside the Victorian Labor Party. They are the people who want confrontation, and they are the people who the Leader of the Opposition has never ever criticised or repudiated. This Leader of the Opposition can never ever bring himself to say a critical word about a union or a strike; he has never seen a strike that he did not support. This government support jobs, we support investment, we support entrepreneurialism, we support dynamism and we support a great car industry with a great future in a great economy for Australia's sake.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I am conscious of the fact that in particular there is a large Royal Australian Air Force establishment in her electorate, and I know that many of her constituents are keenly interested in the issue that she has raised. As members will be aware, Australia will need to replace the FA18 Hornets and the F111 strike aircraft from the year 2012, and because of this the national security committee of cabinet agreed yesterday that Australia will commence negotiations with the United States to join the decade-long development phase of the United States $200 billion joint strike fighter program.This is a very major and a very important decision by the government which looks to the long-term defence acquisition needs not only of the Royal Australian Air Force but of Australia's entire defence capacity. The decision to commit up to $US150 million over 10 years as a partner in the program will put Australia at the forefront of developing the world's most advanced and biggest combat aircraft project over the next 30 years and, importantly, there are very substantial benefits for Australia in being involved in this project from the outset. Through the JSF program the Australian Defence Force will have access to levels of capability and technology in the aircraft that will be a generation ahead of other contemporary aircraft. The partnership will also lead to significant savings and ensure that Australian industry is able to compete for JSF work.The JSF is a stealthy, supersonic, multirole fighter. Some 3,000 aircraft are expected to be produced for the United States and the United Kingdom alone, with total production worldwide likely to be more than 4,500 aircraft. The $20 billion development phase is aimed at developing the JSF from a demonstrator to a mature combat aircraft. The cabinet having taken the decision that it did yesterday, the defence department will now start negotiating the terms of Australian involvement in this phase of the project with a view to ensuring maximum Australian industry participation.I want to say to the House that this announcement is just the latest phase of the very careful and steady attention that this government has given to Australia's defence capability over the last 6½ years. The defence white paper represented the biggest reassessment of Australia's defence capability and defence needs in over a generation. The additional commitments we made as a result of the terrorist attacks last year and the other strategic needs that were assessed subsequent to the white paper are further evidence of our determination to see that this country has an adequate defence capability. This decision, which represents the essence of the long-term planning which is needed in relation to defence capability of this character, is a further example of the government's determination to ensure that the Australian defence forces have the best possible assets at their disposal for the defence of Australia.</DOC>

 - I will check that quote: I do not take anything from the Leader of the Opposition as read. In terms of the Productivity Commission, I have a greater respect for protocol, obviously, than the Leader of the Opposition. That report is not being released for another hour and 20 minutes. I can tell you, though, from the discussions that I have had with industry, including the Automotive Council yesterday, that if the Labor Party listened to what the car industry was saying it would support this government on instituting industrial relations reform. Let me quote from the President of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Holden's Peter Hanenberger:The enterprise bargaining process ... provides a framework for developing win-win outcomes if properly applied.He goes on to say:However, the disputes that have derailed the industry in recent months have been outside that process and, in some cases, have been simply unlawful.He then went on further to say:We have asked all parties to secure support for some simple, commonsense steps for industrial relations. We want the introduction of cooling off periods to avoid unnecessary industrial action. We are also seeking increased protection for innocent third parties at risk of significant damage as a result of such action.I can also assure you that he and other members of the council, along with Bob Herbert, who was quoted in this House earlier this week, are also in support of secret ballots. Let me quote what Bob Herbert said on radio this week. As Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, he said: ... you also need to ensure that people can't take industrial action which damages third parties.He went on to say:And if we had laws based around that, I think the industrial relations environment in the car industry and elsewhere would be very much better. - The opposition leader has every opportunity to improve the industrial relations situation in the car industry. - As Alan Wood, the economics writer for the Australian, said last week:Changes to federal legislation are required to make strike action more difficult ......				...				...These changes can be implemented only with support in the Senate.He went on to say:This is the real challenge for Simon Crean, not Mickey Mouse fiddling with numbers at Labor Party conferences. Is he prepared to support the legislation needed to curb the nationally destructive activities of unions such as the AMWU and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union or isn't he? The future of Australia's automotive industry, and others, hangs on the answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that, as one who comes from the biggest electorate in Australia and I think the biggest electorate in the world, he has a very real interest in the Year of the Outback and the promotion it brings of this last great frontier, which is of interest, I think, to all Australians and, hopefully, to people in other parts of world as well. We are now six months into the Year of the Outback and I think it is timely as we contemplate the winter recess to indicate that things are going extremely well. During the winter recess everyone ought to seek to put an event - there are about 2,000 to choose from - from the program for Year of the Outback on their calendar for the winter recess.I would like to thank all members of this House who have supported it, particularly those who might be said to, in the general sense, represent the outback, and that includes the member who asked the question and the members for Lingiari, Grey, Parkes, Maranoa and Kennedy. In particular, their electorates are truly representative of outback Australia. To be fair, too, I think the media deserve recognition. They have covered the Year of the Outback and its personalities, running profiles of people in rural and regional Australia and programs on rural and regional areas, and they have reported events in a terrific way during the year. I note again that the government is certainly supporting the Year of the Outback strongly. We have contributed something in the order of $3.2 million to various programs and supporting mechanisms to ensure that it is a success.The member asked what benefits this initiative is bringing to communities and businesses. They are quite considerable and are reflected well in a couple of letters that have been forwarded to me. One comes from the Albert Park Motor Inn in Longreach. The principal of the business, Lance Smith, writes to Bruce Campbell, the Chairman of Year of the Outback, that:I just wanted to put in writing the profound difference that YOTO - Year of the Outback - has made to our ... business forecasts.... Already this year we have seen a healthy growth in occupancies surrounding special events such as Easter in the Outback, the Qantas Founders Museum opening, Aramac's Harry Redford Cattle Drive and more.He goes on to say that their coach numbers are way up, their Queensland Rail packages and special air charters are well up and their bookings for July are ahead of last year's actuals and will improve dramatically, and predicts a 20 to 25 per cent increase in the numbers going through their two businesses for the first six months of this financial year. He goes on to express their appreciation for the interest generated in the bush and the millions of extra dollars going into their banks.I met today with state leaders of the Country Women's Association, whom I see in the gallery this afternoon. They do a fine job in representing women right across the nation.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - The Prime Minister met with them yesterday. They, too, have been able to fill us in on the positive benefits of Year of the Outback.I will refer to just one other letter in part, an important one, given the importance of health to people in remote parts of the country. The Royal Flying Doctor Service reports `an unprecedented level of public awareness' being enjoyed by the service as a result of Outback 2002. The public affairs manager comments:General public interest inquiries and requests from schools for project material - particularly from urban areas - have escalated dramatically since the beginning of the year. Specific requests for - Royal Flying Doctor Service - representation at events and guest speaking engagements have also significantly increased.That is what Outback 2002 is all about: creating awareness, and building business and investment opportunities, particularly related to tourism. It is one of the most fascinating parts on earth. Although it covers most of the landmass of Australia there are only about 180,000 people out there, with a few major cities. I certainly encourage all members and people listening today to get out there this year and make this the time they experience it. As Ernie Dingo said, `Go on, get out there.'</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the shadow spokesman on family and community services for asking this question, because it puts into absolute contrast the position that the coalition is taking to help people with disabilities and the opportunistic position that has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party. The interesting thing with this new approach of the coalition government is that we will be grandfathering those people who are currently on a disability support pension to the year 2003, because you were unable and unwilling and unresponsive, even to come to the negotiating table, when it came to helping people with disabilities - totally unwilling. - The interesting thing is that what we are doing is exactly what you tried to do when you changed the invalid pension back in 1990 and partly created the problem that we have today. Back in 1990, 300,000 were on an invalid pension. That figure is now 650,000. When you talk about classes, I would like to recall the member for Werriwa, and even yourself -  - When the member for Werriwa spoke, he said:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the disability support pension ... It is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians.He said that some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000, and also said:The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.Here is a shadow spokesperson who advocated not so long ago a cutting of the disability support pension which would have affected 400,000 people on DSP. The proposal that we have put in place is all about focusing on those people's capacity to work; it is not focusing on their inability. The legislation that will be coming before the House this afternoon is grandfathering those people to 2003. We are still fully committed to providing 73,000 places to assist those people.I think it is outrageous that the Labor Party are not prepared at all even to come to the negotiating table. Yet they created this problem when they deliberately changed the invalid pension back to DSP. That is why we now have the highest growth rate in the DSP in Australia. It is this government, the coalition government, that are always looking after people who cannot look after themselves. When it comes to people with disabilities we are the ones putting in more money than ever before. Likewise, we are the ones putting more money now into the Commonwealth-state disability agreement and also employment assistance. Your position is totally hypocritical on this, particularly when you are on record yourself, member for Lillee, as advocating changes for those people to help in the area of disability support pension. These figures on this graph I am holding show it all. This is why we have that rapid growth now happening in DSP. Something needs to be done so that future generations, particularly, are not left to languish on welfare dependency. This government is absolutely committed. That is why we are providing 73,000 places. That is why we are now proposing to grandfather it. I think it is totally irresponsible and opportunistic -  - The only two classes here involve the opportunism of the Labor Party where they do not support these changes.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank you for allowing the member for Sturt the call today. I thank him for his question. This is the last question time before the second anniversary of the introduction of the new tax system, which commenced on 1 July 2000. I want to pay tribute to the businesses of Australia for the transition to the new tax system and for all of the work that it involved. We estimated that 2.1 million Australian business numbers would be sought; in fact, four million Australian business numbers were sought. We anticipated that 1.4 million businesses would apply for GST registration; in fact, 2.1 million sought GST registration.As we look back over the last two years, we can see that the Australian economy has remained very strong in the face of a world downturn during the first two years of the new taxation system. Whereas the American economy went into recession, as did much of Europe and Japan, the Australian economy has run strongly. Two years after tax reform was introduced, our economy is growing faster than any other economy in the developed world. Labor said GST would cause a recession; Australia leads the world in terms of growth. Our unemployment rate today, at 6.3 per cent, is about the same as it was two years ago but, importantly, in the first two years of tax reform 241,000 new jobs were created in the Australian economy. Labor said tax reform would lead to job losses; in fact, we have had job rises. Two years ago, inflation was 3.2 per cent; today, it is 2.9 per cent. Inflation has actually come down; Labor said that tax reform would push it up. Today's Australian reports that optimism has soared in the first two years of the tax system. It states:Voters' confidence in maintaining or improving their standard of living has risen 21 percentage points since the introduction of the GST in July 2000 ...I am sure both sides of the House welcome that. Some things have changed in the last two years. Two years ago, only one side of this House supported retaining a GST as part of our tax system and now both sides of the House do. We welcome the fact that the Labor Party now supports the coalition in retaining the GST as part of our taxation system, now that the hard work is done. We wish that the Leader of the Opposition had not wasted the time of the parliament for two years with his opportunistic campaign, opposing a tax system which he now supports.Some things remind you of what was occurring two years ago. The regrettable interview in the Bulletin of this week reminded me of an interview in the Bulletin two years ago, when John Della Bosca was interviewed by Maxine McKew. John Della Bosca advised the Labor Party to give away roll-back. He said roll-back would only make the tax system more complicated. Della was almost run out of the Labor Party for saying that. He was going to be the ALP president and he had to stand aside, and the way was made clear, I think, for Greg Sword to become the ALP president in his place. We would like to form the `bring back Della' society on this side of the House. I think Della was badly treated. All he did was tell the truth and he had his head taken off. Della has been walking headless through the Australian community for the last two years and really he deserves to be reinstated. He was the person who had it right. The person who had it wrong, of course, was the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who wasted the time of this parliament with an opportunistic campaign and was rewarded with promotion to the position of leader.Some things change, but some things do not. Although Labor now supports the GST, Labor's opportunism has not changed. All that has happened is that Labor's opportunism has moved on to new heights in respect of new things. Labor today opportunistically opposes measures to properly base the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. To those Labor backbenchers who probably have had no experience of real Labor leadership, because they have only been in the parliament over the last five years, I say, `Your position will be the same. Your leadership will tell you they are opposed to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes. But, if changes are introduced, they will keep them or will, if changes are not introduced, propose even larger ones should they ever get elected.'We think the important thing for leadership in the Australian community is to be right first, not to be right a long time after the event. The important thing is to do what is necessary for Australia, not to wallow in political opportunism. The important things are to make our economy straight, create jobs and give the Australian people the opportunities that they deserve. That is the difference between coalition government and Labor opportunism.</DOC>

 - That question has already been asked and it will be answered exactly as it was previously. This government have introduced programs for asthma and diabetes. We introduced a new program for the treatment of asthma in last year's budget. That was something that had never been done before: a new care management program. We did the same in relation to diabetes, and that was also something that had never been done before. If you want to know what the government think about asthma and diabetes, have a look at what we have done.Those parents that I have come across who have been able to take advantage of the new asthma program have had the opportunity to take their children to doctors to be advised on a preventative program, to have it assessed and to have the ailment managed before it becomes a crisis. Notwithstanding the Labor Party's false accusation that the price of Ventolin, for example, would increase, the price of Ventolin is unchanged by any of the measures announced in the budget. It is a shame that the Labor Party plays with people's fears in the dishonest way that it has. If the Labor Party had a leader, the Labor Party would knock into shape the people who made those false accusations. You cannot discipline if you cannot lead, and that is the problem with the member for Hotham at the moment.We have made this point in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: those people that want a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will want to put it on a sustainable basis. That was the argument that Mr Keating made in 1990 when he introduced a copayment, when he said he was worried that the cost of the scheme could go to $2 billion per annum. Today the cost of the scheme is at $4 billion per annum and, as our projections show, it is the fastest growing area of Commonwealth expenditure. We said in relation to the tax system that the people who cared about social services were the people who would introduce a tax system which would fund them, and that is why we reformed the tax system. The people that care about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are those who will introduce a scheme which will fund it. That is where the coalition leads and that is where the Labor Party stands condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his excellent question. Since March 1996, Australians have enjoyed more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes. Thanks to the diligence of Australian workers, the creativity of Australian managers and also the policies that this government has put in place, there have been nearly one million new jobs since March 1996. Average weekly earnings are up 12 per cent in real terms and strikes are at the lowest levels since records were first kept in 1913. But, thanks to a few ultramilitant unions, there are still some significant areas of industrial disruption. I regret to tell the House that in the last month some 40 per cent of days lost through strikes took place in the construction industry and 50 per cent of days lost through strikes occurred in the metal industry, particularly the motor industry. This handful of strike-happy unions provides the biggest donations to the Labor Party and has the biggest block vote inside the Labor Party. Between them, the CFMEU and the AMWU have provided $6 million to the Labor Party over the last six years. They have helped to engineer the Socialist Left takeover of the Victorian ALP. Changing to a 50-50 rule will not make any difference - 60-40 or 50-50, what does it matter? The only thing that counts is the fundamental democratic principle of one vote, one value.I have been asked about the motor industry. I want to say that this government is fully committed to the motor industry, which provides 50,000 jobs and $5 billion a year in exports. By contrast, members opposite are fully committed to the AMWU, which has brought the motor industry to its knees three times in just 12 months. The AMWU has caused nearly 30,000 stand-downs and nearly $400 million in lost production. This government supports people who create jobs. That opposition supports people who destroy jobs. This government supports Peter Hanenberger, the head of Holden, who said yesterday:We will not stand by and let our people be affected by the illegal industrial actions of others.By contrast, members opposite are in lock step with Doug Cameron, who most recently has had his union threatening the long-term future of 500 firms in the car component industry. The unions pay their bills, the unions pick their members - they have got no choice but to support what the unions want. The Leader of the Opposition has never seen a strike that he did not support.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Corio's question is quite extraordinary as it is based on a completely inaccurate statement. The chairman of the committee was actually Senator Crane. -  - The member for Corio might seek to check the Senate Hansard and note who tabled the report in parliament, and then it will be abundantly clear who was the chairman of the committee. But apart from that gross inaccuracy in the member's question, the whole basis of the question was a demonstration of Labor's complete policy vacuum when it comes to dealing with agricultural issues. They are great at hating, but when it comes to any kind of policy issue they are a total vacuum. We had the opposition spokesman on this issue, Senator O'Brien, rushing around suggesting to everybody that they should be granted a larger share of the US quota, but never once did he go to a meatworks and say, `This is the meatworks we're going to take the quota away from.' He never went to Capricornia and talked to the striking meatworkers of Rockhampton and told them that Labor's plan is to take quota away from the meatworkers there and give it to somebody else. He never went to the seat of Oxley and told the meatworkers of Oxley that they were to have their jobs sacrificed so quota could be given to a meatworks in another town.Labor knew full well, like everyone else, that there are 378,000 tonnes to be granted and that a tonne given to a meatworks in one town is a tonne taken away from another. It was very easy for people to list meatworks that they would like to give additional tonnages to. I would like to give additional tonnages to every meatworks in the country, but the reality is that it does not go around. Sooner or later, someone had to make a decision about where it was going to go. The industry could not do it. They argued for months and could not reach agreement, then finally said, `The minister should do it.' The minister came out with a detailed plan that shared the pain as fairly and as evenly as possible.The Senate met for a couple of weeks, took evidence from people all over the place, got a full taste of how difficult the politics are within the beef industry and heard everywhere from everybody how they all wanted additional quota. Then, after all this furore and name-calling and these vicious insults, the Senate came up with a recommendation that changed only one of the points of my plan; the rest of it was completely accepted. All they did was alter the discretionary tonnage from 14,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes. The rest of the formula - the arrangements for the distribution of the quota - was all left completely intact. They hardly dumped the quota, as the honourable member for Corio suggested in his question; the reality is they accepted the entire plan. They just asked for a bit of additional discretionary tonnage. The effect of the Senate recommendations is that we now have to find 30,000 tonnes of quota to distribute on a discretionary basis. The only way that can be done is to take 30,000 tonnes off the other meatworks of Australia. So the reality is that about 4½ per cent of the quota will be taken from every allocation in Australia. Jobs will undoubtedly be affected as a result of that loss in quota in some towns so that others can obtain some quota.I have accepted that recommendation of the Senate. The government is tabling in parliament today the regulations for the new quota system, and we will hopefully be gazetting an order for the new arrangements for the quota tomorrow. That will give the industry some certainty after all the disruption that the Labor Party have endeavoured to create in this whole exercise and all of the uncertainty that they have created in meatworks around the countryside. We have resolved the issue. In addition to that, I have decided to set up an independent tribunal to deal with these issues in the future to ensure that there can be no perception that people are dividing quota amongst themselves to benefit their own establishment and that the arrangements will dealt with fairly and honestly, hopefully without the interference of Labor spokesmen who only want to destroy the industry and cause disruption and who do not want to allow Australian cattlemen and Australian meat processors to get on with the business of exporting our products around the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for what, as this is the last full sitting day of this parliamentary session and as it is coming up to 30 June, is a very timely question. It happens that I do have in front of me the fruits of some very prescient research on the subject. It is very revealing. I think it reveals first and foremost that one of the differences between this government and some governments that went before it is that this government do not regard question time as a courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government. We actually believe that, for a parliamentary system to work effectively, you must have accountability of the executive to the parliament. The most accountable minutes of any parliamentary day are in fact those of the very exercise that we are now engaged in. It is the one time of the parliamentary day that commands the more or less full attention of members on both sides of the House.That research so presciently done by somebody reveals some very interesting things - including what I might call a remarkable productivity improvement. In fact, I am so impressed I might refer it to the Productivity Commission for a full report! It demonstrates - and I think all members of the House will be interested in these figures - that between March 1983, which you will remember is when the Hawke Labor government came to power, and March 1996, a period of some 13 years when the Australian Labor Party was in office, a total of 9,248 questions without notice were asked. I might inform the House that between March 1996 and 26 June 2002, which is the current term of the coalition government - and that is a period of less than half the number of years that the Hawke and Keating governments were in office - there has already been a total of 7,811 questions asked. In other words, if we keep going at that rate and if the Australian people were to continue to repose their confidence, it is pretty obvious that the productivity of this government in terms of answering questions far outstrips that of either the Hawke or Keating governments.I should say, in fairness to my predecessor in office but one, that the performance of the Hawke government was infinitely better than the performance of the Keating government. It is instructive that, in terms of questions asked of prime ministers, in the term of the Fraser government there were 1,621 questions asked of the Prime Minister, and during the Hawke government there were 1,551 - despite the fact that Mr Hawke was Prime Minister for about 18 months longer than Mr Fraser. But the real bobby-dazzler, the piece de resistance - or should I say the `Paul de resistance' - is from 1992 to 1996, under the Keating government. In four years and three months there were 719 questions asked. In the time that I have been Prime Minister - just on six years and three months - a total of 1,798 questions have been asked. It is now 1,800.The point of this should not be lost on those who take a close interest in these issues. In the end, the real determinate of the accountability of a government and of a prime minister is their willingness to front up here day after day to answer questions. My predecessor treated parliament with contempt. He introduced the magisterial, contemptuous approach to parliament of having a parliamentary question time for the Prime Minister only two days a week. It was a metaphor for the contempt he felt for his parliamentary colleagues. He not only regarded the Senate as unrepresentative swill, he also treated his parliamentary colleagues - including those on his own side - with complete contempt.I said when we were campaigning for office in 1996 that one of the things we would do would be to restore the importance of parliament in the political life of the nation. In the end, it is what governments are held accountable for in this parliament at this question time which is the greatest expression of the Australian form of parliamentary democracy. On that measure this government has been more representative, more responsive, more democratic and more in touch with the aspirations of the Australian people than any of its predecessors.</DOC>

 - If I may just comment on the issue raised by the Prime Minister, it is not so much the 1,798 questions you received but the 1,798 great answers you have given -  - that are an important element of this. The 1,798 great answers -  - For several years, the government has been considering - or, more particularly, Biosecurity Australia has been considering - an application from the Philippines to import bananas into Australia. The application was lodged quite some time ago. There has been great difficulty in receiving the necessary technical information from the Philippines, because a lot of it was simply not available in that country. So that process has taken quite a long time. It is true that the Minister for Trade gave an assurance to the Philippines that we would have an import risk assessment published by the end of June, and I can inform the House that it is my understanding that the Director of Quarantine intends to release that draft import risk assessment on Monday morning.The particular technical document referred to by the questioner is not a formal part of the import risk assessment process. We have not normally provided that kind of detailed document, which addressed some of the formula issues associated with calculating elements of risk and the like. Every element of the process required under our import risk assessment has been met and the full times have been allowed in relation to this banana investigation. Indeed, since this government has come to office, in stark contrast with what happened under the previous government, this process is now a very open and consultative one.There has been consultation with all interested parties and there have been numerous meetings with the banana industry, with the applicants and with others to assess all of these issues. The paper associated with the issues, upon which there is a requirement to respond within a certain number of days, was in fact distributed many months ago. This is a second paper that was distributed in addition to what is required under the process. The appropriate amount of time has been provided for the industry to respond to those issues. I am confident that Biosecurity Australia has dealt with this issue according to its usual professional standards. Australia's conservative approach and determination to ensure that no diseases will enter this country as a result of imported food products - those high standards - will be maintained in relation to the import risk assessment. - Frankly, I am appalled at the interjections of the member for Hunter and the member for Corio. The Labor Party have form on this matter. Never forget the political donations that they have received from the Filipino banana lobby. How can they stand up in this House and ask questions on this issue while at the same time they are taking money from the banana lobby in the Philippines? They have no honesty or integrity in this matter. We will deal with the issues professionally and appropriately.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. I will answer the second part of it first. I have a one-word answer: jobs, particularly in regional Australia and particularly in electorates like the electorate of Farrer represented by the member asking the question. Since 1996, as I have continually outlined in this House, our export earnings have gone from $99 billion in 1996 to $154 billion last year. That constitutes about 20 per cent of Australia's economic wealth. Our export and trade policies, along with our sound economic management, have seen the creation of 972,000 jobs in Australia in that time. So we have seen exports rise to $154 billion and we have seen 972,000 new jobs. One in five of those jobs is generated by exports, and one in four is in regional Australia, in electorates like the member for Farrer's.I will quickly run through a few sectors. The automotive sector has been the subject of great debate in the parliament this week and will be the subject of debate in coming weeks, no doubt, when we look at the PC report that is being released as I speak. There is an automotive company in Albury, in the member for Farrer's electorate, called BTR Engineering. In the last 18 months, BTR Engineering have created 300 new jobs as a result of their exports, particularly to the Ssangyong company in the automotive sector in Korea. Earlier this year I had the opportunity of visiting that factory with the representatives of BTR. Those exports have created 300 new jobs in that area.In the primary industry sector, earnings have increased by about $10 billion, or 43 per cent, over the last six years - and not just in the high-profile primary industry sectors. For example, there is a company in the electorate of the member for Hinkler called AusChilli. It is a family owned business that exports chilli and capsicum products across the world to the food services industry. They employ 50 people in the electorate of Hinkler. These are all jobs being created in the regions of Australia.I cannot miss the opportunity of mentioning the now world famous Australian wine industry. In 1996, wine sector earnings from exports were $550 million. Last year, export wine sales earned $1.75 billion for the Australian economy. Australia is the single largest exporter of wine outside the European Union and in April this year our wine export sales for a 12-month period exceeded domestic sales for the first time in history. While I am talking about the wine industry, I would like to mention that one of the outstanding companies contributing to the export effort is from your own electorate, Mr Speaker - the electorate of Wakefield. BRL Hardy, with their prime brand Banrock Station, in the Speaker's electorate, just happened to be the exporter of the year last year. They have really achieved some outstanding statistics. In 1997 Banrock Station exported only 218,000 cases of wine. Last year that rose to two million cases of wine and they are well on track to achieve their target of 2.6 million cases this year.The services sector has grown - the member for Cunningham will be interested in this - and is now earning $31.3 billion for the Australian economy. Part of the services sector is education, and I know that the minister for education is very engaged in driving the export growth in education: $4.2 billion in 2001. The great example of that is the University of Wollongong in the member for Cunningham's electorate. The University of Wollongong has one of the largest proportions of international students in an Australian university: 4,400 out of the university's 15,000 students currently enrolled come from more than 70 international countries. That is helping earn $4.2 billion in education services. Those members representing the Hunter Valley, particularly the member for Shortland -  - The Leader of the Opposition does not want to hear this -  - but the member for Shortland does, I am sure. There is a company in the Hunter called Hydromatic Engineering, which exports mining equipment around the world. They employ 100 staff at their Redhead site in the electorate of the member for Shortland. They also employ 12 staff in Mackay in the member for Dawson's electorate. Because of export growth, they have been able to make a contribution to that growth of 972,000 jobs over the last six years or so.In conclusion, this government has one of the most ambitious trade policy agendas of any government in Australia's history. We are renowned across the world as being very aggressive in our pursuit of advocating trade liberalisation across the world. We will remain so. It is only this coalition government that will continue to have the courage to pragmatically pursue export efforts across the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the press release that Senator Ellison released on 25 June in response to questions that the Leader of the Opposition asked about this matter. The first thing that Senator Ellison said, contrary to the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition in the parliament three days ago, was that he, Senator Ellison, had never lobbied the Financial Action Task Force, the FATF, or the OECD, for that matter, about Nauru. - If you listen you will learn more. - Furthermore, if he had read the press release, it would have saved me saying all this. Australia has not at any stage lobbied to have Nauru taken off the FATF's list of Noncooperative Countries and Territories, which is known as the NCCT List. At January's FATF meeting in Hong Kong, Australian officials sought to have FATF countermeasures against Nauru lifted on the basis that Nauru had passed anti-money-laundering legislation in December. I explained the other day to the Leader of the Opposition that the Attorney-General's Department had provided some assistance to Nauru in drawing up that anti-money-laundering legislation. The officials did not seek to have Nauru removed from the Noncooperative Countries and Territories List. Countermeasures are a FATF measure that is additional to placement -  - You asked the question. I would have thought that, since this is the parliament, you might have some interest in the answer. - Since the facts of your question have been demonstrated to be entirely wrong, I would have thought that you should listen. - Let me repeat: the officials did not seek to have Nauru removed from the Noncooperative Countries and Territories List. Countermeasures are a Financial Action Task Force measure that is additional to placement on the NCCT List. Let me finally say that, at its annual meeting in Paris last week, the FATF decided to maintain countermeasures against Nauru because it had not fully addressed outstanding concerns of FATF members with respect to its anti money laundering laws. Australian officials supported this decision. They did not lobby to have countermeasures lifted or to have Nauru removed from the NCCT List.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. It is a very important and a very significant question in terms of Australia's national interest, and I know that the people of Wannon feel well represented by him in this parliament. This government has a strong and mature relationship with the United States of America. I think it is fair to say that our relationship with the United States has never been stronger. That was illustrated by the Prime Minister's visit and the extraordinary access and welcome that he received when he was in Washington recently. I do not think that any of us can recall a visit by an Australian Prime Minister to Washington that has been more successful.The government makes no apology whatsoever for Australia's close relationship with the United States and the priority that we attach to the Australia-United States alliance. The ANZUS alliance makes a very significant contribution to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Our relationship is underpinned by our common values, and it is reflected very much in our support for the United States at the moment in the war against terrorism. Indeed, late last year, when the government invoked the ANZUS alliance, this was the first time that such an invocation had taken place since the signing of the ANZUS alliance 50 years earlier.Australia and the United States also have a burgeoning trade and investment relationship, which is massively in the interests of the Australian people. The United States is Australia's second largest trading partner, and our merchandise exports last year to the United States grew by eight per cent to nearly $12 billion - that is, 10 per cent of our exports. Since the East Asian economic crisis, Australian exports to the United States have grown faster than to any other major trading partner.The United States is importantly - and this is an aspect of the relationship which is fundamental to jobs in this country - Australia's second-largest source of investment after the European Union, if you take all 15 countries of the EU as a whole. The US is now host to over 50 per cent of Australia's direct investment overseas, having superseded the United Kingdom in 1998 as the leading destination for Australian foreign direct investment. When you look at the importance of this economic relationship and take into account that in 1980 the United States was about 25 per cent of global GDP, whereas today the United States is around 34 per cent of global GDP, you can see the value that Australia would get if we were able to negotiate successfully a comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States. While we have no doubts about the difficulty of the task that lies ahead in negotiating a satisfactory agreement, the benefits that we would get from such integration with 34 per cent of the global economy would be simply massive.All of this is not to say that we do not from time to time have policy differences with the United States. It is well known that the government was very critical of the decision the United States made recently on steel tariffs. But the other side of that argument is that the strength of the relationship that we have with the United States was fundamental to our getting a successful outcome to our problems on steel with the United States. If we had taken a dismissive and negative approach to the United States, I can guarantee the House that it would have been impossible to get the deal that we got with the United States on steel for steel workers in Australia. We are still working to further progress the issue of steel with the United States, but the success we have had is an achievement unprecedented in Australia's trading relationship with the United States. We took on the United States over lamb in the World Trade Organisation, and we won the case. I think I am right in saying that our lamb exports have continued to grow successfully with the United States. -  - The mockery, the interjections and the sneers from the opposition illustrate a point that I have argued for many years, not just while I have been Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that is that the Labor Party at its heart has always been equivocal about the relationship with the United States. I think that has been very manifest in the last few days. Without wishing to walk across ground that has been heavily trodden, I can only say that it is an extraordinary -  - What would I have stepped in? Indeed. It certainly illustrates a very important point here, that Australia's interests are very much tied up with having a strong relationship with the United States. Labor is equivocal about that relationship. Even on the issue of the free trade agreement, the Labor Party has had four different positions in three months. This is a fundamental relationship for Australia. It is in Australia's interests for our jobs, for our living standards and for our security. It is a relationship about which Labor is both confused and equivocal.</DOC>

 - This government have made it clear all along that, first, we regard the issue of climate change as a serious issue that the international community needs to address on a global scale. We do regard that as a serious issue that needs to be addressed. That was our view in 1998 and that was the view I expressed, but it was not reported, to the economist conference on Tuesday.  - The second point is that it was our hope and expectation, which we have frequently articulated, that, if there were to be a successful conclusion to the Kyoto negotiations, it would be a conclusion where specific commitments to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions by the target period of 2008-12 would be made by not only Annex 1 or developed countries but also developing countries. By the way, we also made it clear that our expectation and hope was that the United States would make a commitment as well. The fact of the outcome of Kyoto so far - of course, one does not know what will happen in the future - is disappointing because, firstly, and most importantly, developing countries, particularly major emitters such as Brazil, India, China and so on, have made no commitment to stabilise their greenhouse emissions. If developing countries make no commitment to deal with this problem, then this problem - which is a global problem - will not be effectively dealt with through the Kyoto mechanism. It will of course be dealt with but not effectively dealt with. As the CSIRO has made fairly clear on a number of occasions, if we are going to achieve stability in global temperatures in the years ahead, CO2 emissions will have to be reduced by between one-half or two-thirds in order to achieve that temperature stability. Kyoto as it currently stands is likely to make a contribution to reduce greenhouse emissions by the target period 2008-12 by around one per cent. The point here is that the Kyoto mechanism has not been effective in dealing with -  - I have given the House a lot of information - including the Leader of the Opposition, whose constant interjections I can only say disappoint those of us who thought he was going to raise the standards of the House - on an important issue and have made it perfectly clear that where Kyoto currently stands is extremely disappointing in terms of the objectives that were originally set for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. He is a keen supporter of issues in his electorate. Certainly, he has been of great assistance in the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountain Authority. In fact, he came over to my office and assisted me in the signing of some 49 agreements to bring about this very significant change. As the member for Eden-Monaro said, the Snowy Mountains Scheme is one of the nation's icons. It was very fitting, in 1999, for us to proudly commemorate and celebrate the work of over 100,000 people who contributed to this scheme - particularly people from postwar Europe who came here as part of the immigration program that took place in that time. This construction was one of the most pivotal events in Australia's history. It is therefore fitting that, tomorrow, another historical event takes place.It gives me much pleasure to be able to announce that the Snowy Mountains Scheme will start a new chapter in its history tomorrow through the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, which has been a drawn out process over some 10 years. We have finally reached agreement with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Tomorrow, 28 June, we will see the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority replaced by Snowy Hydro Ltd. The scheme continues to make an important contribution to the Australian economy and is one of the largest renewable generators in mainland Australia. The launch of Snowy Hydro Ltd tomorrow will ensure the Snowy scheme continues its pre-eminence as a source of hydro-electricity and water supplies for both irrigation and environmental purposes. -  - It should not go unreported that the Commonwealth arrangements also provide for the repayment of Commonwealth loans that were used to construct the scheme. Almost $900 million will be returned to the government in the coming months. For the benefit of the member for Eden-Monaro and those in the House who can be bothered to listen, I should also mention the future prospects of Snowy Hydro Ltd and its employees. It will remain a significant regional employer, and the headquarters of the company will remain in Cooma. The almost 50 intergovernmental agreements signed between the three governments have also secured an environmental benefit to bring about a win-win solution. Not only will the irrigators in the Murray not lose a drop of water as a result of these agreements, there will be significant environmental flows to both the Murray River and the Snowy River. - Can I say in making this announcement, the most important facet of this occurrence tomorrow is that it was brought about through the cooperation of Labor Party people. But guess what! Through none of those sitting over there. No, this came about through the cooperation of John Della Bosca and Candy Broad, who have a far better approach to good government and good policy than the people who sit there.</DOC>

 - This is part of the opposition's scare campaign, drawing on a tradition of many years of opposing the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights. Any reason to cloud the true scientific and research issues surrounding this project will be seized upon by the opposition. In any event, let me provide some essential information to the House. Geotechnical consultants IGNS are presently conducting site investigations at Lucas Heights and will prepare a full report for ANSTO. The report will assess the significance of a fault discovered during excavations for the replacement research reactor. This report will be made available to the independent regulator - the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency - which will conduct a thorough review of the information, taking full account of international experience in reactor siting. ARPANSA will make all of its findings public. Site investigations during excavation of the reactor foundations were required by the chief executive of ARPANSA to identify any faults. - These investigations complement the extensive study of the seismic characteristics of the site in ANSTO's application for a construction licence for the reactor and in ARPANSA's review of that application. In other words, the independent statutory body is overseeing this aspect of the construction of the research reactor, as it has all other stages leading to this point. I am advised that, by way of preliminary investigations, faults are common geological features and usually do not signify a seismic hazard. Current geotechnical investigations will determine the significance and implications of the fault. - A senior ARPANSA officer said on ABC radio on Friday that the discovery of the fault `does not automatically mean that the site is not suitable.' It is very unfortunate that groups opposed to the research reactor would scaremonger on this issue, as has the opposition. Every precaution is being taken in regard to the construction of the reactor. It is due to the thorough nature of the process that the fault has been discovered. ANSTO is acting and will continue to act in accordance with the highest traditions of safety and not the political opportunism that is the record of the opposition. - Three times they have taken on the Liberal member for Hughes, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who three times has stood by the scientific, social and medical need for a replacement research reactor. And three times she has prevailed in the seat of Hughes and won the overwhelming endorsement of her electorate with her vote going up increasingly at each election, due in no small measure to her stand on this issue. - Contrast that with the Labor Party who, when Gareth Evans, invited by the chief executive of ANSTO to visit back in 1998, wrote a letter dated 11 March -  - The Labor Party's views on the need for, and siting of, the research reactor are entirely relevant. He said to the executive director:On the new reactor, I am afraid the realities of politics in an election year, and in particular our need to win Hughes, have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor as difficult as that may be to justify on objective safety-focused terms. I am sorry I could not have been more helpful.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. Australia is one of the most successful multicultural nations in the world, with a social cohesion which is the envy of virtually all other countries around the world. The Living in Harmony grants round for 2002-03 is now open and the purpose of this program is to promote community harmony at the local level. It is yet another example of an election promise delivered on time, on budget and in full by this government and it stands in stark contrast to the offerings from those opposite, who produced absolutely nothing at all in the most recent election campaign - no commitment to community harmony.The aim of the grants is to encourage Australians to take a stand against racism, prejudice and intolerance and to set an example for our children to practise traditional values of justice, equality, fairness and friendship. I would remind the House of the great Martin Luther King, who said, amongst many good things:Don't hate, it's too big a burden to bear. Here are four examples of funding over the last few years from this marvellous program. Last year funding went to projects such as `Living harmoniously: rural and regional' in the Townsville region - the member for Herbert's electorate; a youth anti-racism peer mentoring program in Footscray; the Australian Turkish Association's project on ethnic youth gangs at Mordialloc in Victoria; and - this is very timely, as the World Cup soccer is on at the moment - a program, developed jointly by the Australian Professional Footballers Association and the Victorian Soccer Federation, called `Australian soccer: celebrating equality and harmony', aimed at reducing intolerance in that sport and in sport in general. They developed a code of conduct for clubs, officials and players. To highlight the code they used a red card with the slogan, `Give racism the red card.' These are obviously very creative, relevant, local ideas that are backed by this government because we trust the people.I invite community organisations to consider how this funding could help them make a difference in their own communities and to apply for Living in Harmony grants by the closing date of 26 July. The guidelines for the kits are available on the Living in Harmony web site. The grants are intended for incorporated not-for-profit organisations and schools. I do not mind reminding all members in the House that political parties are not eligible. This could be unfortunate for the Australian Labor Party, which may have much need for an injection of harmony, in particular in the Werriwa branch.</DOC>

 - I recently spent two days with the member for Dawson in her electorate. It was like a honeymoon, in fact; it was fantastic. It was great visiting the islands, the Whitsunday Passage and all those great tourism operators up there - and importantly also Bowen, where the Labor mayor was very happy to see us. He thought he had an outstanding local member. He was almost prepared to change from the Labor Party to the National Party. They are pretty happy up in the member for Dawson's electorate because tourism numbers are up. There has been a five per cent increase in visitor nights in regional areas in the first three months of this year. In the member for Dawson's electorate, where 7,600 Queenslanders are employed in tourism and where tourism generates around $320 million a year in income to the electorate, tourism is vitally important and it is important that we help to keep the numbers up.The member for Dawson's small business and tourism operators raised a number of issues in relation to small business but the overwhelming issue was unfair dismissal laws. They want to be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. They said it was an impediment to further employment in the tourism industry. The member for Dawson is a great advocate for small business. She was a small business owner for many years. She has spoken in the House on behalf of local small businesses 29 times in six years. Compare that to the member for Bowman - he lurks up there in the dark shadows - who has been in here for 13 years and has mentioned small business on just six occasions. It is a 10-to-one beating from the member for Dawson, so it is no surprise that it is an important issue. It is quite clear that the Labor Party does not care about small business. The member for Rankin said:Labor needs to be relevant to them - small business - We need in the first instance to be demonstrably supportive of small business.I am looking for a small business operator in the Labor Party who really cares. In fact, I am looking for someone who supports small business. I went back to the web site of the federal member for Lyons. Mr Speaker, you will recall that I have talked about the web site for the member for Lyons previously. On his web site entry he says:As your representative in the Federal Parliament I strive to keep you up-to-date with the issues that I deal with ...This is a new site ... so please feel free to visit this site often ...To find out what I have been doing ... click on the go button.I clicked on small business and up came the menu for small business and, again, a blank page! Dick has wiped off the menu. It is the best dietary advice I have ever had. All the aspirations of Australia's 1.2 million small businesses rest in the hands of Senator Barney Cooney, who has only 24 hours left in the Senate. Of the 28 Labor senators, he is the only Labor senator who has ever worked in small business, and he has to retire in 24 hours. When the unfair dismissal law goes up to the Senate, before Senator Barney Cooney leaves they should take a DNA swab. They should jar that swab because the Labor Party will have no-one left with any small business experience in the Senate. When it comes to a crucial bill for Australia's small businesses, when it comes to a crucial vote about creating more jobs for Australia's small businesses, there will not be one Labor senator who has ever worked in a small business or been associated with a small business. That vote is vitally important because it creates jobs. We are about jobs in the Liberal and National Parties. The Labor Party is opposed to job creation and it is opposed to small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have had the opportunity to read Brent Scowcroft's article, and I think that, at the end of the day, these are balance of judgment arguments about a hypothetical proposition. The important thing to understand here is that, first of all, the international community, including the United States, needs to maintain as much pressure as it possibly can on Iraq to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to allow in United Nations inspectors from UNMOVIC to ensure that all weapons of mass destruction capabilities within Iraq are destroyed. The task at the moment is to make sure that everything is done to achieve that.If the United States eventually comes to a conclusion that it has no alternative but to take military action - and that is, of course, a hypothetical proposition - and when that time comes, if it ever does come, then I do not doubt that the sorts of issues that Mr Scowcroft and others who have been participating in this debate have raised will be taken into account. But obviously, at the end of the day, these issues are always difficult issues and always boil down to a very complex balance of judgment, and the judgment about a question of going to war would be one that no doubt the United States administration, in particular the President, would weigh very heavily. No doubt there would be substantial consultations with allies. All of this, if that situation were to arise, would arise in circumstances where it was perfectly clear that United Nations efforts, which are still going on, would irretrievably have broken down - there is no question of that. Today, in August 2002, efforts are still being made fervently by UNMOVIC, the United Nations agency which is responsible for the inspections in Iraq, and by the Secretary-General himself, so we wish them well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for that question. It is appropriate that a question on this matter should be asked by a Western Australian member of the House of Representatives. The decision to award this very important contract to the Australian consortium is a major trade milestone for this country. It is the largest single trade deal ever entered into by Australia. It is a major win for Australia's energy industry and also for a combined Australian commercial and diplomatic effort.I would like to pay tribute not only to the leaders of the companies but also to the pioneering work carried out by Richard Court, the former Premier of Western Australia. Also let me compliment the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Gallop, on his contribution. Can I say that, in the 6½ years I have been Prime Minister, I have seen no better diplomatic effort than that carried out by our ambassador in Beijing, David Irvine. I do want to record my thanks to him. I took the opportunity, after the news came through, to telephone him and thank him very warmly. I want to record in this parliament that this country is served very well in many of its sensitive posts by high-quality diplomats, and David Irvine is certainly one of them. The work that he did on this was quite extraordinary.May I also thank the Leader of the Opposition for the support that he gave to the project, and also, while I am in this kind of mood, can I thank the former Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, who visited China in connection with the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and the People's Republic. This outcome highlights the maturity of Australia's bilateral relationship with China. It demonstrates the capacity of this country in the early years of the 21st century to have a close relationship with nations that in other respects are very different one from the other.Australia's exports to China nearly doubled to $7.6 billion in 2001, since the government was elected. China is now our fourth largest export market and our third largest trading partner. It is not just trade which has been a mark of the maturing of that relationship: it has been in many other respects as well. It also highlights the importance, when dealing with countries such as China, of high-level political contact. I have no doubt that the high-level political contact between me and the Premier and the President of China were elements in the decision that was finally taken. But in the end you do not win a commercial contract unless you have a good product at the right price, and the Australian companies and the other companies that put together this bid deserve our congratulations. It is something that all Australians can feel pleased about. It will be important in underwriting the future strengths of the commercial relationship between Australia and China. It is a reminder to those who would argue otherwise that this country has a mature and full capacity to relate to major powers in all parts of the world, and suggestions that this country under this government has downgraded our relations with China, or indeed with any other part of the Asia-Pacific region, are what they have always been - completely unfounded allegations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate his interest and the consideration in asking that question. There are lots of different views that have been expressed in the United States. I do not want to set myself up as a commentator on every view that has been expressed by every person in the United States, but I noticed, in my case in quite some detail, quite a lively debate in the United States expressing different views about this whole question of Iraq. I repeat what I said in answer to the previous question: of course the President of the United States has not yet made - if he ever will make - a decision to take military action against Iraq. The United States have said that they do not have a plan on the President's desk at the moment, but obviously the President and the administration are deeply concerned - and I think rightly deeply concerned - about not only Iraq's refusal to accept its obligations under the United Nations Security Council resolutions by denying access to Iraq by United Nations inspectors but also about weapons of mass destruction capability in Iraq, and particularly chemical and biological weapons.The other issue that I know is of great concern in the United States is that Iraq, it is said, provides support to terrorist organisations operating through the Palestinian territories into Israel. It is believed that the Iraqi administration provides $US25,000 to the families of suicide bombers who kill Israelis in places such as discotheques, shopping centres, restaurants and so on, and obviously that is a matter of enormous concern as well.I think the point here is that this is an extremely serious issue because of Iraq's record, the capabilities of Iraq and its defiance of the international community. In those circumstances obviously in the United States there will be a good deal of discussion over the next few months about what the United States could or could not do in the event of diplomacy breaking down. Everybody hopes that the efforts of the United Nations, the Security Council, UNMOVIC and the Secretary-General will be successful, but it is hard to know whether they will be because the record of the relationship between the regime in Iraq and United Nations inspectors has not been a happy one. As members will recall, Richard Butler - very well known on the other side of the House particularly - was the chairman of the United Nations special commission responsible for inspections in Iraq. His inspection regime ultimately foundered in 1998 on the grounds that UNSCOM - Mr Butler and UNSCOM generally - were unable to fulfil their obligations under Security Council resolutions. I really do not have anything more to add to that. It is an issue that in the context of the United States will be debated, and we will see what happens over time. If United Nations diplomacy finally fails, I suppose in those circumstances the debate will take on a different nature.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his significant interest in the activities of the Australian Wheat Board and their success in their export effort on behalf of Australian wheat farmers, a lot of whom are in his electorate. In response to the question, I can inform the House that over the weekend the Australian Wheat Board and the Iraqi Grains Board reached a successful outcome in the quarantine dispute over Australian wheat exports to Iraq. Members would be aware that there was a dispute over an alleged contamination issue, and a question about the quality of a number of shiploads of wheat en route to Iraq waiting to be unloaded. That issue has been resolved, which is excellent news for the Australian Wheat Board and for Australian wheat farmers and their families.The outcome that has been achieved with Iraq has certainly vindicated the federal government's faith in the AWB and its ability to successfully manage its commercial dealings with the Iraqi Grains Board. Historically, Australia has exported around two million tonnes of wheat per year under the United Nations oil for food program. This latest outcome means that Australian wheat farmers will have sold almost 1.8 million tonnes of quality Australian wheat to Iraq this year, only some 200,000 tonnes short of what accurately gets recorded as wheat exports to Iraq each year.I take this opportunity to inform the House - on top of the good news that broke yesterday - that the Australian Wheat Board has also recently secured an order for a further 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to Jordan, the first order since 1996. More importantly, following the recent trade delegation that I led to Libya, which included the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, the Wheat Board has secured an order for 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Libya. That is a result of that visit in the last month to Libya. Those two new orders are worth roughly $A25 million. These announcements vindicate our government's support of the Australian Wheat Board in its efforts to successfully manage those commercial dealings with the Iraqi Grains Board, and in working to open up much needed new markets for the Australian wheat farming community.</DOC>

 - I do not know that I have a great deal to add to the answers to the two previous questions which were about statements made by Americans. There are different points of view being put in the United States on this issue, some by Democrats who disagree with each other, some by Republicans who disagree with each other. I suppose ultimately the policy of the United States will be determined by the United States administration, made up obviously first and foremost by the President himself and by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser. They have all expressed views of one sort or another on this issue as well - many have in recent times. We look forward to hearing all sorts of different views coming out of the United States.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. Global economic conditions remain weak, and there are increasing risks to the outlook. The United States continues to record slow economic growth, expanding at nearly 0.3 per cent in the June quarter. Growth in Europe is subdued, with the German, French and Italian economies recording little or no growth. The Japanese economy remains in recession, contracting by 1.6 per cent in the year to March 2000. Since the House last met, there has been enormous volatility on international markets. The Dow Jones industrial index is now around 25 per cent below the peak that it reached in January 2000. In Europe and Asia markets are around 30 per cent below their peak. The risk in those countries is if the financial market volatility and the equity market volatility were to feed back into the real economy, bruising consumer and business confidence.The Australian economy, however, continues to grow, notwithstanding the fact that the drought appears to be worsening, with some 82 per cent of New South Wales drought declared, with a further 10 per cent at risk, and 16 per cent of Queensland also drought declared. There is now a serious situation developing in rural Australia which will impact on domestic growth here. Notwithstanding that, retail trade increased a very strong 6.3 per cent over the year. Dwelling investment appears to be holding up. Whilst there is some softening, in today's ACCI small business barometer conditions appear to be stronger than they were around 12 months ago. No doubt the weak international situation is now feeding back into businesses' perceptions in relation to prospects for the forthcoming year.The recent Economist averages poll forecasts Australia to be the strongest growing economy in the developed world in both 2002 and 2003. Australia's prospects will be affected by developments overseas, but we are able to cope with developments overseas because of important economic reforms - including the reform of the taxation system, which has taken taxes off our exports and given our exporters a fairer go on world and international markets. More needs to be done. More needs to be done on fiscal policy, where the government's budget measures should be passed by the Senate. More needs to be done in relation to international tax reform, and the government will shortly announce a program in relation to that. More needs to be done in relation to labour market reform. If there is one thing that could have direct and immediate impact in this country on improving Australia's economic prospects and the prospects of tens of thousands of small businesses throughout Australia, it is labour market reform. If the Senate would anticipate and hear the cries of small business in Australia in relation to unfair dismissal laws and other labour market reform, this would be a great development for Australia. We appeal for some responsibility from the Australian Labor Party in relation to those measures, which could make the Australian economy stronger.</DOC>

 - I do not have the transcript of the interview with me, but the critical issue is Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction. Without trying to recall exactly the details of that interview, my point is that that is the central question. That is why this is a very grave and very serious issue. Anybody who understands the economics, the politics and the geopolitics of the Middle East, and in particular Iraq, and anyone who has a good understanding of the modern history of Iraq and of the behaviour of the government in Iraq knows that the possession by Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, of chemical and biological weapons and possibly Iraq developing yet again a nuclear weapons program - of course, they originally worked on a nuclear weapons program and there is some debate about whether or not they are, but assuming that they are - is the central issue. Questions about what would happen if the Americans launched a military strike against Iraq are questions very much about the details of military tactics and military strategy. There are a lot of different ways that action could be taken against another country if a decision were made to take that action.For me, there is no doubt about it. I think this whole question of weapons of mass destruction is a profoundly serious and a profoundly important issue. So seriously has this government taken this issue - and, by the way, I think the previous government took it very seriously as well; to be fair, my predecessor took that issue very seriously - that I as the foreign minister and the government took to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We got the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and that treaty is one of the benchmarks in the world for nuclear non-proliferation. The possession of weapons of mass destruction is an enormous issue, particularly the possession of those weapons by an administration which has, as has been said on many occasions, used those weapons. It used them against Iran in 1984. Ironically, for the purposes of this discussion, it was after the use of those weapons of mass destruction against the Iranians - and I think something like 5,000 Iranians were killed on that occasion by chemical weapons - that the Australia group was established. It was designed to stop the trade in precursors for those types of weapons where it was felt that trade existed. Iraq has used chemical weapons against its own population, as I know the House is well aware. That is the central and most serious issue. Hypothetical questions about what might and might not happen in a war and so on are questions for military tacticians. If Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, it could not use them. That is the central issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and place on record my appreciation - and I think that of all who depend on Kendell and Hazelton, as they were, for their aviation services - for the work that she put into securing their future over what has been a very difficult nine or 10 months. I am delighted to be able to report to the House that, after a very difficult period in regional aviation, on 6 August I was able to help launch a new airline, Regional Express, which will fly to some 30 towns and centres across eastern Australia with a total of almost 1,300 flights weekly, operating a fleet of Saabs and Metro 23s. The new airline will be known as Rex, short for Regional Express. I know that the towns that they service are delighted to have a future for those airlines and for their services. I know, though, that no-one is more delighted than the very good people who work for those two smaller airlines, Kendell and Hazelton, now combined as Rex.The government sought to play an active role in this. We extended the Hazelton deed of company arrangement in a way that prevented premature liquidation. Indeed, I commented a couple of times that, in this case, it was agonisingly slow - but better a slow deal than no deal. We also provided some $5 million to the new outfit, having already provided substantial financial resourcing to Hazelton and Kendell while they were in administration, because of our commitment to services in regional areas. The grant that we have made is conditional upon that new airline maintaining services to centres previously served only by Kendell or Hazelton in the past. Nonetheless, I am delighted that we have made this progress and indeed also glad to acknowledge that the CEO of Rex, Mr Michael Jones, has publicly stated that, without the government's support, there would have been no sale.While on matters of aviation, and in stark contrast to the support that we have provided for regional aviation, I do want to take this opportunity to roundly condemn today's strike action by the Australian Services Union, which will disrupt hundreds of Qantas flights today and further destabilise an industry that is just beginning to find its feet and, in particular, help service those industries that are still seeking to recover from the upsets of last year, including September 11. Most of all, that involves the tourism industry. The tourism industry is just beginning to get its numbers back again. I would have thought this sort of action by members of the Australian Services Union is unwise in terms of its impact not only on the aviation sector but also on the jobs that the tourism industry provides. I do call on the member for Batman and the Leader of the Opposition to join with me in condemning this irresponsible action, to provide a bit of leadership and distance themselves from this union action, because it is not in the interests of the people who work for Qantas or the 500,000 or so Australian jobs that depend on tourism.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The request that was made of me by the Leader of the Opposition was that I should make a full parliamentary statement within the next two weeks. It is that request that I rejected. The Leader of the Opposition might have acknowledged in more precise terms what his request was, and then I would have acknowledged in equally precise terms what my response was. For the benefit of the House, let me read some excerpts from the response I gave to the Leader of the Opposition. I said this:I have your letter of the 16th of August requesting a parliamentary statement on Iraq and raising the expectation that it might be made by me in the next two sitting weeks of parliament.I responded that I thought a full statement of the type he requested within this period of two weeks would, for the reasons I set out, be premature. I did go on to say this:The government has every intention of fully involving the parliament in this matter. Whilst, for the reasons given, a parliamentary statement of the type you have sought is premature at this time, the evolving character of the issue means that the parliamentary handling of the situation will be kept under constant review by the government.What that means, if I can just take the narrative on a little, is clearly that, if a decision were made - and it is quite hypothetical - to commit Australian armed forces, then of course that matter would be brought before the parliament, but that does not preclude the possibility of there being parliamentary debate on this issue in advance of any decision. I have not sought at any time to rule that out. What I did rule out was any statement being made in the next two weeks. I made that very clear, for the reasons I explained in my letter. If the Leader of the Opposition had read the letter carefully, he would have seen - surely - the second last paragraph, and he surely would have acknowledged that what I was simply doing, for very good reason, was ruling out a full parliamentary statement in the next two weeks because plainly that would be premature. No decision has been taken by the United States. The debate in the United States is underway. I do not believe any decision will be taken by the United States either way within the weeks immediately ahead. I have said that, if the Americans were to take a decision to take action, I believe it likely that they would approach Australia for assistance. It would then be for the Australian government to consider the matter in accordance with the normal constitutional processes. I might remind the House of some words used by Mr Hawke when he was Prime Minister, when he moved a motion committing Australian forces to the Desert Storm operation on 21 January 1991. What he said was this:The decision to commit Australian armed forces to combat is of course one that constitutionally is the prerogative of the Executive.Now they are not words I have used; they are words that the former Prime Minister of Australia used on that particular occasion. I would expect if - and I underline the word `if' - a decision were taken to commit any Australian forces consequent upon an American request, and it would be a decision only taken by this government if we thought it to be in the national interest to do so and we would want to be completely satisfied that it was in the national interest to do so, then I would follow the same procedure that was followed by Mr Hawke on that occasion, and the procedure that was followed by me as Prime Minister when a decision was taken to commit forces to East Timor.In the time I have been Prime Minister this country has committed military forces to significant combats on two occasions: one to East Timor and one to the war against terror. In relation to East Timor, I kept the then Leader of the Opposition fully informed. I stand ready to continue keeping the current Leader of the Opposition fully informed. I have always taken the view that the most serious thing any government does is to commit military forces to a conflict, and I would want, as far as humanly possible, to achieve bipartisanship in relation to any decision this government ever takes to commit military forces. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if there is any further information he wants of me, he only has to come and see me and I am happy to make it available. Intelligence briefings have been made available. They will continue to be made available in accordance with the conventions that operate between government and opposition.We do have an opportunity, because of our alliance with the United States, to have an understanding of American thinking, particularly the military. We have personnel placed within the US command structure and we have had them there since the start of the war against terrorism. One of the advantages of that is that we are able to have a knowledge of the thoughts of the American military not only in relation to existing contributions but also in relation to future contributions that the American military might make to the pursuit of American foreign policy objectives.It is no secret that the United States military is probably looking at options in relation to Iraq. But it is equally no secret that the administration is far from taking any decision about this. When it will reach that conclusion I do not know, and I suspect at this stage the American administration does not know. But we will be in a position to be as abreast of their thinking as probably any country in the world and will therefore be in a position to take a very informed decision if we were to receive a request. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that I will, as far as it is possible to do consonant with my own constitutional responsibilities, inform him and include him. I did that in relation to Timor with the member for Brand when he was Leader of the Opposition and I did it in relation to the war against terror.This is a difficult situation. Nobody wants military conflict. Nobody in this House wants to see Australian forces ever sent abroad again, certainly not sent unnecessarily, if that can be avoided. Nobody wants war - we all hate it. And nobody has a monopoly on the detestation of military conflict. We ought to put that aside once and for all. I certainly deplore it, and all members of my government do, as I am sure all members sitting opposite do. But there are always occasions when some kind of military action becomes unavoidable. I hope that does not arise on this occasion.I can say - I hope without any contradiction from anybody in the House - that the one thing that would transform this situation overnight would be a willingness by Iraq to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. That is the kernel of the problem. That is the clear, unambiguous reason for the difficulty: that Iraq continues not to comply. If Iraq were to comply, overnight this situation would be transformed. That is the government's position. What I have said to the Leader of the Opposition - and I repeat it - is that it is not appropriate and it is entirely premature to seek to have a full parliamentary statement from me on this issue in the next two weeks. That does not preclude statements further down the line in advance of any - what is still, of course, completely hypothetical - commitment of Australian forces.I simply repeat something else I said in my letter to the Leader of the Opposition, and that is that I am available each day, as is my wont, to answer questions; as is the defence minister, as is the foreign minister. The normal processes of parliament will continue. I think we all hope that military conflict can be avoided; but I think that we are all instructed by history that, despite our hopes and aspirations, on occasions sometimes they are not realised. And I am sure that the parliament will have the responsibility to exercise good judgment on this issue, if that were to happen, as it has in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. Let me make it very clear that this government believes that there should be no strikes without secret ballots first. That is our position, and we believe that that position is utterly in the national interest. Strikes cost jobs, strikes damage Australian companies and strikes hurt Australia's reputation abroad. The real victims of strikes are invariably rank and file shopfloor workers, who risk losing hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars out of their pockets to satisfy the political agendas of union officials whose pay packets are not at risk. Secret ballots are supported by the German socialist government. They are supported by the British Labour government. Secret ballots have been supported by the Beattie Labor government in Queensland. Secret ballots should be supported by this parliament and I call on the Senate to support the government's secret ballots legislation.When the Beattie government faced a serious run of industrial disputation by nurses in Queensland, what did Premier Beattie do? He called for a secret ballot of those nurses. That is what he wanted - until he was monstered by big Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers Union. If Bill Ludwig can intimidate the Queensland Premier, all the more reason why ordinary workers should get secret ballots, so they are not intimidated by union heavies. Bill Ludwig said, `Secret ballots in the labour movement are abhorrent.' It is hardly surprising that, when Steve Martin quit - because the Leader of the Opposition had squibbed party reform - there was no secret ballot of the rank and file members of the party. The matter is being dealt with by the administrative committee of the New South Wales Labor Party - the modern faceless men. - On the topic of secret ballots, the behaviour of members opposite in the seat of Cunningham demonstrates that they use the rank and file; they never listen to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. Can I say that I have put aside what I regard as his completely unreasonable comments about the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Let me go to the question the Leader of the Opposition asked. I would have thought that it was a common understanding of members of this parliament that there are significant differences between our constitutional system and America's. Our system, in a situation like this, makes senior members of our government far more accountable to the parliament far more immediately than is the case in America. President Bush is not questioned by the Democrat leader in the Senate or the House of Representatives. Indeed it is my understanding that, at the congressional committee hearings that were held in the United States, no members of the administration appeared. Further, it is my understanding that senior members of both the defence department and the state department were prevented from appearing. There will be plenty of opportunity for debate on this issue. - Of course there will be opportunity for debate in parliament - plenty of opportunity. I simply remind the opposition leader that he asked me to make a full statement in the next two weeks. He will have to acknowledge, if he is in the spirit of the refreshing candour on the subject -  - Mr Speaker, this is a serious issue. I have paid the Leader of the Opposition total courtesy. I would like to point out to the parliament that the Leader of the Opposition asked for a full statement in the next two weeks. He then implied that if that did not happen there would perhaps be some move to establish a parliamentary inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition and those whom he leads, both here and in the Senate, will do what they choose in relation to the committee procedures of the parliament, but I would have thought that, at this stage, such action would fairly be seen as political rather than in the national interest.Let me simply say that I am available to answer questions. There will be a full parliamentary debate if any decision were made. I have also, both in this answer and in earlier answers, not ruled out having both statements and other debate. But I simply repeat that to make a parliamentary statement within the next two weeks is entirely premature, in my view. If we are interested, as the Leader of the Opposition professes to be, in a serious examination of this issue, I do not think that is gained by a purported full statement within the next two weeks. But I can assure him that the procedures that I follow in relation to this matter if ultimately military action were to involve Australia will be no less respectful of the constitutional processes of government in this country and the processes of the parliament than the approach adopted by former Labor Prime Minister Hawke.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question, and I acknowledge the very significant contribution that he makes to the government's consideration of environmental issues. Global warming has the capacity to inflict very significant costs on Australia. While Australia contributes about only one per cent of global emissions, the government is determined to put in place effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The Kyoto protocol, under present circumstances, unfortunately fails to provide the framework for an effective global response and promises to deliver only some one per cent emissions abatement over the commitment period of the protocol. By the end of this century, the globe will need greenhouse gas abatement of some 50 to 60 per cent, and that is why Australia is looking beyond Kyoto already. But, first of all, we will be aiming to reach the target we agreed at Kyoto of 108 per cent of 1990 emissions.The government to date has committed some $1 billion to abating greenhouse gas emissions, and I am very pleased to say that these measures are proving to be exceedingly effective. Indeed, they are estimated to produce an abatement of some 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, the equivalent of taking every passenger car off the road and removing the emissions from those vehicles. This abatement is an 11 per cent reduction in business as usual projections for 2010 and has already helped to put us within striking distance of our target.The government's measures are already beginning to decouple economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. Over the decade to come, greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP are estimated to decline by some 43 per cent. The government will be holding discussions with all parts of the Australian community, including industry, to determine the most cost effective means of achieving the further three per cent reduction in emissions that we require in order to reach our target. We will also be continuing to work for an effective global response, because combating climate change is a matter not just for Australia but for all the nations on earth.As the Australian said very sensibly in its editorial this morning:A sensible international agreement on global warming is needed, but Kyoto is not the answer.Kyoto does not include the developing countries. Kyoto does not include the United States. It is very regrettable that the opposition has taken the attitude, as it usually does, that, if there is a treaty, then sign it, regardless of whether or not it is going to be effective, and regardless of whether or not it is going to disadvantage Australian industry and impose a cost on jobs.This government will not ratify any treaty unless it is in Australia's national interest and in the interests of the strength and competitiveness of Australia's economy. This is much more obvious to the CFMEU, which strongly opposes ratification of the treaty, than it is to the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party has absolutely no idea on greenhouse. It has nothing to say about greenhouse. It did not have anything to do with greenhouse when in government. It has done nothing in opposition to give it any credibility whatsoever, whereas this government's actions are constantly looking to help position Australia and the world for an effective global attack.I might just mention the greenhouse impact of the government's latest contract with China - the $25 billion contract on LNG. This contract will have the effect of lifting Australia's greenhouse emissions by 1.5 million tonnes a year but abating China's emissions by seven million tonnes a year, which is a very significant contribution to global greenhouse gas abatement. The opposition simply takes the very easy route of saying, `Sign up and everything will be right. Sign up to the treaty and we'll solve the problem.' The Australian community knows differently. The Australian community knows that it takes hard work, and this government's measures are actually achieving what Australia's responsible international commitments require.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I do not think expensing of options was thought of by Labor. It is one of a number of issues that is under consideration by the government. There are a number of things that ought to be said about the general field covered by the Leader of the Opposition's question. I think some executive remuneration packages in recent years have been outrageously generous. This has been particularly the case with companies that have got into financial difficulty. I have said before that nothing sticks in the craw of an Australian more than witnessing a company going down the drain and the former managing director or chief financial officer or whatever walking away with not only very generous remuneration but also a very big package. I can think of a couple of spectacular examples of that in recent times. It is one of the areas that needs to be addressed. I think it is also very important that, in the process of doing this, we do not make it impossible for companies to pay what is necessary to attract the best managing directors. This country will pay a very heavy price if we do that. My view on this is that we should not be stampeded into dumping a whole lot of extra regulation on honest business men and women just for the sake of appearing a bit Rambo on the subject. I thought appearing Rambo on anything was certainly undesirable in the eyes of the opposition. The opposition, of course, is no doubt riding a little bit off what has happened in the United States. I encourage the Leader of the Opposition not to draw too many parallels between Australia and the United States. To start with, in the United States the positions of company chairman and managing director are often confused; they are often one and the same person. There are different accounting procedures. The Americans have a far more black letter law approach. The philosophy in the United States is: `Show me the words that say I can't do it,' rather than encouraging a more principles based approach, which has been the case in Australia. I think the great bulk of men and women who run companies in this country are honest, ethical people. I do not share the negative view of them peddled by the Leader of the Opposition. We will make changes that are necessary. We will certainly wait until we get the report of the HIH royal commission. It is a very important report. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, we are carrying out a review of the Trade Practices Act at present and we will be interested in what Mr Justice Dawson has to say as a result of that review. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. He seeks information in relation to what has been happening to those people who have made claims for, in the main, refugee status, when they have arrived in Australia unauthorised, principally by boat. It perhaps is useful to know that at this stage, without having had any substantial boat arrivals in Australia now for some 9½ months, we are now dealing with a residue of the large number of people who had, before that time, arrived without lawful authority.Currently, there are 594 unauthorised boat arrivals in detention centres. Of those, only four have not received a primary decision. In relation to those four, it is because of unresolved character and security issues, on which I assume no-one would want us to compromise. There are 263 who are before the courts challenging decisions in relation to refusal by the department and the Refugee Review Tribunal to grant them a visa. There are 283 who have exhausted all appeals and are awaiting removal. I looked at the figures in greater detail: there were 24 who were still before the Refugee Review Tribunal, and I saw in a letter the chairman of the tribunal gave me today that the average finalisation time for the tribunal has been 66 days, which is the same period that it took in the previous year to finalise decisions.In other words, if you look at the system that is in place, primary processing and appeals before the administrative body, the Refugee Review Tribunal, occur quite quickly in the main - not always, but quite quickly in the main. The reason people are detained, and detained for any period of time, is that they want to test to the limits their entitlements in our system as it operates. That does mean that some people have been able to take matters before the courts for a first-tier decision, a second-tier decision before a full court, and the High Court of Australia, and in some cases we even have people applying to international bodies, complaining that they should not be removed after all of that decision making has taken place.There are the larger group of people who are awaiting removal. People say, `Why haven't they gone?' The principal reason is that some countries persist with a view that, even in relation to their nationals, they should be volunteers in coming back. I hope that that can be addressed fairly shortly, but there have been countries that have taken that view. It has certainly been the case in relation to the Afghans - where a package has been offered to encourage them to go back - that it has been foreshadowed that removal might be possible later but it is not encouraged at this time. So there are those sorts of situations, but nobody is stopped from going. If they wish to leave, they can leave at any time. - Let me make the point that in relation to these matters it is very rare for there ever to be a circumstance in which a person cannot make arrangements to go. In relation to those cases, we believe in time that the arrangements can be made. I am not prepared to accept that - even in relation to the case in which there was a decision last week - given time, a country would not come to an arrangement with us to obtain transit rights for somebody to be able to go home. But let me make it very clear: I am not beyond intervening in such cases where detention would become arbitrary. The important point is that we are not being capricious in relation to these matters. We are in a situation where those people detained in Australia today are not refugees. In the main, they are readily able to go home and, in our view, in almost all cases will be able to go home. That is a system which ought not to be undermined by people taking the view: `It has all become too hard. Just open the doors and let people go.' Inevitably, if you have had a system to determine whether or not people are refugees and if you were to undermine the credibility of it, you would simply be encouraging people to get into boats again. Our process has been creditable, it has been fair and it has been just. It is one which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has tried to encourage other countries to adopt. I know that many are not prepared to, having looked at the way in which it operates here, particularly in terms of timeliness in finalising these matters. I wish to conclude by saying that, if you want to look at what happens if you compromise in relation to these matters, you need look no further than what has been happening in Europe. In France, 95 per cent of asylum seekers who have been released into the community and who await processing of their claims fail to report when those claims have been processed. In the United States, 89 per cent of people who are the subject of orders to surrender for removal fail to surrender. Even here - and I think we have been particularly effective in relation to those people who are in the community and whose claims are being assessed, and we have been more effective than the European experience - something like 40 per cent of those people who are rejected remain in Australia. As we have seen in some other litigation in relation to class actions recently, very large numbers of them use legal proceedings to obtain bridging visas and to maintain themselves in the Australian community. I say to those members of the Labor Party who from time to time feign an interest in the unemployed that, in relation to these matters, our experience has been that most people who are unlawful in the Australian community and who use these systems to remain lawful, even though they may not be entitled to obtain work, inevitably are in work and are taking jobs from those who are least able to get them in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thought the basis of the earlier question was a request that the options be expensed. I think in your question just now you asked me why they are not disclosed. The reality is that they are disclosed. - It does not mean that at all. -  - For the benefit of the opposition leader, I point out that the Corporations Act requires that the details of the options granted as part of the remuneration of directors and the five most highly remunerated officers of a company be disclosed in the directors' report. Expensing, as I understand it, is a reference to the inclusion in the accounts of a company. So the Leader of the Opposition's first question was right. His second question was different from his first question and therefore wrong. My first answer stands. The answer to the most recent question is: it is already required. If the Leader of the Opposition had an elementary understanding of the law, he would not have asked the last question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon, who I spent a bit of time with over the break. We visited the Mary River and were down at the Corroboree Billabong. We met some small business and tourism constituents of his and other constituents. As the member for Solomon well knows, the tourism industry has been doing it tough -  - since both September 11 and September 14. I will come to you over there in a moment. The industry has been doing it tough for a number of reasons: obviously, the collapse of Ansett had quite a significant impact, particularly on domestic tourism; and perhaps just as significantly, particularly for Darwin, the decline in the number of international services in various parts of Australia. So the tourism industry has been doing it tough and will continue to do it tough in volatile times.Aviation is obviously key infrastructure for the tourism industry. International operators expect a reliable aviation service. They also expect regular servicing and they expect regular services. They will be profoundly disappointed by the action of the Australian Services Union today in holding a strike. Qantas now represents over 80 per cent of the domestic tourism industry in Australia in terms of aviation services. So when there is a strike at Qantas, it is not just a strike against one company - it is a strike against the entire aviation industry; it is a strike against coach operators; it is a strike against taxi drivers; it is a strike against bed and breakfasts, motels and hotels. A strike held at Qantas by the ASU should be condemned by all parties, not just on this side of the House and not just by the travelling public but by the Labor Party as well. We fully expect the Labor Party to support us in condemning the Australian Services Union for their bloody-minded action in holding a strike today. We look forward to the Leader of the Opposition calling the head of the ASU and saying, `Listen, comrade, we want to get people around the country. We want to support the tourism industry. We want to support all those small businesses. Comrade, can you get back to work?'I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will not take into account the fact that the Australian Services Union has donated $1.3 million to the Labor Party since 1996. That will have no bearing whatsoever on his communication with the ASU. It will have no bearing whatsoever on the thoughts of the Leader of the Opposition that five members of the Labor caucus here are members of the ASU. That will have no bearing at all. The member for Lalor will be ringing the ASU and asking them to go back to work. The member for Bruce, the member for Burke, the member for Chifley, the member for Melbourne -  - We condemn the Australian Services Union for calling this strike today; we condemn them for inconveniencing tens of thousands of Australian travellers; and we condemn them for holding the Australian travelling public to ransom.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. I cannot provide the detail of the information that he would like me to provide, but I will, consistent with the practice of successive governments, advise of what I can. There is a scheme of some longstanding - Financial Assistance for Legal Costs before Royal Commissions - and it applies in respect of both the HIH commission and the building and construction industry commission at the moment. It has been established to enable all people who have a central role in the proceedings to have access to legal representation, and to assist the royal commissions in their tasks. Applications for financial assistance are carefully assessed to ensure that public funds are provided to those people who have a central role in the royal commission, are likely to be prejudiced by the proceedings or where cross-examination of the individual is likely to assist the commission in its task. Applications are assessed to determine whether it would be reasonable for assistance to be provided and, if so, on what conditions.This assessment ensures that limited public funds are spent in the most efficient and effective manner. In some cases, the applicants pay the costs themselves or some of the costs themselves. This scheme of assistance is not means tested; it has been established to ensure that royal commissions can effectively report to the government. Given the coercive powers of a royal commission, it is considered appropriate that people appearing before it should be adequately represented. As far as individual applicants for assistance are concerned, there is a longstanding practice, endorsed by successive holders of my office, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence. This practice extends to neither confirming nor denying that particular applications have been received. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to provide information in relation to the names of the persons mentioned by the member for Barton.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I had the opportunity in recent weeks and months to address an aged care forum in Colac in his electorate and also to participate in a roundtable for aged care providers in Geelong, in part of his electorate.This year's budget contains a significant investment of some $47.5 million in Australia's aged care work force. This includes an amount of $26.3 million over four years to fund up to 1,000 nursing scholarships, commencing with 250 scholarships next year. These scholarships will be an important component of the aged care work force in coming years. They are particularly directed at those who would work in the aged care work force in rural and regional Australia. They will be valued at up to $10,000 each. In addition to that, there is a further $21 million over four years to fund training of aged care staff in smaller aged care homes, and this will provide necessary skills and training for some 10,000 aged care workers throughout Australia. This comes on top of the delivery of $211 million in additional recurrent funding, the first $51 million of which flowed from 1 July this year to the aged care sector, and also on top of ongoing work on an aged care work force strategy, looking at the current and future work force needs of aged care in Australia.In addition to that, the government is working on a report on the recruitment and retention of nurses in residential aged care and on some ongoing work to simplify and decrease the burden of paperwork under the resident classification scale, and there is a national review of nursing education which has examined the education and training issues of nurses at a national and professional level. In addition to that, over the next 12 months the government will carry out an inquiry into the underlying pricing issues in aged care to ensure that we have an efficient and viable aged care sector into the future.This stands in contrast to Labor's confusion on the issue. On the one hand, we have the member for Grayndler issuing press releases from time to time, talking about an aged care crisis. On the other hand, I was surprised to read just a week or so ago that he says he does not subscribe to such a doomsday scenario about an ageing crisis. It is just another example of one message for one audience and another for another. No wonder Noel Pearson described the member for Grayndler as an example of the progressivist confusion of the latte Left.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the government did receive the report at approximately the time the member for Barton mentioned. Since then, there has been considerable work done on what are some very complex issues. The task force was originally appointed by the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp, and me. It comprised representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, Treasury, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. The most difficult issues raised by the report relate to the availability of taxation information. It is that that has meant that the report has not yet been responded to. We are working very hard on it - in fact, I spoke to Senator Coonan only last week about the government response, and we hope to see one very soon.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I am aware of a recent report - the report of the Hawke-Wran review - which, naturally enough, wants to take Australia back to the good old days of the 1980s when the ACTU was more important than the federal cabinet. Not surprisingly, Greg Combet, the ACTU Secretary, says, `I am very pleased with the overall thrust of it.' That is not surprising because, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, there has been a secret deal. - That is right, Mr Speaker, and this report wants to make registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act much more powerful than at present. Under the Hawke-Wran report, union representation might drop from 60 per cent to 50 per cent at state conferences but it will increase from zero per cent to 50 per cent at the national Labor Party conference. - The real problem is that it is not the 60 per cent rule or the 50 per cent rule; it is the 100 per cent rule, as the member for Hunter well knows, because the member for Hunter -  - As the member for Hunter said, the problem is the 100 per cent rule; the rule that gives members of registered organisations under the Workplace Relations Act 100 per cent control over the membership of the Australian Labor Party. For instance, the member for Hunter quotes rule 5AB of the New South Wales party -  - Mr Speaker, the Workplace Relations Act is my portfolio responsibility and it regulates the affairs of trade unions. In turn, trade unions have 100 per cent control over the Australian Labor Party, a control that they are tremendously embarrassed about. As the member for Hunter has pointed out, the New South Wales Labor rules say:No-one will be allowed to join or remain a member unless he or she is a paid-up member of the union covering his or her work.The next rule goes on to say -  - Mr Speaker, I do represent in this House the Special Minister of State, so I am very happy to talk about the role of the Electoral Act. But the fact is 60-40, 50-50 - what does it matter? The only thing that counts is full internal democracy - one vote, one value - and that is the one thing that the Leader of the Opposition will never deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question. He is asking about family tax benefit, which has been a great achievement for this government. Why is that? It is because this government has put in an extra $2 billion, which went to two million Australian families to assist 3.5 million children. That increase in family tax benefit which, on average, is around $5,700 - including the child-care benefit, which averages about $1,800 - has meant that Australian families are now significantly better off because of the changes that we made to the family tax benefit. Last year, with the introduction of the family tax benefit, a decision was made that, as a transitional arrangement, particularly in the first year, a waiver would be put into place. This was to assist Australian families in that adjustment process. It was a very generous waiver of around $1,000 for both family tax benefit and for child-care benefit. It has always been the intent of the government that it is important that Australian families get their correct entitlements - no more, no less. Part of that is ensuring that they get an accurate estimation. With family tax benefit, we decided that families could have three options. They could receive it as a fortnightly repayment. They could receive it at the end of the year, which would be their top-up payment. That is the first time ever, I might add, that Australian families could receive a top-up; they were never able to get that under the old package of the Australian Labor Party. Over 400,000 top-up payments for family tax benefit and child-care benefit were made for the 2000-01 financial year. They could also get it through the taxation system. It was stated quite clearly, on a number of pages in the TaxPack that went out recently, that tax refunds would be taken, say, if you had underestimated your income and therefore had had an overpayment. That has been in place for a considerable period of time. Indeed, that was always the intent when the legislation was introduced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I know that this issue will be of interest to members on both sides of the parliament. As announced last night by the Minister for Health and Ageing, the government has approved a national meningococcal disease vaccination program, intended to provide, ultimately, vaccinations for all Australians up to and including 19 years of age, which, on the medical advice available to the government, is the age cohort most at risk from the strains of this disease that are of very understandable concern to the entire Australian community. The national program will initially provide vaccines for children aged 12 months and for those aged 15 to 17. Those are the age groups which we are advised are at the highest element of risk. The free vaccine will be provided progressively to all remaining children and young people as supplies of this vaccine become available. Present advice is that the program will begin in early 2003 and the initial roll-out will be a cost of $41 million. But I should stress that, with a national health challenge of this magnitude, whilst cost is something that is always borne in mind, it will not act as a constraint in relation to the vaccination of people in the at-risk group. In other words, as the vaccine becomes available it will be purchased and injected into the program so that ultimately, over a number of years, all of the young Australians in the most exposed group will receive the benefit of this vaccination. The program cannot start until early next year because around 1.1 million doses are required for the initial roll-out, compared with only about 100,000 doses currently available in Australia. We are advised that it will take a few months to import the vaccine, given that there is a current worldwide shortage of the vaccine. The government is working closely with industry to see what can be done to speed up supplies of the vaccine. I should inform the House that about 60 per cent of all deaths in Australia are due to type C of the disease, for which the new vaccine will provide protection for a period of about 30 years. The government's decision follows recent detailed advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation on age groups at high risk of meningococcal disease.It is vitally important that doctors and the general public are aware of the symptoms of meningococcal disease. The majority of cases seen in Australia - 62 per cent - are type B of the disease, for which there is currently no vaccine available. As part of the national vaccination program, the government will provide information to doctors, health workers and the community.I think it is also important on an issue like this to make a few observations about lifestyle choices which can expose people to greater risk than would otherwise be the case. I noticed an observation by the shadow health minister this morning with which I totally agree; that is, that people who smoke or people who work or live in a smoking environment and people who have parents who smoke - and this is particularly the case with young children - are exposed to greater risk. It is another opportunity to emphasise, especially to young people in Australia, the enormous damage they do to their health if they continue to smoke. I do that not as some kind of pejorative zealot on the subject: I unfortunately had that habit myself when I was a young person. I just think it is important that, at every opportunity, people should be reminded of the damage they do to their health through smoking. Also, and very importantly, parents who are concerned about the possibility of their children contracting meningococcal disease and who smoke might think for a moment tonight as to the contribution they personally could make towards reducing the likelihood of their children contracting this absolutely abhorrent disease, which the government will do everything it possibly can to counteract and to eradicate.We are prepared to commit the resources and, as the vaccine becomes available, it will be bought and injected into the program so that all of the target group will, over time, be vaccinated and therefore given the maximum protection currently available against this disease.</DOC>

 - I am prepared to look at the practicality of that. I am not currently in possession of all of the detail of it, but I will have a look at it. It may or may not be practical. I do not know; I just do not know enough of the detail. I would, however, like to make the observation that, no matter what campaigns you spend money on and no matter what you do, there are some people in the community so irresponsible, not only about their own health but about the health of their children, that they will continue to do these absolutely irresponsible things and expose their children to quite unnecessary risks. There is, in the end, a bit of personal responsibility involved in that.  - I have endeavoured to respond in a constructive way to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not know whether it is practical. I do not know all the details about this pot of money to which the Leader of the Opposition refers. It may not be the least bit feasible, but we will have a look at it and we will let the parliament know.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I can inform her that, since 1996 when the government was elected, our Corporate Law Economic Reform Program has been modernising Australia's Corporations Law and putting in place a system which compares very favourably by world standards. In fact it is, as even the opposition have been forced to concede in the last 24 hours, certainly in front of that of the United States of America. A question was asked in the House yesterday as to whether the government would require the disclosure of options to company executives, and a moment's investigation by the opposition would have led them to the understanding that this is already required by the law; it is required by the Corporations Law and, if the opposition had been prepared to do a moment's investigation, they would have found that out.I also indicate that the government has put in place a system by which standards adopted by the Australian accounting standards boards have the force of law, unless disallowed by either house of this parliament. The standard which is being developed internationally in relation to options and shares - which is to be released in October - will, if adopted by the Australian accounting standards boards, have the force of law.Many of us can remember, coming off the late 1980s, the lax corporate regulation that persisted at that time. I can report to the House that the corporate regulator, ASIC, has been very engaged in bringing people before the courts and seeking to enforce the company laws. For example, former Harris Scarfe CFO Alan Hodgson was recently jailed for six years. Following the HIH collapse, company director Rodney Adler was banned from company management for 20 years and ordered to co-pay compensation of $7 million. Ray Williams was banned from company management for 10 years and ordered to pay $7 million compensation. Nicholas Whitlam was banned from being a company director for five years and ordered to pay penalties of $20,000. Some of those people, I should note, are appealing.In the last three years the Australian Securities and Investment Commission has taken action which has resulted in the jailing of 69 people for corporate crime for a maximum of 229 years of imprisonment. Today, it has 111 defendants before the courts facing criminal charges and 20 facing civil proceedings.In relation to funding, at the time of the last election the Labor Party proposed increasing funding to the corporate watchdog by $6 million. In the last budget the coalition increased funding by $90 million - $84 million more than the Australian Labor Party policy was calling for at the last election.It is true that our corporate regulation is in front of that of the United States in government reforms. I pay tribute to the former minister for financial services, the current secretary to the Treasurer, for the work done on the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. We need to keep this going. This has been an active, reformist government in this area. The last thing we would want would be a return to the days of the Skases and the Connells, the 1980s, as prevailed under Labor administrations. This government is entitled and determined to ensure that our corporate regulation continues to be a world leader. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his renewed interest in Australian families, because we know that the only interest the Australian Labor Party have when it comes to the welfare of Australian families is to scare them as much as possible and that the only families they are really interested in - before I address the question, Mr Speaker - are their brothers and sisters in the trade union movement. -  - As far as the question is concerned, it is unusual - and I think it is regrettable - that the member for Lilley uses individual cases in the sense of sensationalising -  -  - It is regrettable that they use individual cases in the parliament but as this case has been raised I think I should address it. Before I do, the question asked was: when did the government instigate this policy of reclaiming tax refunds? The bottom line is that this was in the legislation when it was put through in 2000. The family assistance office always had the capacity - as it does with other social security payments - to reclaim through tax refunds if they have been overpaid. I do not think that is unreasonable. I do not think Australian taxpayers think it is unreasonable that, if they are being paid more than they are entitled to, they pay it back. The whole premise of this question is that because of the family tax benefit we paid Australian families a substantial amount more. Because of that, there is an onus on them - and the member for Lilley knows this - to notify the family assistance office if there is a change in income. The member for Lilley raised this case, Mr Speaker, and I know that he is interested in Australian families as well. I have just been informed that this particular lady - she has two children, aged two and five - substantially underestimated both her and her partner's final actual income. There were frequent income re-estimations. Indeed, the income estimate back in February was $42,000, but the actual income was $47,000 for that year. She underestimated her income and we paid her more. There is an onus on her that, if she had been overpaid, like other Australian families, she would have had to pay it back. It was in the TaxPack, it was in the original legislation -  - I have to say that the member for Lilley has got form when it comes to intervening in individual lives, and I think it is again regrettable in this particular case. - As I have explained - as I am quite happy to do, although I do not think it is any more reason to go through this particular case - the facts are that this individual, maybe unknowingly, was paid more in Centrelink entitlements, particularly through family tax benefit. As far as the system is concerned, it has been very clear from when the legislation for the family tax benefit was implemented back in 2000 that there was an offset. I explained in my previous answer - I thought very succinctly - that in that first transition year we made special arrangements because of the significant increase that there had been in the family tax benefit and also because we thought it was appropriate that people had more time to get their estimates right.If you have a genuine concern about this case, I assume you have taken it to the minister now responsible for Centrelink, Senator Amanda Vanstone. I assume you have done that! Have you made personal representations? I suspect you have not. You are using this individual case to make a political point. It is regrettable because the facts are that the tax refund legislation was put in years ago. I think it is about time the member for Lilley knew that, if you have particular issues, you do not raise individual cases in this parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. The member for Grey represents Woomera and has been very interested in the circumstances of those people who have been detained there. The Migration Act requires that any person who arrives without lawful authority in Australia is to be detained until they are granted a visa or removed. That law applies as equally to adults as it does to children. Mandatory detention results from the manner in which people arrive and not the fact that they have sought asylum. We do endeavour to minimise the period of time taken to process people, as I explained yesterday when I answered a question on a similar matter. As at 16 August, 111 children are in detention. Some of those are detained as a result of compliance activities from the department - that is, normal compliance activities - and we would expect that they would be leaving Australia fairly shortly. The interests of children have been matters which have concerned the government and, I believe, members of parliament on both sides of the House. We have had in place over a long period of time arrangements which have enabled children to be released, in limited circumstances, on bridging visas. We have used this provision to particularly enable unaccompanied minors in detention to be held separately. The fact is that the interests of children have generally been recognised by competent authorities as being best served by remaining with their parents or with other family members.Children in detention are provided with a range of services. At the moment something of the order of 31 are studying in primary and high schools in the community in Australia and there are a number in preschools and playgroups. Those who are in the detention environment receive access to services within the detention centre. - Yes, they do. While there have been calls for children to be released from detention, most people who make those calls do so in the expectation that not only children but also their parents should be released at the same time, regardless of whether they have a lawful entitlement to be in Australia. That outcome is not going to be achieved.Given that a particular state Premier has recently been commenting on these matters in South Australia, I want to reiterate and make it very clear that I have always said that, if the competent authorities, which are the state welfare authorities, advise that it is in the best interests of a child or children to be held separately from their parents and in the community, I would accept that advice and they would be released on appropriate bridging visas. The fact is that no competent authority in any state has made such a recommendation - and they have been specifically asked to do so. At the time when there were some riots occurring in South Australia and there were children involved in lip-sewing, I wanted the state authority to see whether or not the children involved in that activity were at risk and whether they should in fact be fostered and separated from their parents. The competent authority declined to make such a recommendation.The fact is that we have been looking at an alternative detention project for women and children. It has been operating in Woomera since August. That alternative detention model has enabled participants to live in a more relaxed family atmosphere and to carry on more routine activities. A total of 108 people - 37 women and 71 children - have been involved in the project since its inception. Currently there are 18 residents involved - eight women and 10 children - and 13 of those were added after expansion of the eligibility criteria. I asked for an evaluation of the project to be undertaken. That trial has shown to be successful -  - And after considering the recommendations of the evaluation, I have agreed to expand the eligibility criteria for women and children. - That arrangement has now been in place for some little time. Yesterday in an answer to a question on the same matter, I said that something like 40 per cent of people who were rejected remain in Australia. In fact, 40 per cent is the proportion who left. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley because, unlike the previous questioner, he did not reveal the name to the House. That obviously distinguishes the propriety of some backbenchers of the Labor Party from that of the front bench. I would say that your career prospects have just increased dramatically on the basis of that. I assume you have taken up that individual case with the relevant minister, and we can look into it. I would like to reiterate - because I have a suspicion that the next batch of questions will be the same, which goes to show how bereft of policy are the Labor Party -  - As I have clearly stated before, if you want to consult the TaxPack, you will find that the TaxPack very clearly states that if you have underestimated your income and you have therefore received more family tax benefit than you were entitled to, then we have a right to reclaim that through the tax refund. There is nothing secret about this agenda. As I said, it has been there since the time the legislation was introduced. Obviously the Labor Party have again been asleep on the job. I can assure you that the ministers responsible for Centrelink and Centrelink have gone out of their way, through advertising campaigns, through numerous information campaigns, through the family assistance office and through the taxation arm, to educate Australian families to ensure that they get their correct entitlements. That is precisely why, when the legislation was introduced, we put in special provisions whereby you could receive a top-up payment. Of course, under the old social security system that we inherited from Labor, you never had the opportunity of receiving a top-up payment. This way you do. That is why we have given Australian families the option and the choice. But, as I have said before, Centrelink have been quite responsive in ensuring that, if a family is having difficulty, there is a debt repayment schedule, particularly with those entitlements coming from family assistance. But, as far as any secret agenda is concerned, there has been no secret agenda at all. I do hope that, if the member really wants to represent this individual case, he brings it to the government, and we will look at it. This would be in stark contrast to the previous question. I think it is inappropriate to go through all the details - but perhaps later on we will - where the member for Lilley has been totally offline.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I acknowledge that he and a number of other members of the House have recently been to the Middle East, including to the Persian Gulf, where they had the opportunity to meet with Australian members of the multinational interception force. I congratulate those members of this House who undertook that mission, because it was an important mission and one that I know was well received by the members of the Royal Australian Navy.The Multinational Maritime Interception Force was created in 1990 to help to enforce the sanctions which were established by United Nations Security Council resolution 665. These sanctions are designed to prevent Iraq from getting supplies to rebuild its military. The multinational interception force has impounded many millions of dollars worth of oil which has been illicitly exported by the Iraqi government as part of its efforts to generate unsupervised income. It is important to do this because it prevents the purchase of weapons and other non-humanitarian imports for the Iraqi regime. The multinational interception force also aids in constraining Baghdad's capacity to import prohibited items by sea. Following September 11 last year, the Australian Defence Force involvement in multinational interception force operations was incorporated into what is called Operation Slipper - our contribution in support of the United States response to international terrorism. Since our involvement under Operation Slipper, there have been 360 boardings of suspect vessels; 150 of these were non-compliant with Security Council resolutions. The multinational interception force incorporates vessels from eight countries: Argentina, Kuwait, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as Australia. We have been a longstanding contributor to the MIF. Our forces have been deployed on 13 occasions as part of the multinational interception force since it was established. Australia's contribution at present is two frigates - HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Arunta - together with embarked helicopter support and a command element.On 8 January, the government announced that an officer of the Royal Australian Navy, Captain Peter Sinclair, had assumed tactical command of the multinational interception force. I think the Australian Navy does a very fine job in these difficult circumstances. I understand that, when the parliamentary committee was recently on board both HMAS Arunta and HMAS Melbourne, the temperature was in the vicinity of 50 degrees Centigrade. Day by day, our sailors are operating in that sort of environment. This contribution to the multinational interception force demonstrates the strength of Australia's commitment to the enforcement of United Nations Security Council resolutions and our role in maintaining the integrity of the sanctions regime - and that is a regime that is critical to efforts to pressure Iraq to adhere to United Nations Security Council resolutions on weapons of mass destruction. This is an involvement the government is committed to maintaining. We will not be backing away from it; we think it is a useful contribution that Australia can make to trying to resolve these difficult issues in the Middle East.</DOC>

 - The Australian social security system works on a means-tested basis - a principle which I believed, at least until today, had bipartisan support. The means-tested basis on which the Australian social security system works is that people are entitled to benefits on the basis of the income they earn. You could have a non-means-tested social security system in which everybody was entitled to social security benefits but which would cost, obviously, quite a considerably greater amount than the current one does. As a consequence - and it has been up until today supported by the Labor Party - if a person's income rises, their benefits accordingly taper down. We reduced the taper rate and increased benefits to people who receive family allowance; that is, we kicked the threshold, we kicked the ceilings out and we reduced some taper rates. Nonetheless, they still taper out.As the minister has explained, where a person's income rises, consequently under a means-tested social security system a person receives less in allowances. That is a principle which, up until today, has been a feature of bipartisan policy. I notice that the Labor Party has tried to make great play today of the way in which this operates. If the Labor Party is against means testing social security allowances, you had better say it.  - Come to the dispatch box, have the honesty of your convictions and say that people should not have their allowances taper off as their income rises. If that is your position, say that, and we will cost it for you and we will give the Australian public some idea of the tax rates which would be required to sustain it. But, in a situation where you have hitherto supported - indeed, in some respects, introduced - a system where allowances have always declined as income has risen, please do not have the hypocrisy to try to suggest you are against it when you do not have the courage to say so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. Over the past 25 years, as members probably know, the unionised proportion of the Australian work force has fallen from over a half to under a quarter. Some unions have reacted to this by trying to win by coercion what they have been unable to obtain by persuasion. I regret to say that some unions, with the support of the ACTU, are now seeking to charge non-union members a $500 a year fee for services they have not requested and do not necessarily need. This is a scam. If a company did it, it would be illegal. What is unlawful under corporate law should also be unlawful under workplace law. To their credit, some of the more thoughtful figures in the labour movement share the government's concerns about these compulsory union levies. For instance, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, has said:You can't put a tax on other members of the work force and the state can't require the collection of union fees from non-unionists. To his credit, the member for Barton said last year:Before I felt comfortable with that concept - compulsory union levies - I'd want to know why unions are unable to recruit members in a particular area.Good on the member for Barton and good on Bob Carr for their views, but, unfortunately, thanks to the 60-40 rule in some states and the 50-50 rule in other states - thanks to those union block votes - the national interest is always trumped by union votes and union money when it comes to the crunch. It is only going to get worse because, under the Hawke-Wran reforms, the union block vote is actually going to increase at the national conference from zero per cent to 50 per cent. That is the increase in the union block vote as a result of the Hawke-Wran reforms. Tonight, in the Senate, I very much fear that the opposition are going to vote in ways which expose up to five million non-union members to a $500 a year union tax. The Leader of the Opposition has already squibbed the first test of party reform by imposing an old-fashioned head office fix on the voters of Cunningham. Here is another test for him to prove that the party really has changed and for him to prove that he is bigger than his background by telling his senators to support the government's compulsory union fees bill. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. In the member's electorate is Western Port Steel, which, of course, was shut down by recent industrial action which also affected the car industry. On a more positive note, it is pleasing to see that retail sales in the Australian automotive market have continued to be strong, and July's figures show a 5.4 per cent increase on the figures for July last year. In fact, today's ABS figures confirm that new motor vehicle sales have risen 6.3 per cent in the last 12 months - so much so that the FCAI has forecast total vehicle sales for 2002 to be more than 800,000 units.These figures cap off a great few months for the car industry. Toyota are about to release their new V6 Camry, which I can tell you, Mr Speaker, is an exceptional vehicle. Mitsubishi have made a commitment to boost their exports and Holden will start exporting Monaros, as the Minister for Trade has already outlined. Holden will also release a new model, as will Ford. It is a shame that the trade unions do not get behind the car industry. It is interesting with the soon to be released Productivity Commission report which will map the next five years for the car industry from 2005 that the reaction of Doug Cameron from the AMWU is to say that he will greet that report not with the challenge that it may present, not with the support that it deserves, but with a significant, coordinated, industrial response.In fact, to quote him directly from the Australian on 30 July, he said, `There's going to be a huge backlash.' Nothing poses a greater risk and threat to the car industry in Australia than the outrageous behaviour of the unions, and it is about time the Leader of the Opposition had a word to his mates in the union and told them to get behind the car industry instead of trying to destroy it.</DOC>

 - As I informed the House earlier, and contrary to the false information which the Labor Party insinuated yesterday, Australian law in the Corporations Act requires the senior directors of companies to disclose in their annual reports options and shares. That is the Australian law -  - contrary to the allegation which was made by the member for Fraser and the Leader of the Opposition in the House yesterday. Yes, contrary to the allegations that were made by the Labor Party yesterday. Regrettably, they were made; but they were false. In relation to the enforcement of the law, as I have already indicated the Australian government put in place the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which is charged with enforcing law in courts of law. People still have their rights. The prosecutor brings action and these matters are heard by the corporate prosecutor. As I indicated earlier, the government has funded the corporate prosecutor well in advance of anything the Labor Party thought should be done. When the Labor Party called for increased resources of $6 million, the government allocated an additional $90 million. In addition to that, as I have also indicated, that corporate prosecutor currently has 111 defendants before the courts facing criminal charges and 20 facing civil proceedings. We live under the rule of law, and under the rule of law the government passes the law through the parliament, which, I think we now agree, deals with this matter. The government funds a prosecutor which has this charge - and I think it has been much more active. I think ASIC says that it has reason to believe that it is probably the most active corporate enforcer in the world. The matters go to the courts. People are entitled to a trial in the court and the courts deliver judgments. The courts have delivered a number of judgments in relation to these matters. If the honourable member thinks that he knows of credible evidence of somebody who is in breach of the law, he should pass it on to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission because it would no doubt be able to use that evidence in a court of law in accordance with the rule of law, which is the way in which these things operate.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She is also a former small business woman and someone who has taken a marginal Labor seat and made it a safe Liberal seat - as a result, I suspect, of her support for small business. It is my very sad duty to report to the House that last night the Labor Party sided with the unions and voted down the government's small business protection bill in the Senate.Australia's one million small businesses cannot always afford to defend themselves when they are the innocent victims of a secondary boycott. So we, the coalition, wanted to give the ACCC more power to go in there and bat for small businesses, which are the innocent victims of secondary boycotts.Last night, in an unholy alliance, the Labor Party and the Democrats came together to knock off a bill that was going to help small business. Sympathy strikes - which is what they used to call them - such as coal workers striking in support of transport workers do have a tremendous impact on small business, which may be the innocent victim. Yet last night the Labor Party went to bat for the unions and defeated the interests of small business.The member for Gilmore asked me why; why did they do that? You do not need to be Albert Einstein to understand that the Labor Party has been putting the interests of the unions ahead of the interests of small businesses. The recommendation on secondary boycotts came from the Baird committee back in 1999. Some of the key supporters of the recommendations included some members of the opposition. It is quite an eclectic bunch if you look at it. The key supporters included: the member for Cunningham, who is no longer here; Senator Chris Schacht, who is no longer here; Senator Michael Forshaw - and we know what happened to him lately, don't we?; the member for Namadgi knows - and the member for Hunter as well.It is interesting to see that those people who originally went in there to support small business all suffered some form of fateful knifing. It is really ugly, isn't it: the way the unions seek retribution, through the Labor Party, against those people who initially go in to support small business. All of those voices that supported small business in the Labor Party have been drowned out by the union voices. The Leader of the Opposition's rhetoric on reform and curbing the power of the trade unions in the ALP has been blown away by this measure. A little earlier, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations mentioned that there are a couple of key tests of how the Leader of the Opposition is going in dealing with the unions. The Leader of the Opposition failed the key test last night on the secondary boycott bill. Once again, we went in to back small business and the Labor Party did not. Mr Speaker, if you are looking for any justification beyond the Hawke-Wran report, I found this very interesting quote from the web site Workers Online, which must be the new technology equivalent of the Little Red Book. Nick Lewocki, the New South Wales state secretary of the public transport union, gave us a snapshot of what the Labor Party really believes in. He said:How many small businesspeople stood on polling booths or letter-boxed for the ALP ... How many small businesses pay a percentage of their profits to the ALP? Not many. It's our Party and if they don't want to be part of it, they should leave.Mr Speaker, if you want any evidence that the Labor Party is wholly owned by the unions, have a look at the way they voted on secondary boycotts last night. They again put the interests of the unions ahead of the interests of Australia's one million small businesses.</DOC>

 - As I said, the Corporations Law requires in annual reports, in accordance with the provisions of the act, remuneration of the five senior executives by way of shares or options. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is funded - much more than the ALP ever wanted to do - to bring actions. If the honourable member believes he has evidence that the law has been broken, he should pass it across to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I do not know if he is alleging that, but one suspects that, having had a bad Newspoll, the Leader of the Opposition has decided to try to open up a new front. I would not talk too much about polls if I were the Australian Labor Party. Probably what happened this morning was unforeseen.  - After the latest Newspoll, the Leader of the Opposition said, `What can we do today? We'll feign an interest in corporate regulation.' In his three years as shadow Treasurer, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition ever showed any interest in corporate regulation. When Corporate Law Economic Reform Program 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were put into place, they dramatically improved Australia's corporate regulation. The Leader of the Opposition has been moved to say in the last 24 hours, `It's better than the United States.' We have in train an arrangement which will put in place a standard from the Australian Accounting Standards Board on the methodology for expensing, options and shares. This will be amongst the first in the world -  - With the Australian Accounting Standards Board adopting the International Accounting Standards Board's recommendations, we could have in place, with an exposure draft from October this year, the international standard. Such a standard has not been adopted in the United States or in any comparable jurisdictions. After that has been exposed, if it is acceptable - and one would want it to be in accordance with international practices - Australian companies will report not just in Australia but to foreign exchanges as well. It would have the force of law in Australia unless it were disallowed by either house of parliament. As I said earlier, this puts our system of corporate regulation not only in advance of the United States - as has been conceded by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Fraser - but in advance of comparable jurisdictions around the world. It is the result of six years of hard work.We have to continue to work in relation to all of these things, but after six years of hard work we have put our corporate regulation in advance of the United States. It would not have occurred had it not been for the work of this government. I pay tribute to Mr Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation as he then was, and Senator Ian Campbell, the Secretary to the Treasury in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. While Australia produces only about one per cent of world greenhouse emissions, the Howard government is determined to put in place world-leading programs to reduce those emissions and position Australia for a less carbon tolerant world. With nearly $1 billion in funding, our programs are already projected to deliver some 60 million tonnes of abatement a year by the end of the decade, which is the equivalent of taking all Australia's passenger cars off the road. This is an achievement that has put us well on track to meet our Kyoto target.Australian industry is already involved in a range of very successful programs, such as the Greenhouse Challenge and the greenhouse friendly program. This week is an opportunity for Australian families to assess what they can do to make a contribution. This week is National Science Week. Households are responsible for one-fifth of Australia's national greenhouse emissions. Household heating and cooling, refrigeration, computers, lighting and other electrical appliances all add to our greenhouse total. During National Science Week, the major project for the week is a project known as the National Kilowatt Count. Through the National Kilowatt Count, every Australian household has the chance to monitor and assess their own energy output. I encourage all Australians to participate before the end of next week by visiting www.kilowattcount.gov.au to assess their own contribution to greenhouse emissions.I am also pleased to report that under Cities for Climate Protection more than 150 local councils, representing over 60 per cent of the Australian population, are already working at the community level to reduce greenhouse emissions in both their corporate operations and their communities. Last week, I visited a family in suburban Melbourne who have taken it on themselves to reduce their greenhouse emissions from some 10 tonnes per year to one tonne per year. They have done that by using solar heating. They have done it by compact fluorescent lights and other energy efficient appliances. And they use them carefully.Of course, the opposition has absolutely no interest in these practical measures. The opposition's interest is solely for Australia to sign a flawed international treaty, to place additional burdens on Australian business and to ship Australian jobs overseas. Unlike organisations such as Greenpeace and the Australian Labor Party, the government does not believe in unnecessarily giving up Australian sovereignty and damaging job opportunities. Kyoto is not the answer. I draw to members' attention the excellent piece by Dr Alex Robson in today's Canberra Times. Dr Robson wrote as follows: A poorly chosen policy response might only marginally affect climate change ... but at the same time it might involve economic costs today that are unacceptably high.Dr Robson went on:Many economists ... believe that the Kyoto Protocol is a good example of such a flawed policy response.He concludes that if we ratify Kyoto as Labor says we should: ... ordinary Australians could end up paying twice.Mr Speaker, this government will not allow that to happen.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the focus on auditors has come about principally as a response to the Arthur Andersen audit on Enron and the collapse of Arthur Andersen worldwide, to which the United States has made various responses. They will be well considered by the government in the context of Australia's inquiry into auditing, which is in relation to the royal commission on HIH. The royal commission on HIH, which was set up by this government, will be looking at the role of auditors in relation to HIH and the collapse of that organisation. Mr Speaker, if the member for Fraser were really interested in corporate regulation, he might pay a bit of credit to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which, notwithstanding the continuation of the royal commission, has already brought proceedings against some of the directors of HIH. Although they are on appeal, they have been given very substantial penalties as a result of some of the matters which have come to light. Obviously, the royal commissioner will be making findings about the audit and how it was conducted in HIH by Arthur Andersen. Why would the government move in advance of the findings of the royal commission? One normally calls a royal commission in order to get findings and recommendations. It is not normally a good principle to call a royal commission and then to act in disregard of the findings or before they are made. I have indicated - as have the minister who was then responsible and Senator Campbell, who was primarily responsible for these matters - that the government will be acting on the recommendations of the royal commissioner. Why would one legislate through the parliament then receive the royal commissioner's findings, which could actually make recommendations which were different to the way in which one had legislated? We have an inquiry into HIH and its auditing. It will be reporting. It will be making recommendations. The government will be acting on those recommendations. That is the reason why the government called the HIH royal commission and that is the way in which we will handle its findings.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the member for Blair and I thank him for his question. I also acknowledge his active commitment to the veterans in his electorate. I am delighted to announce today that I will be launching Saluting their Service. This is the federal government's new commemorations program in the 60th year of the anniversary of the battle for Australia. I would also like to acknowledge the successful visit by the Prime Minister to Isurava on the Kokoda Track last week - 10 Kokoda veterans attended and paid homage to their mates. This new program will build on the success of previous commemoration programs. I would like to acknowledge the work of my predecessors, the Hon. Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa, and also the Hon. Con Sciacca, the member for Bowman, in paying tribute to our veterans. This program will further strengthen the educational focus of Australia's wartime involvement, our involvement in conflicts and the involvement of our peacekeepers. It will be a modern commemoration program. It will include a package for the 21st century which is aimed at utilising IT and the Internet. It will focus on living memorials and on assisting our young people to gain a greater appreciation of the history, involvement and the importance of our Defence Force. The government will also focus, through this important program, on creating better opportunities for the broader community to own part of their own wartime history.Saluting their Service will continue the grants program that preserves commemorative memorials in local communities and will acknowledge our military heritage in these local communities. It will also continue and expand on the certificate of appreciation that is given to convey our government's appreciation to our veterans and to the younger veterans who have served in peacetime service in East Timor and in Bougainville. This program will continue to send an important message of remembrance and respect to younger Australians. Last year we celebrated our Centenary of Federation. It was 100 years of nationhood. It was 100 years of the mightiest little democracy in the whole world. We should never contemplate our bright future without remembering how we got here and whom we owe. That is the reason for the Saluting their Service program. I invite everyone here to attend the launch. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maribyrnong for his question. It runs together a couple of issues, one of which was the subject of a question to me yesterday from the member for Barton. I noticed in a news report subsequent to question time yesterday that the member for Barton was running around asserting, both to the Sydney Morning Herald and to Radio 6PR in Perth, that the coalition had cut some $400 million out of legal aid. That figure is fantasy. In fact, we have not cut anything out of legal aid. What we did was to focus the Commonwealth legal aid funding on matters arising under Commonwealth law. - We removed the inappropriate, unnecessary subsidy of state law matters and put the onus on the state and territory governments to fund it themselves. As a consequence of our action -   - we have not reduced legal aid funding for Commonwealth law matters; we have in fact increased it. Since 1996 there has been no reduction whatever. Another beneficial advantage of the action that was taken was that the aggregate funding from state and territory governments for legal aid in 1995-96 has increased to $131 million in the last two financial years. That is a positive boon. We have retained our responsibility and we have actually added to it. In the four years from 1 July 2000, we will be adding an aggregate $63 million to Commonwealth law funding.The member for Maribyrnong also referred to the legal assistance scheme that applies in respect of the HIH royal commission. This is a scheme, as I pointed out yesterday, that has run since the 1980s. That scheme has not been means tested since its inception. The Treasurer was asked questions today about family law payments and he pointed out that it has been bipartisan policy - policy on both sides of the House - for family law payments to be means tested. Since the early eighties it has been bipartisan policy - policy on both sides of this House - for legal assistance for royal commissions not to be means tested. The Treasurer challenged Labor to say they had changed their policy in respect of family payments. I challenge Labor to say that they have changed their policy in respect of legal assistance for royal commissions. There are reasons why legal assistance for royal commissions is not means tested. The scheme is designed to enable all people with a central role in the proceedings to have access to legal representation and to assist royal commissions in their tasks. It helps the royal commission get to the bottom of a story. The commission is engaged in a fact-finding exercise in the public interest and, by providing those central to the fact-finding exercise with legal assistance, it can be ensured that they participate fully and understand their responsibility to do so.As the Labor Party knows, based on its experience of providing money under the same scheme for commissions and inquiries, this kind of assistance is very different to legal aid. The royal commissions are not set up to determine the guilt or innocence of individuals, although that may become an issue, but the fact-finding exercise they undertake helps determine whether prosecutions should or could be undertaken. It is not appropriate that this exercise be impeded by key players not obtaining legal advice. The questions from the member for Barton and the member for Maribyrnong have related to the means testing of assistance provided to players in the HIH royal commission. They have not related to the players in the building and construction industry royal commission. Is the policy that the Labor Party seeks to apply to the key players in the HIH exercise equally, in Labor Party policy, applicable to the trade union leaders who are before the building and construction industry commission?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. An important part of the process that we are trying to address as one of the lead nations in the multilateral round of negotiations is a much improved circumstance for the global trade of sugar, a commodity that is very important to the member for Dawson, as her electorate produces a sizeable amount of the export sugar in Australia. Of course, our government is very focused on and committed to ensuring that we achieve a much fairer international trading regime as far as the sugar industry is concerned, particularly at the moment in its significant hour of need. Our government is certainly working very closely with the Australian export sugar industry. More broadly, the question was: how does Australia stand to benefit from a decent outcome of this round? I will give some statistics. An increase of just 10 per cent in Australian exports could create 70,000 new Australian jobs. It is quite instructive - and the Labor Party might recognise the fact - that, since 1996, Australia's exports have increased from $99 billion a year to $154 billion a year and have made a significant contribution to the 972,000 new jobs that have been created while our government has been in office. A 50 per cent reduction in global trade protection would deliver an economic boost of more than $7 billion per year to the Australian economy - that is $350 for every man, woman and child every year, and that figure would grow as trade grows. Therefore Australia is playing a lead role in moving the multilateral agenda forward in the current round of the Doha negotiations.Last year, in the lead-up to the meeting in Doha after the failure in Seattle, at Australia's urging we conducted a number of informal ministerial meetings that created the framework and the environment to achieve a successful launch of a round in Doha last year. Those meetings were held in Mexico and Singapore. Since the round was launched, I have urged my ministerial colleagues in the WTO to continue that practice, to the point that we have reached agreement with the major players that, on 14 and 15 November this year, we will host a mini-ministerial in Sydney for the leading trade ministers in the WTO, from about 25 of the core countries, and including developing countries, least developed countries and small island states, so that the interests of the broader membership of the WTO are involved in what will be a critical part of the process of these negotiations. If we achieve a successful outcome, it will not just benefit countries like Australia, where we obviously look for improvement in the agricultural sector, particularly in the area of sugar that is of such interest to the member for Dawson. Just as importantly, it will benefit the developing countries of the world which are entitled to, and deserve, better access into the wealthier markets of the world for their agricultural products. That is what we are about in this agenda; and Australia has, under the leadership of our government, continued to play a major role in moving this agenda forward. Earlier this year at the Australian-American leadership dialogue in Washington - I know there were a number of members of the opposition present at that discussion and the dinner there - the US Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick, made a comment about Australia's role in moving the whole multilateral agenda forward in such a way that we can see the possibility of productive outcomes. He said:Last year, the United States and Australia worked closely together to launch the new global trade negotiations at Doha, reversing the failure of Seattle. I did my best work through the challenges of 142 economies, until my colleague and friend - yours truly - Mark Vaile could join us after Australia's elections. Once he arrived the momentum picked up, triggering an all-night session that clinched the deal.Australia has maintained a leadership role in the WTO and in the multilateral agenda, at the same time as being able to continue our bilateral push to improve the circumstances of our exporters. So in November this year there will be another critical instalment along the pathway to a successful outcome of this round that will be facilitated by our government and by Australia.</DOC>

 - The opposition leader is right in saying that developments in biomedical procedures do raise very complicated ethical issues. I will give some consideration to what he has put forward, but let me say this so that he does not assume that that is yes: one of the problems I have with propositions which say you should establish a commission to tell you about all of these things is that it does tend bit by bit to take away from the parliament and governments the right to decide these issues. I do not subscribe to the view that you should establish a statutory commission to make decisions that are normally the prerogative of elected governments. I know there are some people in this country who believe that you should hand over all decisions to statutory bodies, which would leave you with the ludicrous situation of the elected government of the day, whether it is a Labor government or Liberal government, getting all of the blame and having none of the authority and the responsibility. I am not one who thinks that this parliament is incapable of taking decisions about ethical matters. I think in the end we are as enabled and as enfranchised - indeed, more so - than most, because we are a mirror of the Australian community, and I do not think we should ever lose sight of that fact. Subject to that very important reservation and conditioning attitude, I will consider it. But, if it involves removing the authority of this parliament to decide on ethical matters, then I am totally opposed to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. The member for Macarthur is a very appropriate person to ask such a question. He - and the Macarthur region generally - has a particular interest in China and in relations with China. For example, the Macarthur region has a regional partnership with one of the cities in Shandong Province. In recent months I have met two delegations from the province brought to me by the honourable member.Mr Speaker, 2002 is an important milestone in Australia's relationship with China, being the 30th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. In that period - since 1973 anyway - our two-way trade with China has grown from $113 million to $18 billion in 2001. Since 1996, Australia's exports to China have nearly doubled.The economic relationship is obviously continuing to burgeon, including in the area of energy. The LNG contract will boost Australia's exports to China by up to around $1 billion a year - or in the vicinity of 13 per cent. Obviously, this $25 billion LNG contract was a tremendous win for our resources sector and all of those, including the Prime Minister and ministers, who gave such strong backing to the sector to get the contract. But I do think, more than that, that this contract represents what inevitably will be a real spur for our bilateral economic relationship. It will, I think, advance very substantially on the back of that much enhanced linkage.It is true, though, that the political links between Australia and China are also very close and very constructive. Eight of our ministers visited China last year and, as everyone knows, the Prime Minister had a very successful visit in May. But our relationship is not just about trade. In November this year, Australia will be the feature country at the Shanghai Arts Festival. I am delighted that the Australian International Cultural Council, which I chair, has decided to give particular emphasis to promoting Australian artists and culture in China at that important festival. This is going to be, again, another great step forward in the understanding by the Chinese people of the strength of Australian arts and culture.Finally, last week we had a very productive sixth bilateral human rights dialogue meeting with China. We raised a number of concerns in relation to Tibet, the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, the question of the Falun Gong, the reform of China's legal system, and so on. Our human rights dialogue with China was one of the first-ever human rights dialogues established with China, and my department advises me that we are the only country which has a human rights dialogue with China held at the vice-ministerial level; that is, China's delegation is led by a vice-minister. I came to Canberra last week with the specific purpose of meeting the leader of the Chinese delegation and having the opportunity to discuss human rights issues as well a number of other issues with him. I think the extraordinary success of our relationship with China - and I was reminded of it only last night when I hosted a dinner for Donald Tsang, the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong - is symbolic of the very great success of this government in pursuing its policy of constructive and practical engagement with Asia. This relationship and, increasingly, our relationships with our ASEAN partners at the economic level, and in terms of working together on people-smuggling, fighting terrorism and so on, are relationships which are moving forward with great strength and with a great deal of confidence. I am proud of what the Prime Minister and the government have done to take forward these relationships. </DOC>

 - As I fully answered this question yesterday, let me repeat what I said then. Professor Ramsay's report was done in advance of the developments of WorldCom and Enron, and did not take into account either those matters or the US congressional response. Obviously the government will be taking into account the US congressional response, if only for the reason that, with worldwide accounting firms, the US legislation will obviously govern their worldwide operations, including in Australia.The Ramsay report, which the government has also released, does not take into account Australia's own experience in relation to HIH. We have a royal commission which will look at the audit in relation to HIH and, I have no doubt, will make recommendations. The government will be releasing shortly the ninth of its corporate law reform proposals, which will pick up Professor Ramsay's report, developments in relation to Enron and WorldCom and, eventually, the developments in relation to the royal commission - as soon as they are made - and will give us the opportunity to have a fully considered legislative response. The proposition that we should re-regulate the audit profession now, do a second wave after the US response and a third wave after the royal commission is, as I said yesterday, flying in the face of the reason for the royal commission. One normally gets the results of a royal commission before acting. One very rarely acts before the royal commission has reported. That is the reason why you have a royal commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and for his interest in our international trading relationships - particularly those with the countries of the Middle East, which are growing at a rapid pace and becoming significantly important to the economic wellbeing of Australia.The member will be pleased to know that last year Australia exported $7.5 billion worth of goods and services to a whole range of countries in the Middle East region. In fact, as of Monday this week, you can add another $25 million to that, with the announcement of the wheat sales to Jordan and Libya. Exports to the Middle East grew by 13.8 per cent during that time, compared with growth of total exports of 1.4 per cent. Over the last four years, exports to the Middle East grew at an average annual rate of 22.7 per cent, compared with growth in total exports over the period of 8.4 per cent. These exports included milk, meat, live animals and specialised industrial machinery, as well as grain such as wheat. Interestingly and most importantly, members of the opposition would be interested in this statistic: the best export to the Middle East is Australia's passenger motor vehicles, which have been an outstanding success, growing from $400 million in 1997-98 to $1.8 billion in 2001-02. That is $1,800 million worth of auto exports to the Middle East coming from Australia's manufacturing base. That is an outstanding success story in anybody's terms.The question was asked whether there were any threats to this. Of course, there are threats to these exports. An opposition member - The foreign minister! - It's not the foreign minister; it's Doug Cameron of the AMWU. That is who it is! - This year this industry has suffered at the hands of strike action by the AMWU on three separate occasions - militant strike action -   - `Militant', I said. There has been militant strike action in this industry. It has tried to bring down this industry that is an outstanding success story. It is an industry that generates jobs right throughout the electorates represented by those opposite. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point should be made that, on three separate occasions, this industry - and the success of this industry - has been put at risk, has been jeopardised, by the militant action of the union movement. It is something that, in their own publication - their own yearbook - they indicate that they intend to continue. I will quote their yearbook, Australia at the crossroads. It certainly is; I think it should be rebadged The Australian Labor Party and the union movement at the crossroads. This is Doug Cameron -  - I quote from this publication:Our proud traditions of militancy need to be renewed and refined.It went on to say:Campaign 2000 and campaign 2001 set us on a path out of the enterprise bargaining trap.It went on to say:The campaign was strategic and laid the ground for another major step forward in 2003.So what is in store from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian union movement and the AMWU for the auto sector in 2003? The auto sector want to take their exports from five billion to 10 billion, but they cannot do it with this monkey on their back. The Australian people and the Australian Labor Party should criticise heavily the actions of this union in this industry when the industry is working so hard to generate increased exports and, particularly, generate jobs in Australia - and jobs in the electorates of many of the members who sit opposite, including that of the Leader of the Opposition.As we saw on one newspaper front page recently, the Leader of the Opposition should get on with the job of focusing on real jobs for real Australians, and protecting those, rather than the navel-gazing that he has been up to. The Leader of the Opposition, in his reform process and his handing over of 50 per cent of the control of the Australian Labor Party to the union movement, is going to be handing it over to the militancy of the AMWU. </DOC>

 - Again, as I fully explained to the House yesterday - I am very happy to go through it again - the Corporations Law requires, in relation to each director and the five named officers receiving the highest emolument, details of the nature and amount of each element of the emolument to be in the directors' report. That is enforced by ASIC. If one looked carefully at the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, one would have seen that there is considerable argument about how to value options. The point I also made in a speech I gave on Monday night was that the valuation of options - and bear in mind that the Corporations Law requires nature and amount - has been a matter of some argument. The AASB, the Australian Accounting Standards Board, has put out a proposed accounting standard on that called `Directors, Executive and Related Party Disclosures', which was issued on 31 May 2002. That becomes law unless disallowed by either house of parliament. In addition to that, Australia, because it is in front of the United States and comparable jurisdictions around the world, has announced that it will be following the IASB. The IASB is proposing to put out another exposure draft, which will be an international draft, in October 2002. Because of the reforms that this government put in place, once standards are made by the AASB they have the force of law unless disallowed by either house of parliament. So, in relation to valuation, we have from the AASB an exposure draft which is already out and, in relation to the international standard, we have the adoption of the international standard - an international standard which would allow Australian companies which are reporting to use the same methodology in foreign exchanges. Of course, the United States does not have a valuation standard. This is another area where Australia leads the world, and it is the result of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, which this government has put in place since 1996.I notice that the tactics committee gave the question to one of the backbenchers to ask; no doubt because both the shadow Treasurer and the leader of the Labor Party - and this may be unknown to that member of the backbench - have in the last 48 hours acknowledged that Australia's corporate regulation is in advance of the United States. So we might ask: which jurisdictions have a better system than Australia? The United Kingdom, with the establishment of the Financial Services Authority, have in many respects adopted the Australian model. So we have AASB and IASB in relation to exposure drafts - the Labor Party were caught out again wrong on the facts, wrong on the law. The Labor Party's interest in corporate regulation commenced around 48 hours ago - no interest in CLERP1, no interest in CLERP2, no interest in CLERP3, no interest in CLERP4, no interest in CLERP5 and no interest in CLERP6.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question about the economy, the state of the Australian economy and how it affects the lives of people in her electorate and Australians generally. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute released its index of economic activity today, and it consists of two parts. The first part consists of the coincident index, which measures circumstances as they apply at the moment. The coincident index actually strengthened, which is consistent with an Australian economy which is growing quite strongly. In addition to that, the release includes a leading index, which tries to measure circumstances as they may be in six to nine months. The leading index turned down below the long-term trend of three per cent. These indexes bounce around on a considerable basis - and one would not want to put too much store on them from any month to month - but, in particular, what affected the leading index was the share price index, which has fallen quite considerably over recent weeks and in the wake of international developments in equity markets. Without putting too much into the leading index, one should observe from this that the international situation is still very volatile, that the movement on world equity markets will have some confidence effects in relation to Australian business and the economy, and that in a world which is very unstable, particularly with the United States - which is the engine of global growth - being very unstable, policy makers in Australia need to be very focused on economic management at a time like this.The good news is that Australia still continues to outperform the rest of the developed world as the strongest growing of the industrialised countries of the world, according to most forecasts. But there is more to be done. One of the best things that could be done would be for the Labor Party to pass in the Senate the government's legislation to strengthen our economy. It is a matter of deep regret that, after seven years in opposition, the Labor Party is more opportunistic than ever, less interested in good economic policy and less interested in building the kinds of conditions that will set Australia up for the years to come. The Labor Party, for cheap opportunism, has rejected key budget measures to try to put the budget under pressure at a time when the world economy is turning down. No doubt the strategy of the Labor Party is to hope that it can spread some of that downturn to Australia and take some political advantage from it.We on this side say it is important in the interests of future Australians to put our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis; it is important to reform expenditures in relation to the welfare system; it is important to change Australia's unfair dismissal laws; it is important to give Australian small business a go so that they can go out and create jobs; and it is important to rein in trade union power, which is threatening many of the Australian manufacturing industries. These are the things that good economic managers are prepared to stand for. These are the things that the coalition will continue to fight for.</DOC>

 - It is certainly not my intention, nor is it the intention of the government, to state the case on behalf of the Australian banks. The Australian banks are very profitable institutions and they can certainly state the case on their own behalf and they can explain their own management decisions. - The only point I would make is that, as far as the economy is concerned, one does not want to have banks which make losses and one does not want to have banks which threaten the financial system. It is certainly the case in relation to other countries - you only have to look at the Japanese financial system. I have often said that banks which make losses are a bigger problem than banks that make profits.An opposition member - That is insightful! - Well, it is insightful, because the last bank that made big losses in Australia was the State Bank of Victoria - owned by a government. One reason why Labor privatised the Commonwealth Bank was that the State Bank of Victoria had failed and they had to find an institution that could take over the bank which had failed. That is the reason why Labor supported privatisation. I must say, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank has been profitable, the Labor policy of privatising the Commonwealth Bank was right. Certainly on this side, we are not arguing that the Labor policy was wrong. It may well be - and I see the heads go down on that side - that they believe their policy was wrong. But on this side, we do not believe it was wrong. - Mr Speaker, that is very relevant because one of the reasons why in Victoria there were so many branch amalgamations and closures was that the whole of the State Bank of Victoria had to be backed into the Commonwealth Bank. - So where you had in a shopping centre a State Bank branch and a Commonwealth Bank branch, once the Labor Party allowed the State Bank of Victoria to go insolvent and the branch moved into the Commonwealth Bank, that meant branch amalgamations and jobs. - As I said before, it certainly is not the policy of this government to argue the merits or demerits of bank decisions. The banks can argue that for themselves. They are very profitable institutions. I welcome one thing that was announced by the Commonwealth Bank today - that it will keep branch numbers at the current level as of today. This is bearing in mind there have been massive closures, particularly in Victoria - some of which, I understand, are because of the failure of the State Bank of Victoria. That is an indication that it will not be closing further branches, and that is something that I certainly welcome and I imagine many of the bank's customers also welcome. Obviously there was a time for a big restructure with the failure of the State Bank of Victoria; that has passed. - I welcome the fact that the Commonwealth Bank has now indicated that it will not be closing any more branches. I think the people of Australia will welcome that and, if I may say so, that was a proper decision for the bank to take in the circumstances.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I also thank him for his commitment to job creation in the Victorian manufacturing industry. The motor industry is very important to Australia's future because it probably is still the very heart of the manufacturing sector in this country. Thanks to a lot of good work by governments and by people in the industry it has been enjoying something of a renaissance over the last decade with production up quite strongly and, in particular, with exports growing from almost nothing to more than $5 billion a year now. Unfortunately, three times in the last 12 months it has been brought to the brink of standstill by the activities of ultramilitant unions. Just to give one example, let me quote the comments of an AMWU organiser to the Age, who said:The delegates will be putting a devious little plot together to stuff up production ... causing maximum disruption to the company but minimum loss of pay to workers ...That organiser was no maverick. No less a person than the assistant secretary of the AMWU has threatened to paralyse no fewer than 500 component manufacturers as enterprise bargaining negotiations begin over the next few months. It is interesting; there was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was actually against strikes. When he was a union leader he said:There is no doubt that the public is put offside by strike action. It is better that trade unions do something positive.Unfortunately, he has gone backward over the years and now he never sees a strike that he does not support. I think it is fair to say that, in translating the member for Hotham from the leadership of the trade union movement to the leadership of the parliamentary Labor Party, the quality of both institutions has deteriorated. Even if he did want to criticise the AMWU, he could not afford to because the AMWU has given no less than $3 million over the last six years to the Labor Party and it controls the biggest single block vote in the Victorian Labor conference - the Leader of the Opposition's home state.  - Speaking of the motor industry, the situation is just going to get worse because under the Hawke-Wran reforms the union block vote is increasing from zero per cent to 50 per cent at Labor's national conference. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is shaking his head -  - The situation in the motor industry is likely to deteriorate further as the AMWU gets even more influence and it will get more influence under the Hawke-Wran reforms. The Leader of the Opposition shakes his head when I say that the union block vote at the national conference will increase from zero per cent to 50 per cent. He shakes his head. Let me quote. - Let me quote for the benefit of the House from the Hawke-Wran summary of recommendations. Recommendation 1.3 states:The number of delegates representing unions at the National Conference shall be consistent with the equal partnership reflected in this Report and in the result shall be consistent with changes to the ratio of delegates that we have recommended for State Conferences. - To tackle the kinds of problems that we are seeing in the motor industry, because of the ultramilitant unions supported by members opposite, we have a bill before the Senate. It is the genuine bargaining bill. I say to members opposite, in particular to the Leader of the Opposition, that if the Leader of the Opposition wants to demonstrate that he has changed, if he wants to demonstrate that he is not a prisoner of his past, that he is bigger than his background, that he is not a trade union official out of his depth, he would tell his colleagues in the Senate to support the government's genuine bargaining bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his surprising question. Prior to the work done by Tim Besley in the first inquiry, the Labor Party went down the road of seeking to discredit Tim Besley and that process of inquiry - you know, smear anybody with anything that comes to hand and -  - and seek to imply at all turns that the inquiry therefore would not be -  - rigorous and would not be independent and would not have the necessary substance. Of course the Besley inquiry proved all of the critics wrong. It called it as it was. The government has responded in a very appropriate and I think far reaching way. Of the some 17 points we made in response to the Besley inquiry, 12 or 13 are now either complete or very substantially complete; the others are on track. It is time to have a look again. In view of the fact that Tim Besley is regrettably not available, for understandable reasons, to continue his work we wanted somebody who will do exactly what Mr Besley did, which is call it exactly as it is.</DOC>

 - I am delighted that members opposite -  - are also interested in the significant contribution that this government is making towards protecting our environment. It is especially appropriate that the member for Indi should ask this question on this day, because this is National Landcare Week. This is a week in which we pay tribute to the enormous efforts of volunteers right across the nation who care for our environment in a very practical way. Tonight, the Prime Minister will be hosting the national Landcare awards in this building. The Deputy Prime Minister and others will be there as well. Awards will be presented to people who have made a particular contribution and to local groups which have undertaken projects of particular benefit to our environment.Landcare is an extraordinary community organisation. It is unique to Australia. Other countries around the world are seeking to implement similar models. It is a classic example of Australians working together at the local level to achieve worthwhile outcomes. These people care about the environment. They do not just climb up on rooftops or complain about it; they actually get into it and do something. They act and deliver results. There is no doubt that every community in Australia has benefited from the activities of their Landcare groups over recent years. The Landcare ethos that has developed, particularly in rural and regional Australia, has helped to motivate the whole nation towards caring about our environment and addressing issues of local concern. This is not just about identifying problems; it is about actually getting on with the job.This government has been more than pleased to provide financial support to make Landcare work. At successive elections, we heard that the Labor Party were going to wind back financial support to the Natural Heritage Trust and to Landcare work. That demonstrates their lack of concern for and lack of appreciation of the enormous effort that communities have put into caring for the environment. Contrast that with the $2.5 billion commitment we have made to the Natural Heritage Trust. And now, in cooperation with the states, there is $1.4 billion going towards salinity and water quality issues. Already $50 million has been allocated under that plan - $15 million to South Australia, $18 million to Victoria, $16 million to Queensland and half a million dollars to Tasmania so that regionally driven, worthwhile projects can deliver results at the local level. The Landcare movement has one of the most extensive memberships of any organisation in the country. Volunteers work remarkably well together locally, supported by a federal government that cares about environmental issues. It is appropriate that we honour those volunteers this week in National Landcare Week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. He joins a long list of members of this parliament - the member for Leichhardt, the member for Dawson, the member for Hinkler and others - who are concerned about the state of the sugar industry. I can assure the House that, in considering the requests that have been put to us by the sugar industry, we will examine all of the options. - The Leader of the Opposition finds the plight of the sugar industry amusing, does he?  - He does. You get asked a serious question by somebody -  - who has a concern about this -  - and the Leader of the Opposition treats it in a `once over lightly' cavalier fashion. To return to an issue that people are concerned about on this side of the parliament, there are a number of proposals that have been put to the government. The industry is in a very difficult state. I do not share in full the analysis of the reasons given by the member for Kennedy; I do not think the tariff abolition really is the reason. When you bear in mind the relationship between the world price and the domestic price of sugar at the time that decision was taken, I think that rather disproves the proposition that it was the abolition of the tariff that has created the problem.  There is a massive oversupply of sugar. The world price is very depressed. The industry is important to many regional cities, particularly along the Queensland coast. In the past, the government have been very sympathetic. We gave a very significant rescue package several years ago, and I have to say that the structural reform in the industry that followed that package was not as much as we expected at the time. We are prepared to provide additional assistance to the industry, but it will, in general terms, only be on the condition that serious restructuring is under way. If that is not assured, then the assistance cannot be made available. The problem with the industry is obvious: there are too many small holdings. There will be some who will have to leave the industry. One of the propositions that we will consider is the possibility of a levy. I think the levy worked effectively in relation to the dairy industry restructuring and I have not ruled that out. I am not saying we are going to do it, but I am certainly not going to rule it out.In making a decision on this issue, we have to obtain from the industry an understanding that, as well as being a recipient of assistance, the industry has to be a significant part of the solution. On that basis, let me assure all members in this parliament, particularly the coalition sugar industry task force, that I and the senior members of the government - the Deputy Prime Minister in particular - are very concerned about the industry. We do not want the people of Queensland to lose the critical economic and social mass of the industry which has contributed to many coastal towns in Queensland and northern New South Wales.In very difficult world circumstances where there is a massive oversupply and dreadful prices, there will have to be some major restructuring, there will have to be a bit of lateral thinking and there will have to be solutions that have never been embraced before. The government is not interested in just another bandaid response which will mean that in a couple of years the industry is back asking for more assistance. We need a more radical, lasting solution if government help is to be forthcoming.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. I know he maintains a very active interest in this area of Kyoto and it is fair to say that he is one of the biggest supporters in this House of the government's position on Kyoto. The inaugural government-business climate change dialogue was held a few hours ago and was attended by both the environment minister and me. That dialogue has set the way to identify and deliver long-term solutions on greenhouse.Greenhouse is a global issue and requires global solutions. In terms of industry's role in that, industry today accepted that it has to be part of those global solutions but in turn has asked this government to ensure, as we proceed in partnership, that the costs of greenhouse reduction are shared globally - that is, that the competitiveness of Australia's industries is not compromised, nor is our ability to provide jobs.In doing so, industry is mindful today - as is government - that simplistic solutions will not deliver answers to long-term greenhouse reduction. What industry is desiring and what government has committed to work with them on is the delivery of long-term consistency in greenhouse policy in Australia, both at a state and federal level. Industry is asking that we deliver an incentive and market based system, not a punitive system. By building a framework together, I am confident that this government and industry in Australia will deliver reductions in greenhouse gas that will be for the good of the whole globe.In terms of industries in Australia, they are already taking advantage of the $1 billion provided particularly by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for greenhouse programs. These will provide an annual saving of some 60 million tonnes of CO2 and greenhouse gases by the end of this decade. In fact, that is equivalent to taking all of the cars in Australia off the road. In the aluminium industry, for instance, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of aluminium produced is about 45 per cent.In talking of today's dialogue, it is important that we also hear from the participants from the industry side. For instance, Brian Horwood from the Minerals Council said, `The government is putting its money where its mouth is to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.' Ollie Clark from the Australian Gas Association praised the government for its `commonsense approach on the greenhouse issue'. What is the alternative? While the government progresses in partnership with industry to reduce global greenhouse gases, Labor's promise to ratify the Kyoto agreement will simply cost jobs in industry in Australia. - The member for Hunter knows that and so does the member for Paterson.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and his continuing great interest in science, especially as chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation. His attendance at last night's dinner, together with several other members of the House, is much appreciated. After all, last night was an opportunity to celebrate the outstanding careers of three leading Australian scientists. The Prime Minister presented the 2002 Prime Minister's Prize for Science to Professor Frank Fenner, a universally popular choice. Professor Fenner has had a long and distinguished career. He is regarded as a pioneer in his field of virology and as Australia's most distinguished living microbiologist. Throughout his career, Professor Fenner became internationally renowned for his work in two vitally important areas: myxomatosis and smallpox. I should add that Professor Fenner remains actively involved in the science community at the tender age of 87. He has mentored and inspired successive generations of Australian scientists to follow in his footsteps. He continues to do so on a daily basis.At the other end of the age spectrum, prizes were presented to two of Australia's most promising young researchers. The Science Minister's Prize for the Life Scientist of the Year was awarded to Dr Joel Mackay of the University of Sydney. Dr Mackay's work has led to a better understanding of the way in which genetic information is regulated and read out in living organisms - a development which could lead to cures for cancer in the future. The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for the Physical Scientist of the Year was awarded to Professor Marcela Bilek, also from the University of Sydney, for her substantial contributions in the fields of plasma physics and the physics of materials. These two young scientists represent the best of the new generation, and the awards reflect the government's commitment to encouraging our best talent to pursue careers in research.We are quick - over-quick at times - to provide accolades for our entertainment and sports heroes, but, as the Prime Minister himself remarked last night, our leaders in science and innovation make an even greater contribution to our daily lives. It is very fitting that these awards were presented last night, in the middle of National Science Week. Throughout Australia, the government is supporting and encouraging schools, science communicators, community groups and volunteers as they take part in more than a thousand official events and school activities. Last night - and National Science Week - provided an opportunity to honour the achievements of all Australian scientists, not just those who take out the major awards.While I am sure the House joins me in congratulating all the prize winners on their achievements, I would also like to congratulate their support teams, who are leading the way in so many areas of science and innovation in the country. Frank Fenner, Marcela Bilek and Joel Mackay all made this point last night. They are representatives of the research teams who collectively go to make Australian science the basis of the nation's prosperity. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In June, Lieutenant General Des Mueller, the Vice Chief of Defence Force from 2000 to 2002, circulated a report to senior defence and ADF officers on his reflections on his two years in office. I would have thought that the conduct of the ADF in recent deployments in East Timor and Afghanistan was proof enough of the professionalism and the effectiveness of the ADF and of the broader defence organisation. Defence has already acknowledged some of the deficiencies identified by the general, including the need to improve information flows within the department, within the ADF and with government, and is making improvements. The suggestion that a chief of staff work with the Chief of Defence Force has already been canvassed by the secretary and the CDF task force. This is also to assist with communications in Defence and exploring ways of establishing such a function. Defence financial management practices and the management of platforms have been undergoing substantial reform, and this continues to be a high priority for the defence leadership. I think that the proof effectively is in the delivery. We can honestly say, `Look at four words', and they are East Timor and Afghanistan. - `East Timor and Afghanistan' are four words. - Australia has a Defence Force that is recognised internationally as the very best. They have played strong, done good and they have done Australia proud.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his keen interest in families, like all members on this side of the House.  - I was delighted to be in his electorate out at Narromine the other day when we went and viewed the Rivergum Childcare Centre, which was opened because of the policies of the coalition government. - Just briefly, there are some very big macro things that this government has done when it comes to the welfare of families. - There are a number of very major achievements that this government has been responsible for, when it comes to the welfare of families. They are extremely low mortgage rates, the pay rises and tax cuts families have had over the last couple of years and very strong employment growth. These are three critical ingredients for helping Australian families. At the micro level, the family tax benefit has been a great success for this government. I want to reiterate what I said yesterday: there is $2 billion extra going to two million families, helping nearly four million Australian children.When it comes to child care, the record is outstanding. If anything, this is a signature project for the Howard-Anderson government. We are spending 70 per cent more on child care today than Labor ever did. We invested over $1.6 billion in child care last year alone. What we are seeing is that there are more children using child care today than there ever have been in Australia's history - 720,000. There are 190,000 extra places and there have been 2,000 more services built, along with a reduction in cost - a nine per cent fall in the cost of child care over the last two years. There is no question that child care under this government has been enormously beneficial for families. If you add child care, family tax benefit and parenting payment, it comes to over $18 billion that is going out in assisting Australian families, not to mention the baby bonus and the measure announced yesterday: a vaccine for meningococcal disease type C, which is very important for Australian kids. The member did ask, in a very poignant part of his question: do the opposition have any alternative policies? I have to say that they have a dismal record. The facts are that they spent 40 per cent less on the welfare of Australian families when they were in government in the last six years than we with our outstanding record have done. They gave Australian families two recessions, record unemployment and record interest rates, and they left a legacy to our children of $80 billion in Commonwealth debt.It is interesting that the rhetoric now has almost become comical. We saw yesterday that the tactics used, certainly by the member for Lilley, are scare tactics. We saw those used when he was trying to introduce an individual case into the parliament relating to the family tax benefit. It is interesting in that I asked Senator Vanstone whether she had heard from the member for Lilley, because we have an interest in following through with cases. We did not hear from the member for Lilley. We made an inquiry and he refused to give us the information. He said, `Oh, I have to go and contact the family.' He was quite happy to give the information in the Australian parliament, which just goes to demonstrate that you are more interested in scaring people in a stunt than you are in their actual welfare. - I would just like to repeat what was stated by a member of the opposition, obviously talking to Laurie: `Everyone is saying the PM is taking the lead on work and family.' This alleged supporter of the Leader of the Opposition went on to say, `Good grief, what's going on here?' I will tell you what is going on here: it is this government, it is this Prime Minister and this Deputy Prime Minister that are promoting family policy. But this does beg the question: I wonder who the person is who is undermining his leader? You can run, but you cannot hide under a lily! - I wonder. The only family they are interested in is the trade union family - and what a shambles that is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I said yesterday and Senator Hill repeated today, a request was made of the government by a member of the coalition during a party room meeting yesterday for a briefing on the issue of Iraq. Both Senator Hill and I are happy to facilitate such a briefing. We also said to the media, both yesterday and today, that if the members of the Labor Party caucus would like a briefing, I would obviously be happy to provide one for them. I think the Prime Minister has very effectively answered these questions in relation to a prime ministerial statement. But I am not aware of Tony Blair having made a statement to the British House of Commons with an ensuing debate, or Jean Chretien likewise in Canada. It may have been the case, but I am not aware of those prime ministers having done so and instituted a debate at this stage.There are obviously many forms of the House that could be used to institute discussion on these issues if the opposition wishes to pursue this; it is an option for them, of course. Alternatively, as the Prime Minister has made clear and I have made clear, we are happy to have not just one debate but several debates at an appropriate time to talk about this issue. It will not be happening in the next two weeks because we think it is premature. To be frank, I think the Prime Minister's argument that it would be premature is entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and note that I was delighted to be able to visit a number of aged care facilities in his electorate over the recent weeks. As the member alluded to, earlier this year I asked the Department of Health and Ageing to review each and every provisional aged care allocation over the two years afforded in the legislation to determine progress being made in those beds becoming operational. One of the government's major priorities in aged care has been to ensure that beds are brought online as soon as possible to ensure that older Australians who require residential aged care are able to access it.All providers with provisionally allocated beds are now required to report on progress towards bringing new places online on a quarterly basis with a view to making them operational as soon as possible. The review undertaken by the department revealed, as I indicated to the House in April, that there were 2,816 outstanding beds that had been allocated for more than the two years under the legislation. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that of these 829 have become operational since that announcement, 68 have been revoked, a further 59 have been surrendered and some 1,211 will become operational this financial year.Following on from that review of the pre-2000 provisional allocations, the department is now reviewing places allocated in the 2000 aged care approvals round that are still outstanding. I can also report to the House that a total of 1,580 provisionally allocated aged care beds have become operational in the last six months. This is in part due to the government's determination to send a strong message to providers that the community expects that these places will be brought into operation as soon as possible.Indeed, since the coalition came to government in 1996 over 49,000 aged care places have been released to meet the needs of older Australians and there are now 169,000 operational places nationally. In May this year I released another 8,231 new aged care places to meet the needs of older Australians requiring aged care, and we are committed to achieving a target of 200,000 aged care places by 2006. This will restore the balance in aged care provision by continuing to make up for the 10,000-bed shortfall in aged care places which we inherited from the Labor Party. </DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question, obviously, is no. - This is yet another opportunistic intervention, as we would expect from the Leader of the Opposition. - The law is that proceeds of crime are taxable, and the government certainly supports all proceeds of crime being taxable. In fact, the Australian Taxation Office has sought to establish that point both in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and in the Federal Court. I have encouraged the Australian Taxation Office to appeal the decision to the full Federal Court in the hope that, upon appeal, the court will take a different view. As far as the government is concerned, the full proceeds of crime should be taxable and should be treated as income and, as far as the government is concerned, if, after the appeal process is exhausted, that requires legislative amendment, the government will certainly be very favourably disposed to ensuring that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I am aware - and I think all members of the House would be aware - of the announcement made by the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr David Murray, that the bank intends to scrap its executive share option scheme. This is precisely the kind of corporate action that I had in mind when, just over two weeks ago, I addressed a meeting of the Securities Institute and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Sydney. It is not appropriate that parliaments legislate away the rights of companies to have share option schemes if they so choose. But, given the abuse that has occurred and given some of the concerns that have been expressed, I think it is entirely appropriate that companies take the lead, and I congratulate John Ralph, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank. Not for the first time, he has shown the lead to corporate Australia, and I hope the lead that Mr Ralph and his fellow directors have shown on this occasion will be picked up by other companies around Australia.I should note in passing that, while the Corporations Act already requires the details of executive options be disclosed in directors' reports, the Australian Accounting Standards Board is currently developing an accounting standard on the issue, including on how options should be valued. The International Accounting Standards Board is also working on a new standard which would require companies to expense stock options granted as remuneration. I also noted with some interest last Thursday the release by the ASX Corporate Governance Council of its directions on governance and best practice to listed companies. What this amounts to is a very obvious response by the business community in Australia to the call that I and others have made for a lifting of the standards of corporate governance. The reality is that we have a choice. We can, à la the Labor Party, dump a whole lot of additional regulation on honest business operators in this country, to the detriment of the operation of our economy or, alternatively, we can do as the government has done and give a lead. I am delighted that people of the prominence in the business community of John Ralph and David Murray, leading the Commonwealth Bank, have responded to that and are giving an example to other company executives around Australia of the need for greater self-regulation. As I said in that speech some 2½ weeks ago, if business does not respond with greater self-regulation, then inevitably governments will end up dumping unnecessary, additional regulation on them. What I think is pleasing from the action taken by the Commonwealth Bank today is that that message is being received in corporate Australia, and I congratulate John Ralph and David Murray on the lead that they have taken.</DOC>

 - Because this government does both: we propose not only to tax it but to confiscate it. In fact, Senator Christopher Ellison introduced the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 in March 2002 -  - So you are against taxing it, are you? The Leader of the Opposition just interjected, `How can you do both?' In other words, he is against taxing the proceeds of crime. You can do both and it is certainly our proposition to do both. You said, `Why not follow Labor in confiscating?' and then said, `How can you do both?' In other words, how could you tax as well? So the Labor Party was against doing both, Mr Speaker.  - `Oh!' he says. Too clever an interjection by half, as the Hansard will record. He said, `How can you do both?' The answer is: you can do both. You can do both because you can tax the proceeds of crime, which they can pay out of other income which they may have lawfully, and you can confiscate the proceeds as well. That is this government's position, a much tougher position than the Labor Party's position - as comes out of the mouths of babes and knaves with the interjection that he just made. Senator Christopher Ellison introduced the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2002 on 13 March 2002. We call on the Labor Party to support us. We also support taxing the proceeds of crime -  - and call on the Australian Labor Party to stand up and take back the interjection he just made and indicate -  - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. A fortnight ago, Commissioner Cole recommended the establishment of a task force to investigate and prosecute illegalities in the construction industry. I repeat to the House that the government has accepted that recommendation and will move to establish a task force operating under existing law to become operational by the end of next month.It is important to move quickly to ensure that both construction management and construction unions operate under the rule of law. That is why the government has accepted Commissioner Cole's recommendation for a specialist body to be set up urgently, rather than wait for a new body covering wider matters to be established. It is interesting that both Commissioner Cole's recommendation and the government's response have been widely welcomed. I quote from the editorial in today's Financial Review:Terence Cole ... is showing a lively appreciation of the traps that have snared previous would-be reformers of this important but difficult industry.Today's Age editorial says:Honest and fair dealing in the building industry is a goal worth pursuing. The decision to set up an interim taskforce along the lines suggested by Justice Cole is a good one.I should note that the member for Barton and shadow minister for workplace relations has acknowledged the need for effective law enforcement in this industry. I note and indeed welcome the statement of the Leader of the Opposition earlier this week to the Australian Industry Group, when he said:I think that any system requires tough rules. I do not condone crooks wherever they are from. If there are implications out of the royal commission that point to crookedness and corruption, the full force of the law should be brought against them.I welcome those statements. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton and I look forward to their support for the very important work of this task force.</DOC>

 - In answer to that question, I would have thought that in the few questions that have been asked this week on this matter many very clear expositions have been made of the government's position. I note - and the House might be amused to hear this - that on 23 July on radio 3AW, when talking to Stan Zemanak, the member for Griffith said, `We can't afford to appease Iraq.' They were his words. I can only say that, using language like that, the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs uses language to mean that he does not believe the United Nations Security Council, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and others should back down in their attempts to ensure Security Council resolutions are adhered to and, further than that, that any weapons of mass destruction capability that Iraq has will forthwith be destroyed.I think that has to be the thrust, and obviously it is the thrust, of international diplomacy in order to try to resolve this matter in a peaceful way. Nevertheless, as the government has said on many occasions, whilst we very much hope that this is resolved in a peaceful way, the onus for it to be resolved in a peaceful way above all falls on Saddam Hussein and Iraqi leadership. It is very important that the international community maintain strong pressure on the Iraqis. - The notes from which I was quoting are confidential. I do not have the transcript with me but, to do justice to the honourable member for Griffith, I am very happy to make available the transcript, which is in my office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that today, further to its election commitment, the government has released a review of international taxation arrangements, for consultation with the business community, on making Australia's tax system internationally competitive for those Australian companies seeking to do business outside Australia or to bring new investment into this country. These proposals build on what the government has already achieved in relation to a competitive business tax regime: bringing the company tax rate down to 30 per cent, abolishing wholesale sales taxes and taxes on exports, introducing the goods and services tax, halving capital gains tax for individuals, introducing rollovers to allow scrip for scrip rollover and rollover for small business from one business to another, and negotiating changes to the Australia-US tax treaty in late 2001.The consultation paper looks particularly at whether the tax on overseas earnings of Australian companies could be alleviated by giving credit for dividend withholding taxes. It looks at improving Australia's attractiveness as a location for internationally focused companies by examining the question of conduit income. It proposes modernising our tax treaties with other countries overseas, and it looks also at controlled foreign companies and foreign investment fund rules.Many Australian companies are now going out into the world and seeking to do business on behalf of their employees and their shareholders and bringing income back through the Australian taxation system. We want our tax system to have integrity, but we want it to be internationally competitive. Reforming our Australian taxation system will make for a stronger economy. A stronger economy means more jobs for Australians and more job opportunities for younger Australians in an economy which is internationally attractive. We do not want a situation where Australian companies feel that, for tax reasons, they must move overseas.The government's Board of Taxation will be looking at the consultation process, and it will be making recommendations back to the government. We hope to be in a position to produce legislation next year. The important work of government in improving Australia's taxation system will continue under the leadership of this government, which has brought Australia forward but wants to make Australia even more internationally competitive.</DOC>

I can speak for myself: I have made no undertakings to the Australian Wheat Board or to the Iraqi government that Australia will modify its position. Since you ask the question, I will be meeting with the Australian Wheat Board this afternoon -  - The Prime Minister is meeting with them as well. We will be making it clear to the Australian Wheat Board that the government have a clear position on the issue of Iraq and that we are standing by our position.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. In this year's budget, the government announced the `More doctors for outer metropolitan areas' measure, which is aimed at increasing the number of general practitioners and doctors who practise in the outer metropolitan areas of the six state capital cities. This measure entails a commitment of expenditure of some $80 million over four years, which will bring about an increase of about 150 practising doctors in outer metropolitan areas.The scheme, which is scheduled to start on 1 January next year, involves three specific parts. First, it allows specialist trainees and researchers to work in supervised general practice programs and trainees to work after hours. Second, it requires doctors undertaking the general stream of general practice training to train in designated outer metropolitan areas. Third, it allows selected other medical practitioners who undertake vocational registration programs and agree to work in designated outer metropolitan areas to become eligible for higher Medicare rebates.The honourable member for Macarthur asked how this scheme would be of advantage to his electorate. Indeed, the announcement of this scheme and the implementation of it in the coming months are extremely timely for the honourable member's electorate. Earlier this year, at very short notice, the local doctor in the township of Bringelly - which has a population of about 2,000 people and a surrounding population of some 4,500 people - left the township. The member for Macarthur, in association with other residents of that township and the area,has been working to ensure that general practice is provided to the residents of Bringelly. So I am happy to be able to indicate to the honourable member today that the Minister for Health and Ageing has asked the department to fast-track this scheme, particularly in relation to doctors who undertake work in outer metropolitan areas, and to bring it online, if at all possible, sooner than 1 January next year.I notice that the shadow minister for health acknowledged recently that it is only targeted measures like this - targeted measures towards regional and rural areas of Australia - that bring about an improvement as far as health is concerned. The targeted measures that this government has implemented have been successful. For example, if one looks at the number of general practitioners in rural and regional Australia, in the three years from 1997 to 2000 there was an increase in the numbers from 5,700 to 6,363. That sort of substantial increase is because of the measures undertaken by this government to ensure that health services flow to all Australians, and we are confident that this measure for outer metropolitan regions of our capital cities will also bring about an improvement in doctor services for people in those areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because it gives me the opportunity to remind him of the legislation passed 25 years ago - as I recollect, by a Labor government - that is, of course, very seminal to the particular circumstance he raises. The coastal licence provisions, contained in part VI of the Navigation Act 1912, provide an appropriate balance between the interests of ship operators and shippers. They have remained unchanged for at least the past 25 years and were in place during Labor's term of government.The circumstances are grossly exaggerated and silly. The fundamentals are that the arrangements continue for people to obtain work for Australian based shipping. But the continued availability of safe and internationally competitive shipping - which is crucial to retaining export markets - assists local producers to be competitive against imports and removes an obstacle to increasing value-adding commodity processing. This is the point where I say the final words of the shadow minister were silly: foreign ships are only permitted to carry coastal cargoes in circumstances where Australian licensed vessels are not available. That in itself is the fundamental point. If the vessels are available, the licences will not be issued; if they are not available, they will be issued. So people working on the land - for instance, construction workers needing cement - and others of that nature can gain necessary employment by provision of the products they need to engage in employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his support for small business and for his question. This week the Labor Party stopped the government's attempt to protect small business from union thuggery by opposing our changes to the Trade Practices Act. We wanted to give the ACCC the power to protect small businesses who were the innocent victims of secondary boycotts, and the Labor Party wants to give more power to the unions at a cost to small business. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has publicly declared that this decision by the Labor Party in the Senate is `a blow to the job creating small business sector'. That is because 1.2 million Australian small businesses now employ around half of the Australian private sector work force. It also represents about one-third of the entire Australian economy.I suppose it should not come as a surprise that Labor senators have chosen to put the unions ahead of Australia's small businesses. Of the 28 Labor senators, 90 per cent are former trade union officials or Labor staffers and not one has ever owned a small business. In fact, we cannot find any Labor senator who has ever worked in a small business. As members of the House will recall, before 1 July there was one - Senator Barney Cooney. We on this side of the House miss Barney - good old Barney. On 1 July, as Senator Barney Cooney was jumping onto his horse and riding off into the sunset like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti western, in comes Senator Gavin Marshall. From the other end of town, in comes Senator Gavin Marshall. In fact, Senator Gavin Marshall voted down our small business protection bill. - Very interesting. We did not know why Senator Marshall put this forward, but we found out in a speech yesterday when he said:Australian unions and unionists are part of the moral bedrock of this country ...Are they the morals of Craig Johnston, the AMWU boss who was charged last year with riot, affray, criminal damage and aggravated burglary and now faces sexual charges? - Senator Marshall also claimed that the moral bedrock of the Labor Party and the moral bedrock of Australia is the association with the Labor Party and the union movement. This is the same Senator Marshall who in the 1990s was involved with the Electrical Trades Union, was responsible for wildcat strikes to Victoria's transport system and switched off the power to support his comrades in the transport unions. So the same guy who was turning off the electricity to support the transport workers now comes into the Senate and votes down protection for small business in favour of his union mates. Perhaps the most revealing comment about this came yesterday from the new State Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Dean Mighell - who might be called a high priest or moral bedrock. - He said:I think it is offensive and arrogant the way that federal politicians - read this, Simon - in particular those who have climbed the stairway of trade unions and leapt into federal parliament sit on high and say, `How relevant are the unions?' I am not going to sit back as if we are some failed outfit that is irrelevant. I think we are relevant. They - that is you, Simon - need to understand -  - Mr Speaker, perhaps the most telling line from the State Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union -  -  - in relation to the comments of Senator Marshall is:They - meaning the Labor Party - need to understand if you are looking at us, well, we are looking at you too.No wonder Labor senators put the unions ahead of small business in relation to this. With a pioneer Lucifer as their moral bedrock - </DOC>

But, if this is going to happen, it is very important that our crews and our ships are competitive - very important. The problem is that, at the moment, because of restrictive work practices -  - such as the notorious six weeks on, six weeks off rule and the unwillingness of Australian crews to perform any maintenance whatsoever - they will not even perform routine maintenance - Australian crews are close to double the cost of comparable OECD crews. I am all in favour of greater Australian employment in the maritime industry. - I would like to see greater Australian employment in the maritime industry, but that means an end to these - An opposition member - That was an unimpressive answer! - I have, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his ultra-excellent question. I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that the strike rate in Australia has halved since 1996 when this government came to power. Strikes are still at the lowest levels since records were first kept in 1913, thanks mostly to this government's constant encouragement of workplace level bargaining. This is very good news for our economy, but it is particularly good news for workers because strikes cost jobs, strikes send businesses bankrupt and strikes stop investment in new industries. The real victims of strikes are shop floor workers who are often hundreds of dollars out of pocket to support the political agendas of union officials whose pay packets are not at risk.These days it seems that most strikes are about politics not pay. For instance, back in May a strike over the protection of long service leave all but paralysed the motor industry even though long service leave is protected under the government's entitlements scheme. Earlier this month 1,000 building workers went on strike because they did not agree with their employer's submission to the royal commission. Right now, I understand that there is an enterprise in Melbourne which is being picketed by some 500 metal workers in support of a sacked worker. I understand that at this enterprise 20 workers have been stood down because they are supporting the picket line. You might ask, Mr Speaker, who is this evil boss; who is this bad boss who has done this terrible thing? It is none other than Dougie Cameron, who is sacking people because they are on the wrong side of a faction fight! This is the moral bedrock of Australia, sacking people because they are on the wrong side of a faction fight. The government's genuine bargaining bill is designed to tackle some of the job-destroying consequences of industrial action. The genuine bargaining bill is likely to be blocked in the Senate. I fear that the opposition's intransigence is only going to get worse as union influence increases. Unfortunately, under the Hawke-Wran proposals, the union block vote at national conferences will increase from zero per cent to 50 per cent. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to demonstrate that he is a real leader, that he can transcend his past and that he is bigger than his background, he would instruct his union mates in the Senate to pass the genuine bargaining bill.</DOC>

 - I am very grateful that the member for Corio has been reading my speeches because it shows he has some interest. If he reads them for long enough, he might even get some ideas. - Further, it is quite obvious why the previous minister for education in our government thought it was time to have some literacy testing, because in his attempt to read those speeches, the member for Corio starts to put his own words into the actual subject. - In referring to the most vigorous practices of my activities, the fact of life is that the words I used were that in getting a better deal for local government I would be prepared to use iron bar principles. I stand by that with great pride, because this side of government believes in local government and is very conscious of the huge workload it takes on today on behalf of its ratepayers. Mr Speaker, one of the other issues on which the member for Corio might have extended his reading was to read the weekend Advertiser in your great state, I think on the fourth of this month, where there was a report of the submission to the inquiry into cost-shifting being conducted by a standing committee of this parliament in which the Police Association of South Australia, consistent, I believe -  - with the view of their national body, have said that they would greatly support and promote a local government police force, which, of course, the member for Corio referred to as some sort of stupid idea. When you have no ideas, everybody's ideas do not look very good. The realities then go to a very serious issue on which I wish to conclude - that is, what has been going on for about eight years in Queensland. Year after year, the Queensland government and its Commonwealth grants distribution body have been requesting a series of ministers from both sides of the parliament to give them a section 26 dispensation because their distributions are not consistent with the Keating government's national principles on the distribution of funding. That is not going to continue. But to meet a circumstance that has arisen - because I got the same letter again this year: `We'll fix it in the next 12 months' - I have issued a section 26 order for two of the four quotas of moneys which, by the way, are dramatically increased this year. In doing that, I have said that the grants commission newly appointed in Queensland has got to do the right thing. By doing that, some very large councils will get some lesser grants and some very small ones will get some greater grants, but the Commonwealth's contribution will be 100 cents in the dollar and the people -  -  - Somebody thinks it is funny that we should ensure that all the money goes and that some little councils are going to get more. Finally, I was interjected upon in relation to land grants in -  - You have done no reading: that is your problem. The government, consistent with its policies on land ownership, is currently finalising negotiations on Norfolk Island to give current day leaseholders, the principal number of whom are of Pitcairn Island descent, private ownership, freehold ownership of their land. I said of those who criticise that practice that they would propose government ownership of land - clearly the view of our opponents here today - and that is a communist principle. I stand by what I said.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and acknowledge his keen interest and that of his electorate in the international business that is being undertaken by Australia's exporters, particularly from the rural sector. Over the duration that our government has been in office, we have seen a significant improvement in the economic circumstances in Australia that have been fundamentally brought about by the reform processes that we have introduced as a government, and business recognises that. Exports have delivered Australia export income of about $154 billion dollars in the last year, up from $99 billion when we came into office. This government's reforms have seen interest rates come down to around 6.5 per cent - reforms that have seen much lower inflation compared to under Labor, reforms that have seen us pay off $60 billion worth of Labor's public sector debt and, most importantly, reforms that have seen unemployment drop to the low rate of 6.2 per cent and have seen 970,000-plus jobs created across Australia in the Australian economy, real jobs created by the private sector.This government has created an economic and trading environment that is great for business. We have seen over 400 international companies set up their headquarters in Australia, doing business from here into the Asia-Pacific region. This is a direct result of having one of the best run and fastest growing economies in the developed world. It has enabled Australian businesses to launch themselves into the international marketplace and for Australian businesses to start buying back icon products. We have seen many Australians complain about the loss of icon products out of Australia over the years. Last week I had the honour of participating in the announcement by an Australian company that they had purchased back from offshore, foreign ownership, a great Australian food brand icon - that is, Rosella. Rosella has been owned by foreigners for the last 40 years and it has been bought back by a company called Stuart Alexander and now has Australian ownership.It is also enabling Australian companies to purchase companies offshore, buy icon products offshore, bring the intellectual property back into Australia and generate jobs in Australia. I will give you a classic example. The company Compumedics - who were in fact a 2001 Australian export award winner - are a small to medium enterprise manufacturing specialist products to combat sleep disorder. They export their products into Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia, Europe and the USA. They have recently bought a US medical technology company who also manufacture similar equipment. They are going to bring all the intellectual property from that company back into Australia and generate jobs in Australia.We have often complained in Australia about the brain drain out of this country. Here there is a brain gain that is coming back into Australia, and it is all because these Australian businesses are operating in a very competitive and efficient economic environment because of the reforms that our government has been prepared to undertake. I might add that they are reforms that have been opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. They cannot point to one reform that has delivered benefit to our economy that they have supported. They are still opposing reforms in the Senate as we speak. That is to their detriment and it is to the detriment of the Australian Labor Party in the eyes of the public. There is a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition to prove Laurie Oakes wrong in his article this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because it is a very useful question. The information that I provided to the parliament the other day - which the honourable member had noted - was that 60 per cent of people who had been refused protection in Australia and are in the community had not left. I made the observation that that was a considerably better outcome than was being achieved in most other countries in the world. - No, and the reasons are very clear. A substantial proportion of those people are on visas. The larger proportion of those visas that they have - I think about 17 per cent of the total number - are bridging visas. Why are they on bridging visas? Because we had the manipulation of the legal system over a period of time by people who were able to join class actions, which we were only able to have discontinued, with your reluctant support, at the end of the last parliament. - Let me just make the point. There are reasons why a proportion of them remain lawfully in Australia on bridging visas because of the extent to which they are able to manipulate the legal system. There are some others - and let me make this very clear - where, in response to requests that I even have from members of parliament on your side of the House, I intervene to enable them to remain in Australia. They may have married an Australian or they may be in a relationship with an Australian, and there may be other reasons of hardship which suggest that it would be inappropriate to ask them to go abroad and apply to come back. We have done considerably better than most other countries in dealing with these issues, but the fact is that if people are at large then it is much more difficult in a significant proportion of cases to be able to identify, locate and remove them. It is one of the reasons that we seek to ensure that those people who turn up without lawful authority are detained and are available for processing and removal.The honourable member asked a question about some information that was given in relation to protection visas. It is very important to understand that in section 501 of the Migration Act, which deals with character issues, security is one of those issues which we seek to examine, but there are other issues which we seek to take into account. Those issues can go to such matters as serious crimes such as hijacking or taking hostages, matters of crimes against humanity -  - I am simply making the point that the ASIO function deals specifically with security related issues in the broader provisions of section 501. - The number is 10. Under the section of the Migration Act which applies the provisions of the refugee convention article 1F, people are able to be excluded if they are broadly of character concern. A number of people have been subject to character exclusion. I identified the number as 10. I do not intend to go further. - I will just say this to the Leader of the Opposition: I would not care of it were one, quite frankly. If you have people of substantial character concern that are likely to pose a risk to the Australian community, they should be excluded. The point is that the provisions of the Migration Act and the scrutiny to which people are subjected need to be thorough and efficacious, and that is what this government has been ensuring.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and her commitment to building character in young people. We recently visited Emmaus Primary School and the Flagstone State School where $700,000 of Commonwealth money went into some very important capital works projects. The parents of the 3.27 million children who attend Australian schools are increasingly looking for a number of things for the education of their children which relate to the aspirations that they have for them. They are concerned about who is teaching their children, what they are being taught and whether they can read, write, count and communicate when they leave the school. Whilst parents do not always express it in these terms, they are talking about standards; they are interested not only in uniforms and in discipline in schools but also in the kinds of values that underwrite the framework in which the education is being delivered. This government in particular believes that parents should be able to make choices in terms of the schools to which they will send their children, and in making those choices we are equally determined that schools be encouraged to provide a values based education to Australian children. There are many changes in our society today that we do not always understand nor want. It is important that we recognise that the guiding story for education is about building character in young adults as much as it is about transferring skills, knowledge and information. In fact, Benjamin Franklin said, `Freedom and a free society depend very much on character.'It does not matter how many laws we pass in this parliament. Unless we have individuals who are prepared to abide by those laws, we will not be a civil society. The member for Werriwa recently, in expounding on a political doctrine based on hatred, justified that doctrine in part by the observation that the Australian way apparently is for parents to criticise and get into referees at football games, for example - games in which children are participating. That has never been the Australian way, nor indeed should it be. - This government is making a first instalment. I have put aside $580,000 from my portfolio to specifically conduct some pilot work. The Australian Curriculum Corporation is to do some detailed work about what values are currently taught in both government and non-government Australian schools, how those values were developed and how that compares with the way values are inculcated in education in other countries. In addition I will be inviting, in the first instance, 60 schools to demonstrate to us the kind of values that they teach in their schools, how they developed them, the kinds of relationships that exist between teachers, parents, local communities and indeed the governments that support those schools. We want to see that schools are, for example, teaching children to be trustworthy, to treat people with respect, to be courteous, to be responsible, to be accountable and to do their best. Surely we want children to leave school being fair and reasonable. We want them to be caring, to be good citizens and volunteers and to protect our environment, amongst many other things.As far as this government is concerned, the principal of the Salisbury High School put it very well. In the Adelaide Advertiser recently she said that students at her school are `groomed to become well-adjusted adults, whether or not they are academic achievers' and that the school `surveyed students and parents to establish which values should be upheld by the school's structuring and teaching'. She said:Our aim is to see every student gain employment or higher education but we also want to see students leave with integrity, to be able to hold down a job, to be organised and to have self-esteem.Our ambition for education as a nation should be not only to prepare young people for the future but also, importantly, to give them the skills, the confidence and the character to create the kind of future that they want.</DOC>

 - I will not attempt to try and verify the accuracy of all of the statements that have been recounted by the honourable member for Lalor. I was not at the hearing. I have not seen the evidence. I have had an oral report that the director-general of security advised that there had been no adverse assessments over a specific period of time. I am aware of that. The point I was making was that ASIO has a very specific remit, and that the provisions in relation to 1F of the refugee convention are much wider and the issues in relation to character go to a range of questions that might be beyond the direct issues relating to security that ASIO looks at. That is the only point I was making.I reiterate what I have said: there have been, amongst protection visa applicants, 10 refusals under section 501, under which the provisions of 1F of the refugee convention are applied, and those issues go to a range of matters upon which people are entitled to be excluded under the refugee convention. There are 10 such matters. Some of them are the subject of appeal. They go to very serious issues relating to both the safety and the general security of the Australian community. We have properly and vigorously sought to ensure that people who are likely to receive a positive outcome in relation to a protection visa application are subjected to that scrutiny.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro. I certainly enjoyed a recent visit with him down to Captains Flat, about an hour from here, and I congratulate the Work for the Dole participants who have been doing a great job down there. Since this parliament last met, on 1 July, the mutual obligation that this government has had as a keynote to its policy has been extended. In fact, through 2002-03 there will be an additional 5,500 Work for the Dole places throughout Australia providing opportunities for Australia's unemployed, and growing by an additional 8,500 in the following year. We are also promoting the success of this program by building on the great work opportunities that are provided by not only building better communities but also assisting these people by providing them with up to $800 via a training credit. This is money that they can use to assist in buying accredited training to assist them to get into work.As this House would be aware, I often have come here after trawling through web sites, particularly the Labor Party web site, looking for anything at all that the Labor Party might want to say of a positive nature to do with Work for the Dole or mutual obligation. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that I have finally found some comments on mutual obligation on a labour party web site, so I thought they were worth bringing to the House's attention. This web site says:In welfare, for too long the Left have argued for rights but were rather weak on responsibilities. It is right for them, the unemployed, for the country, for the society, that they should get that chance. But with that comes a responsibility on the individual to take the chance, to make something of their lives and to use their ability and their potential to its full.The same web site goes on to say:Ours has to be an enabling welfare state, one which helps people to help themselves ...This is a Labor Party web site, and I can see surprise in some of those opposite. It continues:The concept of mutual obligation has to go all the way through the system. Government has a responsibility to provide real opportunities for individuals. There is growing public support for a welfare state that gets people into work and that offers people hope in exchange for a commitment to help themselves.I can see a few people opposite with some quizzical looks on their faces, because, unfortunately, it is not the Australian Labor Party's web site - it has nothing. It is, in fact, New Labour's - it is New Labour under a real leader, something that is lacking here. Can I suggest to old Labor, decrepit Labor, failed Labor, that it is time you took up that call from New Labour and Prime Minister Blair and supported what this government and every member on this side of the House acknowledge as being a wonderful program for individuals, the community and the nation - and that, of course, is Work for the Dole and mutual obligation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Can I say that section 300A of the Corporations Act requires details of the nature and amount of each element of the emolument of each director and each of the five named officers of the company receiving the highest emolument. Yesterday, the member for Fraser alleged that this was not being observed and he relied upon a report from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors Inc. Contrary to his assertions in the House yesterday, the finding was that disclosure here was generally quite good. In fact, in relation to the details of the amount, according to this report there was a 91 per cent disclosure. It is certainly a material fact he seemed to leave out.As I said to the House yesterday, the argument is about how one values options. That is what the argument is. You can look around the world and you will not find a standard in relation to valuation. Companies rightly say they have no accounting standard in which to lay down the valuation. This is being coped with in Australia in two ways. - It is entirely relevant and if the Leader of the Opposition would just refrain from his interjections long enough to hear it, he would hear me say that Australian accounting standards have the force of law unless their standard is disallowed by either house of the parliament.In relation to the valuation point which will lay down the disclosure standard on valuation, the AASB released on 31 May 2002 its director, executive and related party disclosures. Once that is made final, unless disallowed by either house of the parliament, that will be the valuation standard which applies in relation to section 300A. In addition to that, because there is no standard in the United States or anywhere else, the International Accounting Standards Board is currently working on its own valuation. The AASB has indicated it will be adopting that as soon as it is made and it is expected to be made in October 2002. - Let me take you through it again. Australian accounting standards have the force of law unless disallowed by either house of parliament. There is no accounting standard for the purposes of section 300A in relation to valuation until such time as the Australian Accounting Standards Board issues the final standard. It released a draft standard on 31 May 2002. When that becomes final, it has the force of law for the purposes of section 300A.In addition, the International Accounting Standards Board, which is making a valuation disclosure standard for all of the countries around the world, will issue its own draft in October 2002. Once that is made final, it will be adopted by the AASB and, unless disallowed by either house of the parliament, will apply for the purposes of section 300A, therefore giving the valuation point.We welcome the interest of the Labor Party in this issue, which sort of popped up last week. The member for Fraser took it very hard last week that we were going out to western Queensland. Consequently, he crept up to Laurie Oakes to give Laurie Oakes his big secret research so that Laurie could publish it on the Wednesday and try and derail the trip. Laurie duly had his secret research, but it failed to derail the trip.Then I was driving down the road from Longreach to Roma and I heard the member for Fraser, who had crept up to the Press Gallery, say that we were out of touch out there in Longreach. We were out of touch. We were not in touch with the people of Australia. He broadcast from the Parliament House Canberra studio! He creeps up to that gallery, he creeps here, he creeps there, he creeps everywhere. If you see a dark shadow in Parliament House he may be just creeping out of it. - It is rather spooky. He is creeping everywhere. He may creep through the gallery, but he cannot creep his way through the Corporations Law. He had a bad week and he is wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am certainly aware of the concerns the Queensland sugar industry, and the sugar industry in the honourable member's own electorate, is facing with the economic difficulties at present. The low world price is certainly having a major impact on the viability of the industry and farmers are concerned about their potential to have a viable industry in the future. The federal government is currently considering arrangements to respond to the concerns of the sugar industry. We are also in discussions with the Queensland government on those issues.It is true that the Queensland government has provided very little support for the sugar industry over recent years. Two years ago, when the industry was in trouble, the Queensland government provided a total $60,000 in loans to the industry, whereas this government provided support which in the end was valued at over $60 million in real assistance. That financial support helped farmers to get through a particularly difficult time. We were disappointed that the Queensland government did little at that stage to provide any kind of support to help the industry.However, on this occasion the Queensland government are being a little more constructive. Our discussions with them to date have demonstrated that they have a willingness to participate in reform in the industry and to achieve an outcome that will assure the prosperity of the industry. Those negotiations are continuing. They will undoubtedly, as the Prime Minister suggested yesterday, involve significant reform of the industry, and that is the responsibility of the Queensland government. We indicated when commissioning the Hildebrand report that the single desk for export sales was not on the table. In our negotiations we are dealing with a range of other regulatory issues that are of importance in order to ensure that the industry is able to achieve its potential and that there is a capacity for the flexibility and the versatility that will be necessary to build a new industry.At this stage we are in the processes of developing a response. I hope that very soon there can be an agreement between the governments which will provide meaningful support to growers in Queensland. We will need assistance from the New South Wales and Western Australian governments to ensure that the New South Wales and Western Australian industries are able to participate in a revitalised Australian sugar industry in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. It gives me an opportunity to reiterate the government's family tax benefit program. I will state again that this is all about giving extra payments to Australian families. Two million Australian families received at least $2 billion extra through the family tax benefit and, of course, that gave assistance to the children of those families.We did make some modifications. For the first time, those parents - particularly if they overestimated their income and, therefore, were entitled to more family tax benefit - could receive that at the end of the year when a reconciliation was done. That was called a top-up payment. Certainly, in the first financial year when the new taxation system came into place, I have been informed that up to about 400,000 families received that. The question the honourable member asks is, `Why isn't that period perhaps longer, compared to other social security legislation or law?' I might add that the arrangements that we have in place for family tax benefit, particularly the top up, which allows 12 months, allow significantly longer than just about any other form of social security payment. - Perhaps the member for Lilley might learn something about this, because the legislation that was put through on this over two years ago was supported by this parliament and, indeed, a lot of this notification is in the Tax Pack. But I want to reiterate again that there is a 12-month period for that top up and that is very generous compared to other forms of social security payments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. In the week that the World Summit on Sustainable Development is commencing in Johannesburg - and the Australian delegation is being led very ably by the Minister for the Environment - it is important to record that Australia has much to be proud of in relation to the support of sustainable development. For example, since the coalition came to power in 1996, we have made available over $3 billion in funding for national resource management and for restoration of our environment. We have introduced Australia's first-ever oceans policy, which will balance conservation and development, put fisheries on a sustainable basis and help restore our coastal habitats. Globally, we have energetically pursued sustainable management of international oceans -  from protecting whales to seeking a tight management regime for southern bluefin tuna and other species. We have finalised regional forest agreements, covering some of our most important forests and laying out the ground rules for protection as well as development. We have provided over $1 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Australian industry, with Australia's emissions being significantly cut over and above the business-as-usual levels. We have introduced significantly tighter fuel and vehicle emissions standards to protect our urban environment. At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, Australia will be announcing at least 12 partnerships with governments, business and non-government organisations to promote a better global environment.These are some of the practical measures that this government has taken in the 6½ years it has been in power to advance the cause of sustainable development. It is a record of which this government is proud, it is a record that has made an effective contribution and it is a record of which Dr Kemp and others will speak very proudly when they make their contributions to the meeting in Johannesburg.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question, because it does raise a very important issue, I believe, for this parliament and indeed for this country, and that is the importance of the early years - from zero to five - when it comes to a child's welfare. To answer some of the specific questions -  - He says it is his policy. So you are agreeing with me - that is very good to hear. - Certainly this coalition government is absolutely committed to improving the health, wellbeing and welfare of all Australian families, and indeed all children. The member for Lilley asked a number of specific questions, and before I answer them I would like to just state that, at the moment, there is more Commonwealth funding going towards families that there has ever been in Australia's history. - That funding, I might just reiterate, is over $11.4 billion in family tax benefit, $1.4 billion in child-care benefit, just under $6 billion in parenting payment and an enormous amount is going out on maternity allowance and immunisation.  - Yes, we do have a package called the Stronger Families and Stronger Communities package, which was put in place a number of years ago, where we had $240 million worth. We still have $144 million which we will be spending in a whole range of areas. One of the key areas that money is going towards is a longitudinal study over the next nine years, which will cost about $20 million. There were some reductions made across the whole board - not in those particular programs - as a way of ensuring that we balanced this budget. You opposed some important measures in the Senate in the area of PBS and in the area of the disability support pension.But the key point - and I am very glad the member for Lilley has raised this - is that I do believe it is absolutely essential that we in this country kick off a proper discussion and debate on the importance of the early years. This is not about cutting welfare payments; there is no such suggestion. What it is about is ensuring that as a nation we give more emphasis to enhancing the skills of parents, particularly young parents, when they bring a child into the world. - It is interesting that we get this interjection. I notice that the member for Gellibrand is listening, and I think she has played a critical role in going around and talking to many of the people that I have also spoken to about building an early childhood development agenda. Why shouldn't we? Because we know - whether it is at the emotional, educational or behavioural level - it is those early years that are absolutely crucial in making sure that a child has a full and healthy life. The issues that we need to confront today are that we still have over one in 10 children who are considered to be obese, one in five who are overweight, an alarming increase in the number of children with diabetes, an alarming increase in the seeds that are being sown when it comes to heart disease - particularly for children with diabetes - and of course the issue of mental health. It is extremely important that we have an open and fair debate on the importance of the early years through early intervention and prevention, and I am happy to do that. I will continue to advocate this course, just as the government will.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I recognise his keen interest in the steel industry and exports from his electorate of Flinders. Last Friday there was more good news for the steel industry and for the 26,000 Australians who are employed in Australia's steel industry. Last week it was announced that OneSteel's galvanised cold-form steel angles and flats had received an exclusion from the tariffs under the US safeguard action. That means that Australia's requests have now reached a success rate of eight out of the nine exclusions we have sought for products. That is a significant outcome from where we were in March this year, when the US administration announced its intention to impose tariffs on imported steel under a section 201 safeguard action. Since that day, we have not stopped fighting on behalf of the 26,000 workers in the steel industry, and we have been significantly successful. The first thing we did was to pull together all the stakeholders in the steel industry in Australia - which included the manufacturers, the exporters, the unions, governments - and have a steel summit. You will recall, Mr Speaker, the one that the member for Rankin and the dearly departed member for Cunningham tried to criticise with so many behind him. The former member for Cunningham was a good bloke. He very actively pursued the interests of his constituents in the Australian steel industry in a very constructive way. We established a monitoring task force that has been monitoring what has been happening in terms of imported product coming into Australia, with the possibility of displaced product in the international marketplace. That work has been ongoing in conjunction with all the stakeholders in the industry, the union movement and the state governments.The important point to make is that by April of this year we had secured exclusion of BHP's hot-rolled steel product, which was quite significant. Since then we have been successful in achieving a succession of exclusions for a small range of items that we export to the United States. These exclusions are for the duration of the three-year safeguard action - not just for 12 months. As I said, we have now achieved exclusion for eight out of the nine exclusion requests, with the latest one being last week.  - It is an excellent outcome. The companies involved include Ryco Hydraulics, and all of their requests for product exclusion have been granted. All of OneSteel's requests for product exclusion have been granted. All of BHP's slab and hot-rolled steel products have been excluded. We are still arguing the case on the ninth of our applications, and that is the cold-rolled products, which we are still pursuing with the United States in a diplomatic way. With that result, obviously Australia's steel industry has been very appreciative of our having secured its future and the future of its 26,000 workers, and our exporters have been quick to acknowledge the government's positive role in obtaining these exclusions from the tariffs. We have received a letter from the Managing Director of Ryco, which says:We really appreciate the work that has gone into making this possible. This means extra employment here in Australia to benefit all.We have a letter from Mark Gell, the General Manager of External Affairs with OneSteel. It says:The recent exemptions by the US government will allow OneSteel to further develop the US market as a potential export destination for its high value-added products. We believe these exemptions would not have been possible without the government's persistence and efforts.  We have a letter from David Goodwin from BHP, which says:The government's support has been vital to the very good outcome which has been achieved in extremely difficult circumstances. From the outset, we took a path of lobbying the American administration following this decision and arguing the very sound case on behalf of Australia's steel industry. We engaged constructively with the stakeholders in this industry, and we have achieved an outcome that has seen eight out of our nine requests receive exemption or exclusion from tariffs. On anybody's measure, that is a very good outcome for the 26,000 workers in the Australian steel industry.</DOC>

 - I refute completely the suggestion that people have been denied benefits to which they are entitled. This is a very simple issue: if somebody is paid more than they are entitled to under the law, it is not unreasonable on a proper basis for that money to be repaid. - This is a bit like the Labor Party's policy on border protection. They say they are in favour of it but then they run around implying that they would change it. The reality is that the system we have introduced provides for certain benefits. If people's income changes and there is money that they have been overpaid, they are expected to pay it back. There is nothing wrong with that, and that is the basis on which it operates. As for the reference the Leader of the Opposition made to people's entitlements being stripped, it has long been a principle that, if a debt is owed to the Commonwealth, it is set off against a taxation refund entitlement. That has been used for a long time. The former government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, as I understand it, would regularly have recovered overpayments of family allowance and the like through the taxation system. There is nothing new about it. If you were to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's question and did not understand precisely what the situation was, you would imagine that we were taking back money that people were entitled to. We are not. I operate on the basis that, if you are entitled to more at the end of the year, you should be paid it and, if you have been paid more than you are entitled to, it is not unreasonable for the rest of the taxpaying community to expect that money to be returned. I think most Australians agree with that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I can report to her that most international forecasts are still forecasting strong growth in Australia in 2002 and in 2003. Of the 15 countries covered by the Economist survey, Australia is expected to lead the field with the strongest growth in 2002 and in 2003. Consensus Economics also expects Australia to have the fastest growth of the industrialised world in 2002 and the second fastest in 2003. The threats that we see to the Australian economy to some degree in the rural sector, with bad seasonal conditions, particularly in New South Wales, will have an effect on production and, of course, the international situation remains weak. But Australia is in a strong economic position today because of the economic reforms which have been put in place by this government - economic reforms like repaying $62 billion of Labor Party debt, which strengthened our economy, and locking in low inflation outcomes by reforming Australia's taxation system, which gave our exporters a go on world markets. Few people could forget that the Labor Party opposed taxation reform every step of the way in the last parliament. Nobody would be a greater political opportunist than the Leader of the Opposition, who opposed tax reform all the way and, after losing the last election, suddenly lost all his interest in roll-back. There is a phrase we have not heard in this parliament for a while: `the Labor Party policy on roll-back'. The Leader of the Opposition said that Australia would have its economy king hit by the GST. He said, 18 months ago:I believe we're in the midst of a very serious downturn. I believe the single most contributing factor to that downturn has been the GST ...That was said 18 months ago. Notwithstanding that -  - That was true, was it?  - Mr Speaker, he just intervened to say that that was true. Notwithstanding the fact, `We're in the midst of a very serious downturn' is what he said and he now claims that it was true. Here is an economy which shrugged off a recession in the US in 2001, which grows faster in 2002 than other developed countries and which is forecast to grow faster in 2003 and the Leader of the Opposition, for political opportunistic reasons, was forecasting a severe downturn.  - The member for Werriwa interjects. We congratulate him on his new appointment as the shadow minister for community safety. What a sense of fun the Leader of the Opposition has! We begin by putting up a plan for community safety for the taxidrivers of Western Sydney. We do congratulate that sense of naughtiness that the Leader of the Opposition had in his new appointments.What put the Australian economy in the strong position it is in today is the reforms of this government. Those reforms were fought every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party. They are still fighting against our budget reforms in the Australian Senate and we say: if Australia wants better economic prospects, withdraw the opportunistic opposition in the Australian Senate, do the right thing by Australia and strengthen this economy.</DOC>

 - There are couple of interesting things about that question. The first interesting thing about the question is that I do not remember, last year, when many who now sit behind the Leader of the Opposition were calling for special action in relation to mass marketed tax schemes, the Labor Party at that particular time calling those people tax minimisers.  - My understanding is that the former Assistant Treasurer in the Keating government, George Gear, was in fact a person who ran around this building and, far from describing the people you are now talking about as tax minimisers, represented them as innocent victims of the claimed perfidy of the Australian Taxation Office. - So don't you interject `double standards' at me. It is the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion who is guilty of double standards.The simple reality in relation to the family tax benefit is twofold. The first is, as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has pointed out on many occasions, the size of the benefits now offered by this government on behalf of the rest of the Australian community dwarfs by comparison anything offered by the former government. I might remind the House that none of these benefits would have been possible if the policy of the Labor Party on tax reform had been followed. The Labor Party every stage of the way opposed taxation reform. It likes the political spin-off; the assumed political advantage. The member for Brand will remember his immortal phrase - it will certainly live long in my memory - when he said to his caucus, `We're going to surf into victory on the back of unpopularity of the GST.' In other words, you ran the most opportunistic campaign. None of these benefits would have been the least bit possible if it had not been for the introduction of tax reform. Now you parade yourselves as the great defenders of the Australian family. This government has done more in the area of family benefits than any other government since World War II, and I am immensely proud of what we have been able to do. What we have done in recent years would not have been possible without taxation reform. We had the courage to introduce tax reform. You opportunistically opposed it. The Australian public can see through your completely transparent position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in regional aviation, representing an electorate the size of many European countries put together. I am pleased to be able to report that the Australian aviation industry, underpinned by sound government policy, is making a very strong recovery from the traumas of the last 12 months. Early last week in this House I touched on the creation of a new airline, Regional Express - Rex - which will continue to serve all routes previously serviced by Kendell and Hazelton, which were Ansett subsidiaries. The launch of Rex follows the successful sale of Flightwest, Skywest and Aeropelican. All of them are now providing regular passenger transport services to regional Australia under new ownership. We supported that process with some $18 million under the Rapid Route Recovery Scheme provided to some 18 operators across the nation, which enabled the provision of essential air services after the collapse of Ansett.In recent days we have seen further evidence that Australian aviation is in sound and improving shape. Last week we saw Qantas record a net profit of $428 million, while Sydney airport also recorded a very strong improvement in its after-tax profit from around $23 million to $87 million - all at a time when, importantly, it ought to be noted, airlines and airports around the world are doing it very tough. During that time Qantas, in particular, reported that its staff numbers grew by about 1½ thousand. I think all of us would welcome profitable airlines. That offers us better and stronger services into the future. We also want profitable airports. These figures indicate that we are well on the way to achieving both. Qantas has also announced that it plans to take delivery of no fewer than 35 brand new aircraft in the short to medium term. Importantly, the release of these figures coincides with the government's decision that Qantas will remain truly Australian. Our aviation policies have also allowed Virgin to enter the market. They are continuing to grow strongly and indeed are looking to expand their fleet to a total of 50 aircraft within the next five years. Virgin have managed so far to secure access to several of the former Ansett terminals - Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra come to mind. That will further enhance their capacity to grow and compete. Regrettably, they have not yet come to an agreement with Sydney airport over the use of its former Ansett terminal. I do note that these are ultimately matters for the parties to negotiate commercially, but I urge them to resume good faith negotiations with a view to coming to satisfactory outcomes for the benefit of the travelling public.I was asked about alternative policies. We have not seen much at all in the way of alternative policies on aviation since the opportunistic but very shallowly based arguments during the last campaign about the future of Ansett. But it is never too late to turn over a new leaf. There is something constructive the opposition could do in the interests of safeguarding the future of our aviation industry, and that is to call on their union mates not to engage in the sort of irresponsible action that we saw last week when the Australian Services Union disrupted hundreds of Qantas flights nationally. That sort of action threatens the very recovery we are all looking for in aviation and in the related downstream industries - most of all tourism.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Gellibrand for her question, her range of questions or her statement - I was not quite sure. Nevertheless, I think she does raise a number of important issues when it comes to child care. I will reiterate that it is this government, it is the Liberal-National Party government, that is spending more money in child care than there has ever been spent in Australia's history - $8 billion over the next four years. - To reiterate, we are spending $8 billion over the next four years. We spent $7 billion in the last six years, which was, of course, significantly more - 70 per cent more - than Labor spent in its last six years of government. No matter where the figures are coming from, for the member for Gellibrand's benefit, the facts are that there are more children today - 720,000 children - using Commonwealth funded child care. Indeed, we have seen a rapid increase; over 192,000 more kids in Commonwealth funded child care, predominantly since the introduction of the child-care benefit. And what a great thing that has been for parents. Why? Because the costs have gone down - by about nine per cent since July 2000 -  - there has been a significant increase in funding, and if you ask the child-care sector -  - they will say that funding towards the child-care sector has never been as great. And we will continue to fund it. Yes, there are some hotspots, because we are finding now that a lot more demand is being created. That is why there are 2,000 more centres today than there were when the Labor Party was last in government in 1996. So these are the facts: there are 2,000 more centres, costs have gone down and there are more children in Commonwealth funded child care than there have ever been before. The member for Gellibrand does ask about child-care workers, and I think this is a serious point: yes, I think that society as a whole perhaps has to value more the work that a lot of those people do in child-care centres. It is not a de facto babysitting service, though some people may think that; they do a fantastic job. Perhaps, as this argument and as this debate expands, parents will have to value more the role that those early childhood professionals play. But I think the type of claim that is in place now for an increase of over 100 per cent is very unwise.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question, and I recognise the interest he shows in this issue and the support he has provided to the government in its strong stand on people-smuggling issues. I think all members of the House know that the government regards people-smuggling as a serious crime that exploits people. Interestingly, people-smuggling is said to be - according to the latest figures provided to me - worth something like $20 billion a year to criminal networks, which is an extraordinary figure.Interestingly, it also continues to be a concern for other countries in our region. I note that the Pacific Islands Forum communique for the first time included a strong statement by leaders urging greater international cooperation and encouraging members to develop national strategies to combat people-smuggling. Australia has played a leading role in forging regional cooperation in the fight against people-smuggling. I do not need to remind the House of the significance of the Bali Regional Ministerial Conference, which was cohosted by my Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, and me. This conference was, without any doubt, a watershed event for the region. It brought together 38 ministerial level representatives from 36 countries and it provided a program of practical cooperation. I note, for example, that Thailand and New Zealand, who are the chairs of the working group set up by the Bali process, met with Australia and Indonesia in Wellington only last week in order to report on progress and take the cooperation still further steps forward.It is also worth noting that, at the ASEAN post ministerial conference meeting last month, I was invited to be the lead speaker on transnational issues, including people-smuggling. What was significant was the strong degree of support for the strong stand that Australia is taking on this issue and the expressions of concern about people-smuggling. In the last few weeks there has been a very interesting and important example of regional cooperation on people-smuggling when a boatload of 56 Sri Lankans arrived in the East Timorese capital Dili claiming that they were en route to New Zealand. The Australian government, particularly through our embassy in Dili, worked closely with the East Timorese government, the IOM and the UNHCR to stop the risky travel by these people in this very small boat. The suggestion that they would get all the way from there to New Zealand in a very small boat simply demonstrates the dimensions of the risk involved to them. What is interesting is that, as a result of this cooperation, all 56 of those Sri Lankans have now decided not to pursue any asylum claims and have agreed to voluntarily return to Sri Lanka, and the International Organisation for Migration, the IOM, is organising their repatriation. Interestingly, the East Timorese police have since deported the two Sri Lankan nationals who facilitated this people-smuggling operation. It is clear that the regional approach to people-smuggling is working; it is having a very real effect throughout the region. I was asked yesterday on a television program about this issue of people-smuggling and I think I may have said that the last boat to arrive on the mainland of Australia was in November of last year. I have been reminded this morning that it was not in November; it was in August of last year, and I note that the Jakarta head of the International Organisation for Migration was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday as saying:Clearly the message has gotten across - the door to Australia is closed.That is one of the many articulations of the success of the Australian policy.</DOC>

 - I am really delighted that the Labor Party is showing such interest in the policies around child care. The honourable member asks a number of serious questions, which I am very happy to answer. The first is the issue of outside school hours care. Since the Liberal-National Party have come into government, there has been a 221 per cent increase in the number of children using outside school hours care. There has been a huge increase happening under the policies of this government. As it stands now in outside school hours care - as is the case in family day care for this year - places are going to be reallocated amongst those services that may not have been using them, and we are doing that. When it comes to outside school hours care, part of the issue is funding but the other part is ensuring that there are adequate regulations and licensing at state and territory level. The responsibility, particularly for regulation, does rest with the states. I believe that this is a real issue because of the quality standard. They recognise that - that is why we have deferred the accreditation process for outside school hours care until next year. - I hear the interjection from the member for Gellibrand, and even she acknowledges that it is important that we ensure that the standards are at the highest level, particularly with incoming accreditation. When it comes to the special needs scheme -  -  - If you want to listen, another interesting fact is that it has increased substantially: $10 million in 1997 to over $22 million in the past financial year. There has been a cap placed on that, as we look at that particular system to see how we can best assist those 4,400 children currently funded who have disabilities. I will be looking at a whole range of issues within child care to best try and respond to the changing demands that we have in assisting families meet work and family responsibilities, particularly with the issue of outside school hours care.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. There has been a focus of some attention on these matters over this last weekend. It is appropriate to remind ourselves about the nature of the decisions that we had to take and the impact of those decisions. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned a moment ago, there have been no boat arrivals on the Australian mainland since August last year. There were attempts to reach Australia. There were also some people who came to territories somewhat later than that and they were sent to be processed offshore. But the fact is that there has been a very substantial change in the situation that we saw up until then.Some people have asked me whether there has been a lack of proportionality in relation to these matters. The fact is that, while there were some 200 or more vessels that arrived in Australian waters over a four-year or so period, the numbers of people who were travelling went up very rapidly - from 147 some four years ago to 970 three years ago to over 4,000 two years ago. In that period up until August, some 3,500 people were seeking to access Australia. With the very large number of people that we believe were in Indonesia at that time and further along the pipeline, intent on travelling to Australia, it would not be unreasonable to assume that, if we had not acted, we were looking at potentially 12,000 people. The steps that we took, which included returns, the Pacific solution, the matters mentioned by the foreign minister, the Bali conference and the assistance that we have received from countries in this region, have turned that situation around. What are the implications of that? If we were really dealing always, and in every case, with refugees who had an urgent need for a resettlement outcome, one perhaps would not worry. But when you have people smugglers choosing for you, some people who will be refugees, some people who may not, all you have is a group of people, even if they obtain refugee status in Australia, who are in exactly the same circumstances as 14 million other people who have been assessed and found to be refugees elsewhere in the world. The question you always have to ask yourself is: what would you be doing if you really wanted to help the most vulnerable refugees - those in situations where they cannot return home, those in situations where they are faced with an immediate danger? It may well be people who are in mixed relationships or people who have a very high profile. The reality is that what we have been able to do now, as Australians, is to increase substantially our effort to assist with the resettlement of refugees who are in those situations, as well as those who come under the special humanitarian program. Let me make it very clear what that means. What it has meant for this year is that the offshore refugee and humanitarian programs have been able to accommodate for the year 2001-02, the financial year just finished, 8,416 people. Prior to that we were looking at it being 6,500. There has been a substantial increase in the number of people we are able to accommodate.If the situation that we have seen since then continues, I cannot assert positively that there will not be further boat arrivals. We know that people are intent on trying to reopen smuggling operations if they can. We know that that is happening. But if we are able to hold the line on these matters, hopefully with the support of the parliament and the opposition we have the prospect of being able to settle over 10,000 people during the current program year. For those people who have special needs, nobody should complain that we are making sure that Australia is able to determine who ought to be able to help them, and it is not being determined for us by people smugglers.  </DOC>

 - I am flattered that the member for New England should have such confidence in my understanding of constitutional law as to invite me to give a legal opinion, but I will pass up that opportunity. There is a rough prospect that the member for New England may have been thinking of legislation, for example, to impose a community service obligation on a telecommunications carrier. When I went to the Sydney University Law School, I read of a fellow called Dyson and it put me in mind of some opposition policies, of course. He said that there was a doctrine that said one parliament could not bind another - and that is right. - We should always operate under the assumption that a law passed by one parliament can always be repealed by another parliament, and I would not try and pretend otherwise. That, of course, is a very good reason for not changing the present government. I can think of a plethora of laws from those who sit opposite. Just imagine how the Labor Party would apply that doctrine to border protection legislation. Just think how they would apply that doctrine to laws relating to family benefits. I thank the member for New England for asking me this question. It gives me a whole new stream of consciousness about the dangers of electing a Labor government.Let me assure the member for New England that in relation to Telstra, which I am sure is in the honourable member's mind, our policy is that we are not going to sell any further shares in Telstra unless we are satisfied that services in the bush are up to scratch. We have appointed an inquiry. Three very reputable Australians are going to have a look at that. When they give us that report, we will then know whether those services are up to scratch. We remain committed to legislative community service obligations. It is true that if this government were defeated at the next election it would be open to a future government to change and take away the community service obligation. So I think what the member for New England has done is to remind the parliament that, when it comes to guaranteeing telecommunication services in the bush, it is always dangerous to elect a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I know how important the motor industry is to him and how it is always on his mind. That is understandable, because the motor industry is the heart of the Australian manufacturing sector and it directly employs some 55,000 people. Unfortunately, three times over the past year the industry has been brought to the brink of a standstill because of strikes orchestrated by the AMWU, a union that has donated some $3 million to the Labor Party over the last few years and which controls the largest block vote in the Victorian ALP conference. As if he has not already done enough damage, Dougie Cameron, the AMWU boss, is threatening further disruption if the Productivity Commission report is not to his liking.The most recent development is a call by the ACTU for the creation of an industry council comprising chief executives and union officials in this industry. If this council leads to a greater focus on workplace bargaining, if this council means less industrial disruption and no illegal strikes, then it may be a positive thing. But if this provides just another platform for the AMWU, if it provides yet another forum to promote pattern bargaining, if it turns out to be a reward for industrial disruption, then it is the last thing that this industry needs. As far as the ACTU is concerned, it seems to want the re-creation of the accord in one industry as a dry run for the Accord Mark IX that it has been promised by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition runs around saying that he wants to reduce union power, but the Sydney Morning Herald says:A secret deal Simon Crean has made -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Sydney Morning Herald says:A secret deal Simon Crean has made guaranteeing a big upgrade in union influence is poised to elevate the ACTU secretary - who is promoting this council -  - That is very true, Mr Speaker. Under this secret deal by the Leader of the Opposition, the person who is promoting this council, Greg Combet, is being promoted `to the position of top powerbroker in the Labor Party' - that was the authoritative statement by that great paper of record, the Sydney Morning Herald. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean on the secret deal that he is foisting on the Australian people, lest the Australian people conclude that he is nothing but a failed union leader who is way out of his depth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question - someone who has real experience in small business, unlike every Labor senator and quite a swag of Labor members of this place. Many people in this House will remember these words:... in relation to the business numbers -  - These words came from the member for Brand:..in relation to the business numbers ...the GST - ... is a disaster on 1 July. Let's not put too fine a point on all of this.The member for Hotham said:There is going to be confusion for mums trying to prepare the kids lunches and there is going to be massive confusion amongst the shopkeepers. - There is this little classic from the member for Hunter, who was the shadow minister for small business. He said: `This actual experience is that up to 20 per cent of small firms will exit post-July 1' - after the introduction of the GST. `We say exit' - the royal `we' - `because they won't necessarily go broke but surely many of them will just simply decide that it is all too hard and not worth it.'Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics have released some new detailed figures in relation to business creation for the 12 months after the introduction of the goods and services tax. I am pleased to inform the House that in the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system Australians created 47,000 new small businesses -  - which is the fastest growth in small business since 1996. In relation to retail accommodation and cafes and restaurants -  - I know the member for Hotham was particularly concerned about retail and restaurants and cafes. The number for retail accommodation, cafes and restaurants was increased by 1,200 new small businesses in the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system.Members will remember that question time after question time the Labor Party would stand up in this place and say, `The new tax system is going to be a disaster for Australia's small businesses' - we remember it on this side of the House. In fact, 1.2 million small businesses remember the fear campaign run by the Labor Party. Yet for the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system, after we reduced company tax to 30 per cent, after we abolished financial institutions duty, after we reduced excise taxes, after we reduced personal income tax so that 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30c in the dollar, after we abolished provisional tax, after we halved capital gains tax - every one of which the Labor Party opposed as part of the new tax system which they opposed lock, stock and barrel - the shameful act was the part taken by the member for Hotham when he said that Australia's small businesses would burn on the new tax system. In fact, the opposite is the truth. It would come as no surprise to the member for Canning that when we keep putting up legislation in this place that we believe is going to help small businesses - such as the removal of the unfair dismissal laws, such as small business protection through the Trade Practices Act reform - the Labor Party not only opposes our proposed changes to help small business but in fact in the Senate last week wanted to extend the unfair dismissal laws to cover all casual workers. That one stroke, if it had become law, would have wiped out half the hospitality industry in Australia.It is no surprise that the Labor Party takes this sort of view. As we heard the other day, the newest Labor senator stood up in the Senate and talked about how the unions were the moral bedrock of Australian society. I have been looking at some of the words of the colleagues of Senator `moral bedrock'. Senator Buckland, a Labor senator from South Australia, said last Thursday:I have never known a fair dismissal.Never is a pretty big call. He said:I have never known a fair dismissal.That might have something to do with the fact that Senator Buckland, before he came into this place, worked for 15 years as an official of the Federated Ironworkers Association and the Federation of Australian Manufacturing Employees. Of the 28 Labor senators, all 28 have never worked in a small business. So there is now a 100 per cent rule: that is 100 per cent for the unions, zero for small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Norwegian ambassador came to see me at one stage. My recollection is that it may have been in February - I am not entirely sure of that; I would have to check - and he raised, I think on the basis of newspaper reports that had appeared in the News Ltd press, the issue of allegations of Australian intelligence interceptions of the Tampa in the context of the Tampa's communications with Norway. I do not recall the exact details of his questions but they were along those sorts of lines - do not hold me to the detail.The point is that we follow the policy in this government that the Hawke and Keating governments followed - and the Fraser government and the Whitlam government and all the governments before them - and that is: we do not discuss intelligence matters with foreign governments and we do not discuss intelligence matters publicly, for very good reasons. All Australian governments have taken that view for the best of reasons. I am glad Australian governments have done that because, if we were to pursue a different kind of policy, it would destroy the efficacy of our intelligence services.</DOC>

 - As honourable members may know, this is Hearing Awareness Week. I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and note his longstanding personal and professional interest in improving the hearing health of all Australians. Indeed, last Friday in Bendigo the honourable member launched a publication entitled Choices, which is a publication produced by Australian Hearing Services for parents of children newly diagnosed with hearing loss. It includes information about specialist services from all the various educational and support organisations as well as from parents and audiologists.Hearing loss is the second most prevalent of health conditions in Australia. The sad fact is that almost one in five Australians are estimated to have hearing loss, and it is estimated that 30 per cent of females and 40 per cent of males over the age of 60 have some degree of significant hearing loss. It has further been projected that that incidence of hearing loss in Australia will grow into the future, estimates indicating a minimum increase of 20 per cent by 2020.The honourable member asked about the services which this government provides for those with hearing loss. In fact, currently there are over 330,000 eligible clients receiving hearing services throughout this program. The very successful voucher scheme run by the Australian government, which was first brought in by the Howard government, provides substantial improvement in terms of hearing, particularly for those who are concessional card holders, for pensioners and veterans and for all children and young people under the age of 21. Indeed, the Commonwealth government's annual expenditure on hearing is some $160 million. In addition to that, some of the best research relating to hearing is undertaken in Australia, particularly through the Australian National Acoustics Laboratory, headed up by Harvey Dillon, whose work in this area is of world renown.As the honourable member indicated, this is Hearing Awareness Week. I take this opportunity of encouraging all Australians to take the opportunity to have a free hearing test. No matter what people's age or circumstances, there is an opportunity this week to have a free hearing test in centres right around Australia. All people need to do to avail themselves of this opportunity is to telephone 131797. I encourage all the occupants of this House - the members and senators and other occupants of Parliament House - to also take a free hearing test. There will be a booth established near Aussies; so if you are going down for a cappuccino or a latte, drop in and have a hearing test. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lalor for her question. Let me just say that back in 1988, when I voted on that issue, I voted on the substantial resolution, which made it clear that there should be proper criteria for selection of people. Nothing that we sought to affirm in maintaining nondiscriminatory principles was to derogate at all from the proper application of criteria for determining who should or should not be able to enter Australia. I make that point very clearly to begin with.The second point is that the fact that it was a ploy - and I knew it was one at the time - did not in any way deviate me from asserting positively my commitment to nondiscriminatory principles for migration in relation to race, religion and like factors, which was the reason I voted in the way in which I did. As minister, I have never been asked to compromise myself in relation to those principles, because the Prime Minister affirms them as strongly as I do. Let me deal with the issue about which the honourable member for Lalor has written to me, because members on this side of the House may not be aware of the nature of that correspondence. - I am sure you do, and I do as well, and I intend to reply to your letter. I am intent on putting in place arrangements to ensure that we deal with children in detention, and their families, as humanely as possible. If there are circumstances in which it is in the best interests of particular children that they be held in alternative ways, I will continue to explore the extent to which alternative detention models can be used. In relation to the first part of the proposition the honourable member for Lalor put to me - that all unaccompanied minors should not be held in detention - there are circumstances in which unaccompanied minors may be more appropriately held in detention. Let me say what those are. Firstly, when an unaccompanied minor has been accompanied by other family members -  - They are not accompanied by their immediate family. - Let me just say, the substantial reason I would not be in favour of making amendments to the Migration Act to try to develop detailed criteria of the sort that the honourable member tries to put in place by using general words is that a whole host of situations would arise in which there would be questions of interpretation, and litigation would arise from the very fact that you had put those provisions in the act. That is what it would lead to. When you have had the opposition out there arguing, as they have -  - The opposition are out there arguing that we should streamline the system for dealing with those people who arrive without lawful authority and make asylum claims in Australia. That is what they are arguing - that we should reduce the time people are held in detention. - The opposition leader makes the point that we should reduce the time it takes to process people and, therefore, reduce the time they are ultimately held in detention. - He says, `Well, send them back.' Every time you put in place additional matters which can lead to litigation, you are opening the gateway for the members of my profession to ensure that people remain in detention for longer periods of time, as they test the limits of every possible opportunity to obtain a different outcome - whether in relation to whether they are on a form of bridging visa or to whether they are released into the community or to whether or not their claims are able to be substantiated. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was pressed on a previous occasion in relation to whether or not, in arguing for the release of children, he was arguing for the release of families - that is, those people who seek to be trafficked into Australia and who bring children with them - he said, `No, I wasn't,' as he says again today. Yet the proposition that is being put to me by the opposition is that we should have a mechanism by which children with families should be released - and their families. That is the proposition that I am being asked to agree to.I am, as I have always been, prepared to look reasonably at whether or not there are alternative ways of dealing with people. The reason we have very few unaccompanied minors in detention today is that I took the decision to have them put into the care of foster families, with the cooperation of the government of South Australia. That is a decision I took. There is no need for an amendment to legislation to achieve that outcome, unless all you are trying to do is to make a political point about these matters. Let me make it very clear: the political point that you are making is that the Labor Party is about introducing into legislation new measures which will keep people in detention longer and in Australia longer, enabling the whole system to be exploited in exactly the same way that it has been. If you think I have acted reasonably in relation to these matters, you should be more than happy to leave the legislation as it is. </DOC>

 - I welcome the opportunity to be able to answer a question in the parliament on Indigenous affairs, because we on this side of the parliament do have a very intense and keen interest in advancing the interests of our first peoples. Of course, what we have sought to do is to promote very positively economic advancement for Indigenous Australians. We see that as being for many of them a real and new opportunity for advancement.We have given a commitment to improving economic circumstances of Indigenous Australians by focusing very much upon individuals through encouraging self-reliance and independence. We have encouraged home ownership as a means of promoting economic independence. We have increased opportunities for Indigenous people to generate better economic returns from their land and we are increasing opportunities for economic independence by stimulating business opportunities in which Indigenous people can be involved. A number of agencies that report to me have been involved in that. ATSIC has provided over $550 million for economic development activities in the last financial year, and that has assisted a thousand Indigenous commercial ventures. The TSRA, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, provides almost $3 million for economic development opportunities. I saw one of those recently at Coconut Island, which I visited. They are involved in the development of a tourist enterprise - a very important initiative on their part. The Indigenous Land Corporation is introducing a stronger focus on economic outcomes through its land acquisition strategy.The very important demonstration of our commitment was the establishment last year of a new organisation, Indigenous Business Australia. Their role is to advance the commercial and economic interests of Indigenous people by accumulating and using a capital asset for the benefit of Indigenous people. They have invested directly in a number of businesses. They have a number of joint venture partners, which include Indigenous communities as well as people with expertise. They currently have an asset base of $70 million and are involved in 23 substantial investments. I have seen some of those recently. One is in the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie, I think, at Monkey Mia in Western Australia. The famous dolphin resort there is now part owned by IBA and the local Indigenous community, as a result of a strategic investment that has been placed.They are involved in a number of other major activities, including the Foxleigh coal mine in Queensland's Bowen Basin, which provides jobs for Indigenous people, and the Gagudju crocodile hotel in Kakadu, a 110-room hotel located within the boundaries of the township. Of course, that helps as well to provide extra economic opportunities for Indigenous people in that region.I have been asked to contain my remarks, but I could expand considerably on the range of economic opportunities that we are expanding for Indigenous Australians. It is a good record, and I am glad the parliament has had an opportunity to hear something of it.</DOC>

 - To address the member for Lilley's question: in the last week or so we have very clearly explained the family tax benefit system to the opposition. I would like to reiterate that Centrelink have been running a communication campaign for quite some time, particularly for the Australian public, emphasising to Australian families - bear in mind that they are receiving more payments under this government than they ever did under the ALP government - that a requirement of the family tax benefit system, which is part of the tax act, is that if there is a change in their circumstances they must notify Centrelink of that change. If Australian families overestimate their income at the end of the year, we have given them the opportunity for the first time ever through the reconciliation process to reconcile and receive a top-up payment. We have been quite open and transparent about this.Family tax benefit part A and B, which is obviously paid either to sole parents or to the parent who is not working, is an incentive or a reward for those who choose to stay at home. As far as the family tax benefit operation is concerned, the member for Lilley may not realise that I am not the minister responsible for that area. As to the family tax benefit, the government is determined to see more money going to Australian families at the end of the day.The onus is on Australian families to give accurate estimations of their income. There have been some examples given. The member for Lilley recently trotted out an example of where a family estimated their income at maybe $20,000 in the first four or five months - they made a few variations. If there is an income of $50,000 at the end of 12 months, there is a major change in the amount of money to which they are entitled. I do not think the Australian public would be critical of the fact that it is means tested and that there is a requirement of an accurate estimation, and that was the provision that we put into the act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her very keen interest in the coalition's child-care policies. In particular, it is important to clarify the record. I believe there was some misrepresentation of the facts yesterday by the member for Gellibrand. Perhaps a word of advice: I hope you do not take a leaf or a lily out of the member for Lilley's usage when he quotes these erroneous figures, because I know you are better than that. I think it is important -  - Mr Speaker, I know you are an excellent advocate when it comes to child care. But I certainly think that this is an opportunity, as the member for McPherson said, to outline some of the misrepresentation - maybe unknowingly - that the member for Gellibrand gave to the parliament yesterday.The amount of money going to child care this year, like over the next four years, is at record levels. But we do not treat all child-care places the same, and they are not. Long day care centres operate for about 50 hours per week, with the average fee at around $187. After school care services operate, as you well know, for about 15 hours a week, and the average payment is $45.20. So it is clear nonsense to compare one child-care place with another and to say there has been a reduction in the amount of money going to those families using CCB or child care. Let me explain the arithmetic a little bit more for your benefit. Since 1996, outside school hours care places have increased by over 170,000. They make up 46 per cent of the places today. In 1996, they made up 23 per cent. There is a greater proportion of people using Commonwealth funded child care in the area of outside school hours care, which I am glad you showed some interest in yesterday. It is inevitable, when you look at your graph - which is incorrect - to state that we are spending less money on child care. These are the facts. Here is the actual amount, and this is you down here and we are here. - Mr Speaker, I just could not help myself. It is a very good example of more money going towards child care than ever before. Here is another graph. It the amount of CCB -  -  - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. This is an important point, because this debate is being misconstrued by means of erroneous graphs that were put into the parliament yesterday. I am quite happy to table these for your benefit, and later today we will be having an MPI debate on this. That will be a great opportunity for us to further clarify the wonderful job we are doing in the area of child care. I want to reiterate: we are spending $8 billion in the next four years. How much did you spend in the four years up to 1996? How much was it? It was $3.325 billion. We are spending 70 per cent more than Labor did in their last six years in office. If you do not believe me, ask the ABS. The ABS have stated that, for the first time, child-care costs have gone down by nine per cent. It is cheaper for families today to get some type of funded place through the child-care benefit than it ever has been before, and the rate of increase of fees is half what it was when the ALP were last in government. Child care, without question, has been a signature project for this government. </DOC>

 - I have the chief gobbler next to me! I would like to reiterate -  -  - We're on this side of the chamber, my friend. - I would like to reiterate part of my previous answer. The family tax benefit system, which we introduced, was I note also supported by the member for Lilley when it was introduced over two years ago. Not only was it a system whereby families got paid significantly more money but it also had flexibility built in it, whether they received their family tax benefit on a fortnightly basis, whether they received it at the end through a reconciliation process - and as I mentioned before that is where the top-up payment came from - or whether it was through arrangements that were part of the taxation system. We are aware that as part of the government's communication strategy, which I believe has been quite extensive, that there may still be some families who may not fully understand the system and -  - As I mentioned before, if there are ways within the existing legislation, as I have been advised, that we can help to make it more flexible for Australian families then the government will look at them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and recognise the interest he shows in this important issue. As I said yesterday in answer to another question, the government have worked very hard on developing appropriate regional arrangements to counter people-smuggling and in recent months we have had a good deal of success. Yesterday the Bangkok Criminal Court handed down a very significant judgment against alleged people smuggler Hassan Ayoub. Mr Ayoub has 15 days in which to appeal this judgment, but it is noteworthy that the judgment found that he could be extradited to Australia where he could face 13 charges under the Commonwealth Migration Act and, if convicted, Mr Ayoub could face a very substantial sentence. The government believes that Ayoub is an important figure in organised criminal people-smuggling networks. He is linked to attempts to send almost 400 asylum seekers illegally from Indonesia to Australia between December 2000 and April 2001.This judgment by the Bangkok Criminal Court follows close cooperation between officers at the Australian Embassy in Bangkok, including the ambassador, the Australian Federal Police and their Thai and, importantly, their Cambodian counterparts. This is not just a story of cooperation with Thailand; it is also a story of cooperation with Cambodia. Cambodia played a vital role in this case, having originally arrested Ayoub and imprisoned him on immigration related offences before he was deported from Cambodia through Thailand.This is yet another example of the very close cooperation between the Australian government and, in this instance, Thailand in dealing with people-smuggling. Thailand is the chair of what is called the second ad hoc experts group, which was established at the Bali conference in February this year. It is looking at the specific issue of the criminalisation of people-smuggling, which is an important issue in the region, and as well as law enforcement.Australian authorities have sought the extradition from Thailand of another prominent alleged people smuggler - Al-Jenabi. This case is currently before the courts. Efforts to ensure that people-smuggling does not continue in the region will be further assisted when a number of countries have introduced immigration legislation, including penalties for people-smuggling. Significantly, I note that two countries are drafting such legislation: Indonesia and Pakistan. When the legislation comes into force it will obviously be yet another weapon that can be used against the people smugglers.This important case, the Ayoub case, is a very significant symbol of the strength of regional cooperation which has now developed to address people-smuggling. I think this government can claim a very great degree of credit for the efforts it has made to crack down on that ugly trade.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The system that was introduced when the new taxation was introduced consolidated a number of family payments and family tax benefits into a smaller number. They were consolidated into family tax A, which was a payment on a means tested basis for parents of all children under a certain age. Family tax B was targeted to single-income families and was essentially a combination of the old dependent spouse rebate plus the additional loading that had been introduced as part of our tax policy in the 1996 election campaign. And the child-care benefits were consolidated into the child-care payment.In the course of doing that, the method of calculating was shifted from a fortnightly basis in relation to the family payments to an annual basis according to taxable income. As a consequence of that, it was always understood and it was always the intention that an estimate of income would be given at the beginning - as time went by, if somebody's income went up, that increase should be notified; if their income went down, that change should be notified - and there would be a reconciliation at the end of the year.As I understand it, what is occurring in some cases is that people are notifying a change - an increase in their income - which may trigger a reduction in their entitlement. The entitlement is being adjusted in relation to the remainder of the year, but it is not being retroactively adjusted to capture the overpayment that has occurred during the first half of the year. - No, I am responding very directly to the Leader of the Opposition's question. If that is the basis of the problem - and I have had some discussions with colleagues about this - it may be possible to fix that administratively. If it is not possible to fix it administratively, then I assume we will have the support of the opposition to fix it legislatively. The other thing in the course of examining the system that I think would help it, would improve it, would be to sever the automatic link under the existing legislation between family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B, whereby you have to take either both of them fortnightly or both of them at the end of the year rather than opting for one fortnightly and one at the end of the year. Having looked at it and seen it operating, I think there might be some merit in allowing people who get family tax benefit B as well as family tax benefit A to have the choice of taking the two.All of these things are said against the background of the basis of the system being that, if you get overpaid, you have to pay it back, and if you get underpaid at the end of the year, you should get a top-up payment. We are not in a position - as much as one would like to - to offer any increases in the benefits. I would remind the parliament and I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that what we are talking about here is the way in which an overpayment is repaid. We are not talking about taking money out of people's pockets; we are talking about the way in which an overpayment is repaid. We are not talking about anything else. It has always been understood that, if you are overpaid, it is only reasonable that, on proper terms, you pay it back.  - I think it is proper terms: if you are owed some money by the Commonwealth and you owe the Commonwealth money, it is only reasonable that the two be off set. That is a principle that the Australian Labor Party upheld. The Labor Party upheld it. I did not hear the Labor Party condemning that principle when they were in office. Sure, if there are ways in which the system after two years of operation can be made to work with greater flexibility, I am interested in looking at that - and I assume that we will have the constructive support of the opposition if any legislation is needed. But let me make it clear: we are not in a position to increase the payments; we are not. We would like to, but we are not at present in a budget position to increase the payments. In any event, they are massive increases on what obtained 6½ years ago.The other point I would simply make is that what is involved here is not whether people should have to repay money they have been overpaid but the way in which it should be repaid. That is a simple principle and it does not alter in any way the very effective way in which Australian families have been rewarded by this new system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I know of her genuine interest and concern that issues involving asylum seekers should be resolved quickly and that detention should be for the shortest possible time. It is an ideal opportunity, I think, to explain some of the complexities associated with this issue and to get a sense of proportion and perspective about it.On 21 August there were only four unauthorised boat arrivals awaiting a primary decision on a protection claim, and all those were awaiting a decision because there were character issues that needed to be determined. So, when we are talking about processing, it is important to understand what it is we are talking about. If we are talking about processing by the immigration department, the processing has been undertaken. If people still remain in detention, it is because there are some other forms of processing that need to be undertaken; that is, processing by a review tribunal, processing of appeals by courts and arrangements to remove people who may have no entitlement to be here - who are not refugees. We have been endeavouring to address all of those areas, and primary decision-making has been expedited very considerably. So, if people arrive in Australia with a genuine intention of pursuing asylum claims with their documents of identity which can give you a clear picture of who they are and where they are from, processing is undertaken in four to six weeks. When you have no documents it can take longer, because there are issues of identity to be dealt with, issues of credibility and the like.On the review side, what have we been doing? We have certainly implemented a range of legislative initiatives. Some of them took a while to get up, particularly the privative clause. We introduced a 35-day time limit on applications. We sought to limit access to class actions because of the impact that they could have in allowing people who were simply wanting to remain here to get on the in and get a bridging visa offered. We asserted that the codes of procedures for decision makers ought to have primacy. Additionally, we have made use of federal magistrates, and we have continued to work cooperatively with the Federal Court to find ways of streamlining its review processes. The time for resolution of matters within the Federal Court has dropped from 264 days to 154 days last year as a result of the measures that we have been implementing. That is a reduction of almost four months.I am interested in other policies. I went back to try to find where there were other policies. I had to go back some way because there have not been any policies forthcoming from the opposition while they have been in opposition. But I did find a press release from Senator Nick Bolkus, in which he was referring to some comments of a chief justice. I must say that nothing is new, to find people wanting to express views. - I have to be very careful, Prime Minister. I am only going to quote somebody else. The press release states:The Chief Justice of the Family Court has clearly not checked his facts before making comments on children in detention the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus said today.'Ill-informed and factually inaccurate statements are damaging to the office of the Chief Justice of the Family Court,' Senator Bolkus said.'To describe the Port Hedland centre as a `virtual concentration camp' is nothing short of emotional and sensationalist nonsense. The centre at Port Hedland is designed to keep family units together with appropriate comfort and dignity while they remain in detention. In particular, an extensive range of high level medical and educational services is provided,' Senator Bolkus said.His description - and again I think he was speaking about what the judge had to say -  of the northwest of Australia as `wilderness and remote' typifies an all too common view by people out of touch with mainstream Australia that anywhere outside metropolitan Sydney or Melbourne is not civilised,' Senator Bolkus said.He went on to say:'There are already provisions under the law to release minors from detention, where it is in the best interests of the child and this has been done. There can be no excuse for such a senior member of the judiciary to be ignorant of such a basic point.He also had some comments to make about the question of processing. He said:The real delay in the refugee determination process occurs when failed applicants decide to pursue litigation. It is the litigation process before the courts that can take years, not the merits determination process.'To those comments, I could only say, `Amen.'</DOC>

 - As to the first part of the question, I have full confidence in the Minister for Family and Community Services. If recollection serves me correctly, a lot of the legislative work in relation to this issue was put in place before she assumed her current duties, so I think that ought to be borne in mind. - I am following the point of order dictum of the member for Lilley. I am going directly to the very question that was asked by the Leader of the Opposition. He asked me to express confidence in the minister. I do. She is a competent, robust and articulate minister in whom I have very great confidence.A government member - Don't take her on! - I will stand aside and let the Leader of the Opposition have a go. -  - They've got us on the ropes again. In relation to the second part of the question, I dared to assume in the earlier answer from the attitude being taken by the opposition that, if the opposition were concerned about a lack of flexibility in one aspect of the operation of the system and if it were necessary to legislate in order to give greater flexibility, they would not oppose that legislation. If the opposition were to choose to oppose that legislation as they opposed the revenue fountainhead of the increased family benefits - namely, tax reform - then that would be on their heads. But I cannot imagine that, even an opposition as poorly led as this one -  - I was making an assumption - and perhaps it was a heroic assumption - that the opposition would behave logically as well as reasonably. I think that, given the track record of this opposition leader, those assumptions are supremely heroic.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. When the government reformed the financial system coming out of the Wallis report, we introduced the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act and the Payment System Board. Under that act, which was passed in 1998, the Reserve Bank has the capacity to designate a payment system if it believes that that is in the public interest. In April 2001, the Reserve Bank designated the Visa, Mastercard and Bankcard schemes as being subject to regulation under that act and, since then, has been working towards a standard to regulate the fees which the banks charge each other in operating this payment system.Today the final report was handed down and three substantive recommendations have been made. The first is that the interchange fee, which is currently around 0.95 per cent of the value of each credit card transaction, be reduced and set according to a methodology which will bring it down to 0.55 to 0.6 per cent - a reduction of about 40 per cent in interchange fees that the banks charge each other under these credit card systems. Based on the annual current revenue, it is estimated that this will reduce interchange fees which are charged by banks by $300 million to $400 million per annum. I call on the Australian banks to accept that decision and, as a consequence, to allow the users of credit cards the value of that reduction in their fees, which is estimated at $300 million to $400 million once the reforms take effect.The second recommendation relates to the common practice, even where expensive forms of credit are used under what is called the no-surcharge rule, for the costs of that to be recovered through prices against all consumers, even if they are not using credit card schemes. The bank's report today has called for abolition of that rule so that people who are not using an expensive credit card do not necessarily have to bear the costs of those who do. We have estimated that this should allow competitive pricing and, based on experience in the United Kingdom and the strong competitiveness of the Australian retail sector, the government does not expect that surcharging for credit will be widespread. The third recommendation which has been made as part of this landmark report is to open up the credit card system to even greater competition - that is, once somebody is approved for prudential reasons by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, they can have access to that system as a new competitor. This will allow new competitors other than banks to come in, with the prospect that they will give better service or lower charges, just as happened when the government opened up the mortgage market to mortgage originators who came in and gave new competition to the banks. These are very important reforms which will make our system more competitive. Also, there has been a suspicion in the past that banks have been directing customers to the use of credit because it is an expensive instrument when they could be promoting in preference debit cards, which are a less expensive form of financing. If these reforms have the effect of reducing the preference that the banks have had hitherto for directing their customers to credit cards - which are an expensive form of financing - that, too, will be a welcome thing. These are very significant reforms flowing from the government's response to the Wallis inquiry and government members welcome these reforms. We believe that all of the reforms should take place simultaneously - that is, on 1 July 2003 - and that is a point I will be putting to the Payment System Board and the Reserve Bank as part of our response. Strangely enough, we have even had a statement from the ALP welcoming these changes - one of the few times I have ever seen the ALP support a government initiative. We will be waiting to see whetheror not that will last until the time of introduction. These reforms, I expect, will be opposed by the credit card issuers - Mastercard and Visa. I understand that they do not support these recommendations; no doubt, they will be putting that view. Government members welcome these reforms. If the ALP can maintain its support in relation to these matters, we expect that good reforms arising out of the government's changes - which will make our system more competitive and should give benefits to consumers - will be implemented as a result of good policy.</DOC>

 - The request made by the member for Lilley flies completely in the face of the basis of everything I said - that is that, if people were overpaid money, they should pay it back. It is as simple as that. - It is based upon the simple proposition that if, at the end of the year at the time of reconciliation, you are found to owe the Commonwealth something, that should be paid back; if, at the end of the year at the time of reconciliation, the Commonwealth is found to owe you something, that should be paid to you. What I have said - and I repeat it - is that, if there is a capacity under the existing law to provide greater flexibility in relation to that, we will have a look at it. But the idea of revisiting past arrangements is unrealistic and contrary to what I have said. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real interest. He chairs the relevant committee that, on behalf of the coalition, works very closely with me and Wilson Tuckey in taking forward reforms and initiatives for rural and regional Australia. AusLink is our plan for a more carefully thought through and integrated approach to infrastructure planning nationally. It has been widely welcomed by most stakeholders who recognise that we do need a better, higher performing and integrated national land transport network. The current approach to transport planning, which it has to be said is a relic left over from the last century, will simply not meet the challenges of the future - with a doubling of the transport task over the next 15 to 20 years, with greater expectations in terms of amenity and with the real issues we will face with urban congestion, fuel consumption and, of course, environmental problems. A far better approach is needed.At the recent Australian Transport Council meeting in Auckland I discussed AusLink with my state and territory ministerial colleagues, who had - I do not think it is any secret - expressed some interest but at times concerns about my approach. We also met with the Australian Local Government Association, which has been a strong supporter of a better way forward. I am delighted to inform the House that we have agreed to move forward collaboratively, and I have agreed to convene a special meeting of the ATC and the Australian Logistics Council prior to finalisation of the AusLink green paper.  - I get an interjection from my opposite number, who says `another backflip'. It is just the opposite. - We are making real progress for the first time in this country towards an integrated national plan for transport. AusLink will form the basis for forging improved cross-modal links, for improving logistics and for making our national transport network far more efficient and more effective as a driver and an enabler for economic growth in the future. In a sense, that is the most important aspect of this. We are breaking the sort of narrow next-election focused cycle in this country. Just as we have gone beyond the next electoral cycle in setting the country up for future economic growth with economic reforms and industrial relations reforms, and just as the Treasurer and the government have taken us forward with the Intergenerational Report and are seeking to set the country up for an ageing population and the policy decisions that are needed there, in transport we are moving to ensure that our network meets the future needs of the nation both as an enabler and a driver of economic growth. Indeed, logistics now account for a massive nine per cent of the total economy. We have to get it right. We will be releasing a green paper shortly, followed by a white paper in April or so next year, followed by a new intergovernmental agreement. I was asked about alternative policies. For a long time I did not think we had one, because the member for Batman's position on this was that we had stolen one of their policies. I am not quite sure how we managed that, because I have not seen any for a long time. For a long time the member for Batman claimed that all we had done was lift Labor policy. However, he has now opened up a front of differentiation: he is saying that, although we are talking here about Commonwealth money, the Commonwealth should not have the final decision on how Commonwealth transport dollars are actually allocated. I find that absurd until I contemplate that, of course, in government the member for Batman would have to go and ask the permission of the ACTU first.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question and for the concern he has to boost job creation by small business in his electorate. This government wants to completely exempt small business from the operation of the unfair dismissal laws because, as survey after survey has shown, fear of an unfair dismissal claim is preventing the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs. A recent survey by the Restaurant and Catering Association, which has been presented to a Senate committee, shows that 38 per cent of businesses in that industry have had to defend an unfair dismissal claim in the last three years. On average, defending those claims has cost those businesses nearly $4,000 per claim and, worse, has taken up on average 63 hours of management time per claim.There is a problem here, and at last the opposition have acknowledged it through the member for Hotham's bill. But on this issue the opposition have to be the ultimate slow learners. No fewer than 21 times in the last six years has this government tried to reform the unfair dismissal laws - and 21 times we have been opposed by members opposite. Twenty-one times we have proposed reform, and 21 times it has been opposed by members opposite. When it comes to real reform, opposition intransigence is likely to just get worse as union influence grows under the Hawke-Wran recommendations. The Hawke-Wran report said:  the Party nationally should require each MP to enter into a formal ongoing consultative process with union activists -  - Opposition intransigence is going to get worse as the unions get more influence under the Hawke-Wran report, because it requires that each MP should: enter into a formal ongoing consultative process with union activists  in their electorate  [These] new arrangements could take the form of a regular monthly or quarterly session open to all union activists No consultation with small businesses, but monthly consultations with union activists. - Then there is the fact that the union block vote at national conferences is going to increase from zero per cent to 50 per cent. - Mr Speaker, thank you for that. If members opposite want to demonstrate that the unions are no longer relevant, they will get serious about this issue, they will get serious about helping small business and they will support the government's fair dismissal bill.</DOC>

 - The government put in place the process which has led to today's decision. I have called on the banks to accept that decision and to pass it on, and I expect that that will be done. The government is certainly putting in place something that had never been contemplated under Labor in order to give benefit to the consumer. We do not believe that the credit card interchange fees should be cut for the benefit of banks. Obviously, the banks will not like it; it is $350 million to $400 million. We believe it should be done for the consumer, and that is why we have put this in place and why we have welcomed the decision. I expect that there will be opposition to this decision, as I said earlier, from some of the credit card providers. But we believe that this is important in the interests of consumers and that it should be passed on, and we welcome the decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his longstanding commitment to apprentices and training and, in particular, his support of Terry Welch in Welch Contracting - 25 years of supporting young people in the building industry and offering apprenticeships and training to them in Maroochydore. There are currently 334,000 Australians engaged in apprenticeships and training. Some 58 per cent of them are under the age of 25 and they are spread across 500 occupations. Australia, at 2.1 per cent of the working age population in terms of apprenticeship penetration, now has the fourth highest concentration in the world. In fact, one-third of all teenagers employed full time in this country are currently in apprenticeships and traineeships. For those, at least on this side, who are interested in traditional trades, traditional skills and apprenticeships, 128,000 of them are in traditional trades. That represents 38 per cent of all the new apprentices in Australia, while those trades represent about 13 per cent of employment in the labour market.I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Lake Hume Resort in Albury with the member for Farrer to present the minister's awards for excellence for employers in regional and rural Australia. We had 16 outstanding employers. Glenys Petherick from the Rose-a-Vern Hair Salon in Tumby Bay is waiting for the member for Grey to come in and get a haircut - she told me to tell you that. She also said to me, `We take on apprentices because we believe it changes the lives of young Australians.' The member for Page would know John Lynch Engineering in Coraki. He and his wife are benefiting from the way the Australian economy is going and they are able to take on even more apprentices and trainees.I am asked about other policies or statements, and in that regard I welcome to the training and apprenticeship portfolio the member for Grayndler. This means that the member for Grayndler is now apprenticed to the former Labor spokesperson on apprentices and training, the member for Kingston, who is missing in action at the moment.  Opposition members - He is right here! - There he is, Mr Speaker; there's the member for Kingston! So the key to success for Labor Party spokespersons on apprentices and training is to say absolutely nothing. In eight months, the member for Kingston did not ask me a single question about apprentices or about training. In fact I suspect the member for Reid said to him, `Mate, the key to success on the Labor side with apprentices is: bring in a book, just sit back and don't ask any questions.' The question is, in terms of training and apprentices, what do we know about the member for Grayndler as the Labor spokesperson for training and apprentices? I went to the Australian Political Almanac and for the member for Grayndler it says:Some of the most celebrated Labor factional battles of recent history have been won and lost by one man: Anthony Albanese.The member for Werriwa comes into this, Mr Speaker. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will with great pleasure. The almanac went on further to say:... Albanese likes to stress that he is also a policy enthusiast. - Thank you, Mr Speaker: in relation to apprentices and training, the member for Grayndler will no doubt be celebrating the fact that this government this year announced another 30,000 places for apprentices in schools at $31.7 million. It also announced another 25,000 places for innovation apprentices in microtechnologies, robotics, photonics and information communication technology. But I suspect the member for Werriwa does not share my enthusiasm or my optimism for the member for Grayndler. In fact, in relation to training and apprentice issues, he told 2GB on 14 December 1998:Anthony Albanese and that narrow faction of politics is more the problem than the solution for the Labor Party, and when it comes to policy he shows his form by just mouthing the tired old slogans you hear around the place.I said to a journalist earlier today, actually Eric, that if anyone -  -  - In conclusion, the assessment given by the member for Werriwa of the Labor spokesman for apprentices and training - </DOC>

 - I am aware of the report to which the honourable member for Gellibrand refers and, like her, I am concerned at the apparent failure in many states for some time of child protection policies. Although it so happens at the moment that all of the states are governed by Labor administrations, this failure stretches back to earlier years. I had experience as a local member of some instances of the failure of the current arrangements which adversely affected some of my constituents. As the honourable member will know, it is something that is the responsibility of the states. I will, however, give some consideration to raising the question of the states lifting their game at the next COAG meeting.We live in a federation - and I am, as my colleagues will know, no fanatical states rightist - and we have under this administration, in the teeth of fierce opposition from the Labor Party, put in place a taxation system which will give to the states of Australia growing amounts of revenue. I want to make it very clear that, if there is an inadequacy of money for child abuse policy in this country, that is 100 per cent the responsibility and the failure of successive state governments, whether they be Labor or Liberal. The idea of having some kind of -  - The member asked me a question. I gave it a very direct, explicit and constructive answer. Her interjection merely indicates that she is not really interested in the issue, that she is just trying to score a cheap political point.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for another question on small business. This government recognise the importance of small business to the Australian economy, to our economic future and to our prosperity. That is why we introduced a tax reform package some years ago that delivered lower company tax, reduced excises and reduced income tax. It also halved capital gains tax, abolished provisional tax, abolished financial institutions duty and a range of other measures. The package was opposed by the Labor Party, which comes as no surprise, because we, on this side of the House, believe that small business creates jobs; on that side of the House, the Labor Party believe in political opportunism.The Yellow Pages survey released today is sobering news. It found that small businesses are experiencing positive growth in most areas, particularly in employment and capital expenditure. That is great news, but more needs to be done, particularly in relation to workplace relations changes which were touched on by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations a little earlier. The survey found that, when it comes to attitudes to federal government policies, our current level of support from small business is four times better than Labor's best ever result in February 1994. In August 1995, when Labor was still in office, its approval rating with small business was minus 60 per cent. Disturbingly, the Yellow Pages survey found:... the Western Australian Labor government continued to be the least supported government with an approval rating of minus 31 per cent.The most significant concern identified by small and medium-sized enterprises about the Western Australian government was that it took too much notice of the unions. This is a warning for the member for Hotham. The Western Australian government wound back the workplace relations reforms and has always focused on the interests of the unions ahead of those of small business.Obviously, as part of the survey, there were questions for small business, and I found this quote from the Executive Director of the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association of Western Australia, Mr Terry Bright. His members were concerned that an outfit such as the Coffin Cheaters bikie gang could be authorised as a representative to access the workplace and see financial records of businesses even if no complaint was registered and there were no union members there. He said:There is no level of competency that these people need to be called union representatives.If it gives Mr Bright any comfort, there is no competency test to become a member of the parliamentary Labor Party either. Of course, Labor Senator Gavin Marshall said, `Unionists are part of the moral bedrock of this country.' In Western Australia, the Coffin Cheaters bikie gang fits within the definition of unionists under Western Australian Labor Party legislation. This Yellow Pages survey is a warning to the member for Hotham that, if he keeps giving the unions more power, he will not be able to cheat the political coffin.</DOC>

 - I will respond to the member for Fremantle in two ways. I will give a general response now, which is positive to the point that she made, and for her benefit and for the benefit of other members I will give a more detailed response when I have had the opportunity to get further advice about what the government has done. I do not pretend to carry in my head the full details of everything the government has done.The member for Fremantle has referred to a problem that has been ignored for too long. It has been ignored by governments and oppositions for too long through fear of seeming to give offence to Aboriginal communities and through fear of being accused of singling out Aboriginal people in relation to domestic violence. I think there was a real breakthrough on this issue when Evelyn Scott, who was the Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in the wake of some of the statements that were made in 2000 by other Aboriginal leaders, raised - the first time it was raised by an Aboriginal leader in a serious way - the concern that she felt about the level of domestic violence in Aboriginal communities. I think it is far too high and, if the question asked by the member for Fremantle suggests that there will be a degree of bipartisan intent to deal with this problem, I welcome it. I know her interest in it and I accept that she is interested in it. I ask her to accept that I am. I ask her to accept that, as I hope to outline when I give her more details, there has been already some focus on this issue within the government's domestic violence programs.I think there are chronic levels of alcoholism in Aboriginal communities. I think there are chronic levels of substance abuse. That is not to say there is not domestic violence, substance abuse and alcoholism in other communities - I hasten to say that; of course there is - but the incidence and the level appear higher in Aboriginal communities, and that has to be said. It has to be said very directly and very firmly. As far as I am concerned, there should be a far greater emphasis, in the money that is already made available to ATSIC, on programs for combatting  domestic violence. As you invite me to say something, I would say to ATSIC, `It is in your gift and your power to give more money to domestic violence and less money to other things, and I ask that you do it.' I hope that I might have the support of the opposition in doing that. I hope that the opposition would support it.Domestic violence is a huge problem in Aboriginal communities. It is a problem in the community. I do not for a moment suggest that it is restricted to the Aboriginal community and I do not suggest for a moment that it is restricted to any particular socioeconomic group in the general community - so let us get that right out of the way right at the very beginning. It is a sickening area of human behaviour and something that has always revolted me. I think it would revolt men and women on both sides of this parliament. So, if the member for Fremantle is seeking a response in principle to the issue, I have given it. As to more details, I will obtain them. I will write her a letter and I will make the letter available to all honourable members.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to be able to inform the House that, since the introduction of Work for the Dole in 1997, this month we have racked up 10,433 different projects right around Australia, assisting Australian communities and assisting individuals to better themselves, to help themselves and to improve the communities of which they are part. There is not one member on this side of the House who has not seen with their own eyes the benefit that this can make to individuals in their own electorates. - We hear comments such as this by a Western Australian participant:I met some really interesting people, we did work we never thought we would be doing. It was a big boost to my self-esteem. Now I have a job and I am back to my confident self.These are the sorts of comments that lift people on this side, and all we get are disparaging comments from those opposite. Here is another comment from a Work for the Dole participant:I enjoyed Work for the Dole. It is horrible being unemployed because you get tired of looking for work and start to fall into a slump. At least I now have a reason for getting out of bed in the morning.This comment is from the community of Dudley in New South Wales:The restoration of our hall was made possible through Work for the Dole. All work was completed admirably by the Work for the Dole participants. They were committed to the activity and made a wonderful contribution.Doesn't that say it all about the things they are doing in their communities?The question from the member for Farrer also asks whether I am aware not of other policies but of other examples of mutual obligation under way. As I was leaving the dispatch box last week, having brought the House's attention to the fact that New Labour in Great Britain actually supports mutual obligation, I heard this weird comment from the opposition leader. He said, `I'm all for mutual obligation.' The member for Werriwa over there said, `That's my idea.' That got me to thinking. I went back and checked the web site, and there is no indication of the Australian Labor Party supporting Work for the Dole or mutual obligation. I have to inform the House that I have undersold the Leader of the Opposition. Not only is he a supporter of mutual obligation; it turns out that he is an active participant in mutual obligation. The Leader of the Opposition is actively participating in mutual obligation right now, as we speak. I see the Prime Minister is somewhat bemused by this too. As mutual obligation goes, we pay the unemployed income support and in return they pay back to the community by working two days a week. This is a great mutual obligation that we have built on over the years. But the mutual obligation that we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition is where we see the trade unions paying millions of dollars into the coffers of the Labor Party and in return the Labor Party -  -  - What I would like to bring to the House's attention is that, whilst not supporting the government's mutual obligation, the fact is that the Leader of the Opposition each and every day sits in this place, receives a financial payment from the unions to the party - </DOC>

 - In relation to those figures, I will not try and answer them on the run because I do not, frankly, know the answer without getting advice. It is my broad understanding that a percentage of the domestic violence program - I think about 10 per cent of the domestic violence program, which the honourable member will understand is a greater proportion than the proportion of the Indigenous community in the total population - was allocated to Indigenous programs. That is the domestic violence program separately and apart from anything ATSIC might have provided. I hope that she would accept that that is in earnest of us giving more than just a proportionate recognition of the problem. I will get some more details of the figures; I just do not have them with me.</DOC>

 - My thanks to the member for Gilmore for asking this very important question about what this government has been able to do to assist young people, particularly in rural areas, to develop their skills. The government has launched a range of major new initiatives to help young people who want to make a career of agriculture, particularly those between the ages of 18 and 35 years. Amongst those initiatives has been a series of rural leadership training courses that have been held in Canberra over the last couple of years. I am pleased to welcome to the gallery today the participants in the latest of those leadership courses, 40 young people who have come from every state of Australia to participate in a program to help develop their skills and to ensure that Australian rural communities have the quality of leaders that will be necessary to help drive them forward in the years ahead. The other initiatives that have been launched include director training programs, awards for projects in science and study programs for young people and a series of other networks to support them in achieving their potential.Later this afternoon we will be launching the Young Australian Rural Network, a web site for young people who are participating in rural industry. It is www.yarn.gov.au, for anyone who is interested and who would like to participate. It will give young people, the rural leaders of the community, an opportunity to have a say in the development of government policy and the issues of the day as well as to network and to learn from one another about the sorts of things that are happening in agricultural life. They have been involved in developing this site and putting together the mechanisms to make it work. I encourage members of the House who are interested in young people in rural areas and would like to give them some support to check the site and examine its capabilities to support the leadership potential of those people in their communities who will go on to be major leaders of agriculture in the years ahead. I welcome the participants in the leadership course to Canberra and I thank them for their role in developing this important new initiative for rural Australians. </DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is that we are both correct and you are wrong. That is the answer. As we indicated yesterday, we are looking at ways of making the system more flexible. At this stage, I am not going to rule individual options in or out, but what I am stating is that two principles remain: if you receive an overpayment, that should be paid back and, if you are underpaid, at the reconciliation time there should be a top-up. The other principle is that we are dealing here, as Senator Vanstone said - in what I might say was an excellent Lateline interview last night -  -  - As honourable members know, I watch that program every night. I came home from a very pleasant dinner, I turned on my television set and there was Senator Vanstone being interviewed by Tony Jones. I thought she did extremely well. She made it very clear that what we are dealing with here is a tax benefit and, when you are dealing with a tax benefit, it is only fair and reasonable and logical that it be dealt with inter alia in the context of tax assessments. I made it clear yesterday, and I repeat here today, that the use of taxation refunds to recover amounts owing to the Commonwealth that have been overpaid is a perfectly reasonable thing. It is something which the Labor Party did when it was in office.Could I also insert into the record a figure that I think is pretty relevant to this: on current indications - and there are only broad indications at the present - we are likely to have about 600,000 cases of repayment at the time of reconciliation. But, by comparison, we are going to have about 400,000 examples of where people are going to receive more money because they have been underpaid during the course of the year. So I repeat: we are not going to rule individual propositions about making the thing more flexible in or out. We are looking at making the system more flexible, but that flexibility will be consistent with the principle that, if you are overpaid, you have got to pay it back and, if you are underpaid, you are entitled to a top-up. And because it is a tax benefit, it is only reasonable that tax refunds be part of the reconciliation process.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. As the House knows only too well, the government is deeply concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe - a view that I know is shared not only by many members of the House but also by many of their constituents. The Prime Minister, as honourable members know, at the moment is the Chairman-In-Office of the Commonwealth, and he has worked very effectively with his troika partners, the President of South Africa and the President of Nigeria, in suspending Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth on 19 March last year. At that time, the troika gave President Mugabe every opportunity to respond to the requirements of the March Marlborough House declaration. They were that the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Don McKinnon, should engage President Mugabe and that President Mugabe should undertake reconciliation within Zimbabwe, including with the opposition there, through the specially appointed troika representatives from Nigeria and South Africa. The fact is that President Mugabe has not responded positively to any of these proposals. The specially appointed troika representatives have not been able to take forward any process of effective reconciliation, and the Secretary-General has not been able to engage with President Mugabe. As at this point in time, the Australian government is maintaining close contact with the South African and Nigerian governments, exploring what further action the troika, as the leaders of the Commonwealth, might be able to take under the auspices of the Commonwealth. As we have said on many occasions, we are actively retaining our option to introduce the smart sanctions that we flagged some time ago but, as we have also pointed out, the timing and context of any triggering of those smart sanctions is significant. Obviously, we must take into consideration the progress being made - if further progress can be made - through the Commonwealth troika process. President Mugabe's land policies amount to not only an exercise in what could be described as ethnic cleansing but an attack on the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe and on the region of southern Africa more broadly. A UN Food and Agricultural Organisation report released to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa says that close to 13 million people in southern Africa are in need of emergency food aid and, incredibly, around six million of those 13 million live in Zimbabwe alone. Of course the drought has contributed to this crisis - and nobody would detract from that - but the depletion of grain reserves and a poor economic performance have been very significant factors. The FAO report says:In Zimbabwe, reduced planting in the large scale commercial sector due to land reform activities compounded the problem [of low crop yields].Zimbabwe's bad land policies have impacted on the region's entire food market. It is estimated that only one-quarter of would-be settlers, those who have been given land in the so-called land reform pursued by President Mugabe, have actually taken up their plots, or had done so by mid-August of this year. Many of those people have no farming skills or, indeed, are able to afford essential seed or fertiliser.It is significant that the former finance minister of Zimbabwe, who has now been dismissed, Mr Makoni, told the Zimbabwe parliament on 1 August that the agriculture sector in Zimbabwe would shrink by nearly 25 per cent this year. The Commercial Farmers Union says that commercial agriculture will fall by 40 per cent and maize production by 66 per cent. Without the commercial farming sector, it is estimated that Zimbabwe can only sustain about one-quarter of its population.The Australian government have committed $26 million to addressing the serious humanitarian needs of southern and eastern Africa, including Zimbabwe, but we do remain deeply concerned by reports that the government of Zimbabwe is manipulating the distribution of food it has itself procured. The government are not seeking to penalise starving people for poor governance in their countries. We are confident that food provided by donors is getting, in most cases, to the most needy. But the fact is that the government of Zimbabwe itself - and, in particular, the President of Zimbabwe - has, through the pursuit of its policies, done enormous damage to the welfare of ordinary people in Zimbabwe. It is a matter we remain deeply concerned about, and we will continue to do all we can to try to achieve a better result, as best the international community can, for the people of Zimbabwe.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition chooses to employ the expression `strip your tax return', hoping to create the impression in the community that the Commonwealth is claiming something that it is not entitled to claim. - That is what the Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to do, and I am pointing it out for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of the Australian public. Where there is a repayment obligation to the Commonwealth, and particularly where that is within the taxation system, it has long been the policy of government to claim that back at refund time. It was made very clear in the legislation, it was made very clear in the Tax Pack, and what the government is doing is totally unexceptional.The Leader of the Opposition can use emotive words such as `stripping tax returns', endeavouring to create an impression that something is being taken to which there is no entitlement, but let me simply restate the principle that, where there is an overpayment, it is only fair that that money be recovered and, where there is an underpayment, it is only fair that people who have been underpaid get their payments topped up. That is a statement of a very fair, even and, I think, totally acceptable approach. Surely the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him on this issue are not suggesting that a family living in one part of Australia that gets exactly what it is entitled to should then be asked to accept a situation where a family that is entitled to exactly the same amount of money gets paid a significantly greater amount and is then given an opportunity to retain that.Last year, because it was the first year of the introduction of the system and we were in a transitional phase, there was a waiver of $1,000. I think that was entirely appropriate, and I think those who sit behind me would agree that it was entirely appropriate that we should have that waiver. But now that the system is more familiar to people - and it is a system, I might say, that is infinitely more generous than anything that was provided by the former government - it is only fair that, if people get paid more than they are entitled to, we ask for it back and that, if there is a capacity to set that off against a tax refund that is due to them, because it is a tax benefit, that set-off occurs. I think most people would regard that as perfectly reasonable, and they would regard it as equally reasonable that, if somebody has been underpaid because they have overestimated their income, they get a top-up at reconciliation time and end up getting a bigger tax refund. For the life of me I cannot understand what is unfair about that. If we were actually saying to people, `We're not going to allow you to keep what you're entitled to,' then the opposition would have a point. We are not saying that. I indicated yesterday that if there are ways of making the system more flexible, consistent with the broad principles I have outlined, then we are going to try and do that. At this stage, I am not going to rule particular propositions in or out. I also remind the House, for their interest, that on present trends you are looking at about 400,000 families getting a top-up and perhaps 600,000 being obliged to make some kind of repayment. That represents what was always in contemplation at the time the system was established. If it can be made more flexible we will do so. I have to say to the opposition: whatever you say about this and whatever points you raise, you cannot gainsay the fact that this is a far more generous family tax benefit system than ever obtained under your administration. The Australian public clearly recognises it now, as they clearly recognised it just over nine months ago when, in electorates where the vote particularly of young families was very important, they supported the government in an overwhelming fashion. That is the political reality for the Leader of the Opposition, and nothing he or his mate from Lilley says in this debate is going to alter that fact. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Having spoken in this House recently about the very substantial and welcome recovery in the aviation sector in this country over the last 12 months, it is very regrettable indeed that we now face the fact that there will be further significant disruptions to air services this coming Friday. This is not in the interests of the aviation sector. It is certainly not in the interests of the travelling public or the tourism industry. We ought to remember that the tourism industry now employs some half a million people across Australia. We desperately need to recover our reputation internationally as a very desirable and reliable place to visit. Yet, despite this, we know that the air traffic controller union, Civil Air, has given notice that it intends to take stop-work action from 5 p.m. on Friday for a period of five hours. This has been calculated to cause maximum disruption. There is no doubt about that. It will have the effect of grounding all flights, with the possible exception of accident and emergency operations. This is not the time to be engaging in this sort of industrial thuggery. The actions are vastly disproportionate - An opposition member - When is the time? - When is it okay? Is the honourable member opposite suggesting that it is wise at a time like this when the industry is just recovering, when you have 500,000 people employed in the tourism industry all looking for a significant improvement in the prospects for their industry? What ought to be noted about this is that the proposed actions are grossly disproportionate to the grievance. Until the vote was taken last week, both sides - Civil Air and Airservices - had essentially agreed to the new agreement and the fact that it ought to go forward. Yet you now have a dispute over sick leave and the number of days leave that air traffic controllers can take. The effect of these actions far outweighs the effective level of grievance.I think it is worth noting in this place that the member for the Batman and the Leader of the Opposition have said nothing at any time about this. They have not sought in any way to dissuade this irresponsible and disproportionate industrial action that will do a lot of damage to aviation and tourism at a time when we ought to be looking to lock in the recovery. Never mind the Hawke-Wran review, this really tells you quite clearly who still runs the ALP. Another example of this is provided by the MUA. Members of the House might be aware that the MUA is currently running a pretty disgusting industrial campaign over the issue of coastal trading permits. The MUA enjoys, it has to be said, the strong support of the member for Batman. He is right in there with them. Actually he is having a bob each way. There is a 50-50 rule here because he also supports the government's policy of shipping permits - he has said so. I am advised that in response to a question at the Shipping Australia lunch as to whether permits would continue under a Labor government, the shadow ministry replied that permits would continue to be issued but shippers would have to demonstrate they could obtain Australian shipping. That is precisely the policy position that applies now and that we deploy. It is no different. Foreign ships are only permitted to carry coastal cargoes when Australian licence vessels are not available. There has been no change in the law from the time when they operated it to now. The fact is that the member for Batman supports the government's policy on the one hand and supports the MUA policy on the other hand. It is a true 50-50 split and a real relic of the past. </DOC>

 - I think I recall a reference to mass marketed schemes. You played the George Gear card yesterday -  - Double standards! George Gear was the Assistant Treasurer - I do not think it was of the Howard government; I think he was -  - I do not think that we should spend too much time on George Gear in answering this question. The position is - as I have restated and let me state it again in case the Leader of the Opposition is having a little trouble coming to grips with what is involved - there is no debt crisis. What is involved is the possibility of some greater flexibility in a system that is delivering family tax benefits of the like that no Australian government in the past has delivered. I can only repeat that they will continue to be delivered in the generous way they have been in the past. If there are ways in which the system can be made more flexible, we will adopt them. If there is an overpayment, we would seek to have that overpayment addressed. If there is an underpayment, we would continue to address that. It is entirely proper, because it is a tax benefit, that the taxation system - particularly the assessment processes of the taxation system - be involved. I acknowledge the nod of approval from the member for Batman, and I agree. The member for Batman obviously regards this as an entirely proper and fair approach, and I welcome that. It is a good amendment of life in him. There is no crisis. There is a flailing around by the Leader of the Opposition to find some kind of issue on which to get a little bit of traction, and that is not working. We are going to see whether there is a bit more flexibility and, when we have determined that, we will make an announcement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his interest in the Australian economy. I can report to the House today that the current account deficit for the June quarter was $7.5 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, which was up from $5.2 billion in the March quarter. For the quarter, the deficit was around 4.1 per cent of GDP, which is larger than it was in June of last year, when it was two per cent, but smaller than it was in June the year before, when it was 4.5 per cent. In the quarter, exports of goods and services fell slightly, although rural goods were almost unchanged. I expect that the effects of the drought have not yet flowed into rural exports; the outcome for the quarter showed that they were unchanged in March, but you would expect an effect in future quarters. Imports of goods and services were higher, rising six per cent in the June quarter. In particular, that was on the back of strong, continuing imports for civil aircraft - the renewal of the Qantas fleet and quite possibly, too, the government's civil aircraft fleet, which came through in those figures. Net exports are expected to subtract about 1.3 per cent from the national accounts which are due next week.This is consistent with the story of the economy as we have been reading it over recent times - that is, Australia is growing faster than any of the advanced industrial economies. But we are not immune from world developments having an effect on exports - meaning that net exports will contract, notwithstanding the strength of the Australian domestic economy in relation to housing and retail and confidence generally.Australia's net foreign debt was $329 billion in the June quarter, 47 per cent of GDP, down from the peak of 50 per cent in the March quarter of last year. The debt servicing ratio continues at low levels, being around 9.2 per cent in the June quarter unchanged from March. It is certainly as strong as it has been going back to the pre-banana republic of Mr Keating - the pre-1985 and 1986 days. I am sure that both sides of the House will welcome that.We will be getting the national accounts next week which will give us the latest fix on the Australian economy. As I have been saying on numbers of occasions, we will not be immune from world developments, particularly the developments in the United States economy - the engine of global growth - but Australia stands much better prepared to cope with those developments and particularly to cope with the export downturn because of tax reforms which have taken taxes off exports, given our exporters a better opportunity in world markets and enabled them to cope with difficult trading conditions.</DOC>

 - As I said earlier, Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio was 47 per cent in the June quarter. Australia's foreign debt since 1996 has been around 40 to 47 per cent. So that is an increase, in percentage terms, of about seven per cent on 40. Just to get some perspective on debt, in June 1983 the debt-to-GDP ratio in Australia was 14 per cent -   - No, we are on foreign debt, I am afraid. In June 1983 the foreign debt-to-GDP ratio was 14 per cent. After 13 years of Labor government it had trebled to 40 per cent. If this government had a record like the Labor Party's, instead of now having a 47 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio, the ratio would be 120 per cent. That is why we love questions from the Labor Party on debt. They are called a `Kylie' in the parlance - I should be so lucky as to get a question on debt from the Labor Party! But not only that. That area of debt which the government is most responsible for - namely, Commonwealth government debt - has fallen from the Labor Party height of 20 per cent to under five per cent today. I guess one of the things that most Australians now recognise about the coalition economic management is not only have we been able to repay debt but we have now repaid $62 billion of Labor Party debt - and that is Commonwealth government debt - by making Australia in one of the strongest positions in the world. - The Leader of the Opposition has made another Kylie interjection. He says, `By selling assets.' The Labor Party sold assets, expended them, ran a deficit and still ran up debt after taking into account asset sales. When the Labor Party sold the Commonwealth Bank, it sold off the asset, expended it, still ran a $10 billion deficit and ran up debt at the same time as it sold assets. I do not think the enormity of the mismanagement over those last five years of Labor government has yet dawned on the Leader of the Opposition - who, in all fairness, does not pretend to be a great student of economics. Labor sold assets, expended the proceeds, ran a deficit and, after allowing for the proceeds of asset sales, still ran up debt by $80 billion. The coalition, which was elected to do a job, has now repaid $62 billion of Labor Party debt. That has put Australia in a stronger position. We are one of the strongest economies of the Western world. That is what economic management does, and that is where Labor failed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question on school funding, for his very strong commitment in particular to the building of a high school at Kariong and his longstanding support for getting resources into Avoca Beach Public School and all the schools in his electorate.Government state schools are called state schools in many parts of the country because they are regulated, administered and primarily funded by state governments. In fact, as the federal minister for education, I am not able to visit a state government school without the permission of the state minister. So in New South Wales, for example, I write, `Dear Mr Watkins, please may I visit Kingswood High School?' Across Australia, there are 2.27 million students attending government state schools. They represent 69 per cent of the students in school education. The state government schools receive in total about 84 per cent of their funding from state and territory governments; about four per cent of the funding comes from the hard work and sacrifices of parents, through cake stalls and raffles; and then about 12 per cent of the funding for state government schools comes from the Commonwealth government. It is important that, this year, the Howard government increased its funding to support the state governments to fund their schools by 5.7 per cent. -  - That is right: it has gone up to $2.4 billion this year, which will be added to the $12 billion contributed by the state and territory governments. I have had my department, with my support and assistance, look very carefully at the funding made available by state and territory governments to their schools. Every state and territory government budget has now been delivered. The Commonwealth has increased funding to government state schools by 5.7 per cent. Not one state or territory government in this country has increased the funding to its state government schools by as much as the 5.7 per cent increase delivered by the Commonwealth government this year. That 5.7 per cent increase in funding brings to 52 per cent, over a six-year period, the increase in funding from the Commonwealth government to state schools, when enrolments increased by only 1.4 per cent.I have established a league table of state and territory governments to rank them against the Commonwealth's performance. All those state and territory governments - every single one of them - are below the Commonwealth's performance. For example, the missing millions total $478 million. If state and territory governments had increased their funding to their schools by as much as the Commonwealth did to support them, there would be $478 million available for state government schools. In the state of Victoria I visited the Seaford North Primary School recently with the member for Dunkley. There, at 9 o'clock in the morning, in rain, primary school students performed a rock eisteddfod in bare feet on cracked asphalt on a basketball court, when the Victorian government had increased its funding to those state government schools by only 2.9 per cent. Had it increased it by 5.3 per cent, as we did in the state of Victoria, there would be $95 million more available for state school students in the state of Victoria.If you go to South Australia, to the electorate of Grey, to the Orroroo Area School or if you go to the Gawler Public School, you will find that the Commonwealth government has already given to the state government of South Australia $1½ million to fund capital works in those schools. Not only has it not been spent; the state government has cut its funding for capital works in that state by 7.8 per cent and is holding the money. I am absolutely determined that we will force that state to spend Commonwealth money on Commonwealth funded projects in state schools. I am also asked about alternative policies. There was a polemic contribution to the Melbourne Age on 5 June this year by Labor's spokesperson on education.  - The member for Jagajaga. She said, in part, that the Commonwealth budget gives nothing new to government schools except annual adjustments to cover cost increases. That is absolutely wrong, because in the state of Victoria alone, as I said, there would have been $95 million more for state government schools. I see that the member for Canning is smiling. He knows all about the Armadale School. It could do with a bit of paint. If Western Australia had kept up with the Commonwealth, there would be another $8 million in Western Australia. So $478 million is missing from state and territory governments. The member for Jagajaga and the Labor Party need to turn the magnifying glass away from the Labor Party navel and apply it to state governments when it comes to education funding. There are two things that can fix this. The first thing that can fix this is political will, and the second thing that can fix it - which is also opposed by the Labor Party - is the GST. - Mr Speaker, I am prepared to table this document.</DOC>

 - I did see those comments. As a consequence, I had them followed up with the ANZ Bank and informed the ANZ Bank that certainly the government would not be tolerating any attempt to claw back that money from merchants. The ANZ told me - `categorically' is the word - that they would not be doing so, and sent me the media release that they put out in relation to the matter, which does not indicate that they would seek to be doing that by putting up other fees. What will happen, I expect, because the interchange fee does not allow for the costs of loyalty schemes and so on, is that some of these credit cards will have their loyalty schemes carved out of them, and that is totally consistent with the methodology which was proposed by the RBA. Interestingly enough, one of the complaints that the bank makes - I do not know if it is true - is that Qantas has recently put up the price of its loyalty schemes. So it will be interesting to see how that actually works out.What the government does expect, of course, is that the RBA methodology will be monitored by the RBA. The RBA has put that methodology in place, and the RBA will be expected to monitor compliance with it. The RBA has a very direct way of doing that with the banks. We will be looking for the Reserve Bank of Australia to do that, and I have no doubt that they will have the capacity.While I am on my feet, let me remind the House that I think there has been general welcome of these reforms. I think consumers have welcomed them. I think, mostly, retailers have welcomed them. The government welcomed them. And for a time, until you thought that you might have a political opportunity, even the Labor Party welcomed them. But I made the prediction yesterday that the Labor Party's bipartisan support would go very lukewarm as soon as they saw an opportunity. That is why I am interested to see you come back and try to distinguish yourself from the government, rather than giving the government the credit for putting in place the arrangements which brought this about.The arrangements which brought this about were the government's reform of the financial system and the introduction of the Payment System (Regulation) Act 1998 - which did not exist under 13 years of Labor government - which allowed the RBA to designate a payments scheme and to impose a methodology. That would not have been the case and in fact was not the case under 13 years of Labor government. That was a valuable reform. It has led to a new methodology. I think the Labor Party, deep in its heart, should acknowledge the way in which these reforms are now improving the financial system.It has always been a policy of this government to encourage new entrants into the financial system. That is why this government allowed building societies and credit unions access to the cheque system, which had not been the case under the Labor Party. Now we want to allow prudentially supervised new entrants into the credit system as well, which again was not allowed by the Labor Party. I pay tribute to the member for Wannon for the work that he has done in relation to this. I pay tribute to Stan Wallis and the reforms in his report and the introduction of the payment systems act under this government, which has allowed new entrants into the market - new entrants, new competition and better deals for consumers. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question and for his interest not only in financial institutions policy but also in relation to tax policy. I thank him for following these matters, which are important for Australia. They deserve a lot of interest and I am pleased to see that they get interest on this side of the House.When the Review of Business Taxation was done under the chairmanship of John Ralph, the review recommended the investigation of a new concept in relation to business taxation, which was known as the tax value method - sometimes known as option 2. It was a proposal essentially to rewrite the whole concept of how we would assess tax, by looking at the change in the tax value of assets during the year of assessment. The government referred this concept to the Board of Taxation in August 2000 for consultation and advice. The board has now reported to the government that there is significant industry concern about the cost and uncertainty associated with the tax value method; a widespread perception that whilst it might offer benefits in some areas, it would generate greater complexity and uncertainty in others; and that there would be substantial transitional costs for tax advisers and business moving to such a system. As a consequence, the board has recommended to the government that the government not proceed with the tax value method. The government has accepted that recommendation and no further work will be done in relation to the tax value method or in relation to option 2.The government will develop, in consultation with business, a systematic tax treatment of rights and black hole expenditures, with a view to implementing those changes by July 2005. I pay tribute to the Board of Taxation for the extensive work which it did in relation to this. It organised seminars; it consulted widely. It is an example of how the board has worked very successfully. It has come back to the government with a pretty widely supported recommendation and the government accepts it. I also pay tribute to John Ralph for the work that he did in reviewing Australia's business taxation system. That was a seminal report. - It has already formed the basis for many of the government's improvements to the company taxation system - improvements like cutting company tax; abolishing stamp duties on listed securities; abolishing financial institutions duty; cutting capital gains tax; allowing foreign tax-exempts to invest in venture capital, tax free here in Australia; and improvements in relation to rollover relief and the like. Those changes have been of enormous assistance to Australian business. Our reform program goes on, but the government will not be proceeding with the tax value method.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Calare, I can inform him that, when I heard of the inaccurate representation on this video, I sought advice about the implications of it, and I particularly had in mind the very research grant to which he has referred. I am not making any judgment. I am seeking advice, as is proper in the situation. It is incumbent on people who hold very respected scientific positions in this country to be very careful about the claims they make. As is well known in this parliament, I support the legislation which is now before the parliament - in fact, I introduced it. The revelations are disturbing to me, but they do not alter my support for the legislation. The fact that there may have been a misrepresentation does not in itself destroy the validity of the arguments that I have embraced in relation to the legislation, but that does not lessen my concern.The recommendation that the group to which Professor Trounson belongs receive the grant was made by an independent body and the government accepted the recommendation in good faith. I am not saying at this stage that any action in relation to that is necessary, but it is necessary that I get some advice. It is necessary for me, I hope without prejudicing the debate, to say that people who make scientific claims have to be absolutely careful in what they say. People who are advocating each side have to be very careful. I think there has been a talking up of some of the benefits of the science - by the New South Wales Premier, for example. There have been some claims made by Mr Carr that I think are unfairly raising expectations of what might accrue. I say that once again as somebody who is on the same side as Mr Carr in this debate.When you are dealing with people who have profound disabilities and whose expectation of a decent life is miserable, in my view you owe them two things: to do everything humanly possible to find a cure, if there is one available, for their disability; and not to unfairly inflate expectations. Everybody who comes to this debate has a responsibility to behave intelligently. This debate has brought out the best in this parliament. There have been some very fine contributions on both sides and it is a reminder to all of us and a reminder to the Australian public that this chamber can be a place of enlightened, impassioned and, I hope, constructive debate. </DOC>

 - I am glad to provide the evidence to the House, and I note in response to the member for Ryan's question that there are nearly 1,000 workers in his electorate who are enjoying the benefits of Australian workplace agreements under federal law. Thanks to the policies of this government, Australian workers are enjoying more jobs, higher pay and fewer strikes. There are nearly one million new jobs - since March 1996 - strikes are at the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913 and average weekly full-time earnings are up 12 per cent in real terms since 1996 - that is, 12 per cent in just six years compared to just five per cent over the previous 13 years under the former Labor government.These outstanding results have been driven by a big jump in labour productivity. Under this government's policies, labour productivity has increased on average by 2½ per cent a year. It increased by just 1½ per cent a year under members opposite. In turn, this productivity increase has been driven by two big cultural shifts. The first shift has been from industry to workplace bargaining, because every workplace is different. The second shift has been towards direct relationships between workers and managers, because Australian workers today do not need outsiders to tell them how to think and how to bargain.I note - and I am sure members opposite will be pleased to know - that fully 15 per cent of certified agreements registered under the federal act are now negotiated directly between workers and management without the involvement of a union. I am sure members opposite will be pleased to know that so far more than 250,000 Australian workplace agreements have been registered. The latest survey shows that, compared to similar workers, employees on AWAs feel more positive towards management, they feel less stressed, they feel more positive about their pay and conditions and they feel that they are more in control of their own working conditions. AWAs are good for workers, good for management, good for business and good for jobs. They are not necessarily good for unions, and that is why members opposite have promised to abolish AWAs if they ever get back into power. I table this document: Agreement making in Australia under the Workplace Relations Act.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note with interest and appreciation his newfound concern for the services that country people enjoy in the area of telecommunications. I will take the first part of the question on notice, because I am not in a position to be able to respond fully to his particular assertions. In relation to the latter, the point I want to make - and I think that it builds very much on the point that the Prime Minister made yesterday - is that the degree, the quality, the length and the breadth of the services that people who depend on a universal service obligation enjoy or do not enjoy are not in themselves functions of ownership. That is the point that needs to be established. I say that without any fear of contradiction. As somebody from rural and regional Australia who knows that the time at which there was the greatest disparity between the sort of services that my city cousins enjoyed and that I experienced was when we had a wholly owned PMG and an ALP in power which did not have in place a customer service guarantee at all, which had a USO that was not worth the paper it was written on and which had no interest or willpower to pursue either. By contrast, the simple reality is that - and I trust that this will be reflected in the New England media as well - as the Prime Minister clearly indicated yesterday, when a government has a commitment to rural and regional Australia and the willpower to put in place an effective USO and a customer service guarantee and to pursue them and to make them work, you will get the services you need. Let's lift this above the childish level of intellectual input provided by the member opposite and get to some realities here. Services are the key to decentralisation in rural and regional Australia; they are what matter. No-one is more committed to getting regional telecommunication services up to scratch and keeping them there than I am, but the longer we pretend this myopic view that ownership is the key to services in country Australia, the longer we will be engaging in a debate that is nothing more than a hoodwink.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest who, like all members on this side of the House, has a deep and abiding concern about protecting the clean and green image of our nation and ensuring that we maintain an effective border against the entry of pests and diseases into this country. That is why this government was prepared to commit $600 million towards upgrading our quarantine and border services so that we now have the most effective screening mechanism that our nation has ever known. That has certainly made a major impact in securing the safety of our nation and in avoiding the risk of pests and diseases coming into this country.  The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK provided a very graphic example of the potential impact to a country when a major disease outbreak occurs. Foot-and-mouth disease cost the British economy around £12 billion. ABARE has estimated that, if a similar outbreak were to occur in Australia, we would lose export revenues of $9 billion over a period of 12 months. The estimate of the effect on our economy, provided in a recent Productivity Commission report, suggests that the impact on our economy could be as much as $13 billion. That impact would clearly be devastating for our nation, so it is important that we maintain a high standard of preparedness and a capacity to deal with any outbreak, should it occur.The Council of Australian Governments has also taken this matter seriously and charged agriculture ministers around Australia with putting together a strategy to deal with these sorts of issues. It has been suggested that not only do we need this strategy; we also need to test it to make sure that it will work. So, from 9 to 12 September, a major exercise called Exercise Minotaur will be held to test Australia's responsiveness to a major pest and disease outbreak. This exercise will involve all levels of government - around 1,000 people - and it will endeavour to establish how effectively we are able to respond to a major outbreak of the nature of that which occurred in the UK. I want to stress that this is an exercise. We are going to great lengths to advise people around the world, in our embassies in other countries, that there will not be a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Australia between 9 and 12 September - it is just an exercise. There will also be extensive briefings of the community so that there can be no unnecessary concerns in that regard. It will be a very significant exercise. Nearly 100 countries have asked to be observers, and there will be a team of international people to look at what we are doing and to help provide some critical analysis of our capacity to deal with these issues. This is a clear demonstration that not only have we been prepared to put in place a program to effectively deal with an outbreak of this nature but we are prepared to examine it in a very open and professional way so that, should we have the horror of our improved border defences being breached in some way, we also have a capacity to effectively address the concerns within our country. This exercise is important for our nation and, in alerting people to it today, I want to emphasise again that it is an exercise. We do not anticipate that there will be an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in this country but, should it happen, we will be ready to address any issues which arise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and for her interest in higher education. On 26 April this year I launched the first of what is a series of seven discussion papers to inform the review of Australian higher education. In addition to that, I established a specialised unit within my department and brought in some people from outside to actually look at the issues facing Australian higher education. I also established a reference group to advise me through this process with a view to putting Australian higher education on a sounder footing for the 21st century. The reason I am a little bit surprised to receive this question is that in four months, 35 media releases and 12,180 words there has not been one single positive contribution toward Australian higher education reform from the Australian Labor Party.At the moment, as has been pointed out by a number of informed contributors to Australian higher education and participants in it, the issues that face Australian universities are not just about funding. The issues that face Australian universities are about the definitional roles of our 38 universities in modern Australia. To what extent should research, teaching and scholarship define a university? Why do we have 40 per cent attrition rates, where do we have them and how can we prevent them? We also need to understand how we can recognise and fund the quite complex, onerous and increasingly expensive community service obligations faced by regional universities. How can we get better commercialisation of intellectual property? Royalties, trademarks and licences represent only 0.16 per cent of university revenue. - In relation to students, 10 years ago, in 1992, there were 100,000 Australians eligible for university entry who were not able to gain a place under the Labor government. The unmet demand this year was between 10,500 and 17,500. That means that unmet demand is the lowest that it has been for a decade. On the issue of fees - I am glad the member for Jagajaga asked - the Australian taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of university education in this country. The student - him or herself - pays for about one quarter.  - The money is lent by the Australian taxpayer to that student. - The student does not pay off any of the fee or any of the loan until they graduate. There are 1,115,317 Australians who owe money to the Australian taxpayer for their education. Of those, 91 per cent owe less than $16,000 - that is a Mitsubishi three-door Mirage, drive away no more to pay. The average HECS debt is $7,800. That means that more than 700,000 Australians owe less than it would cost to go into the Preston Harvey Norman and buy a top-of-the-range flat screen television set. I also draw the honourable member's attention to an article in the Australian Financial Review on 15 March this year. The article states:Australia is still top of the list for its 130,000 international students at tertiary institutions when it comes to the affordability of courses and living expenses....					...					...A report by the universities' marketing development arm, IDP Education Australia, and Australian Education International, compared the cost ...with that of other countries - In the US, an undergraduate degree and living costs will be two to three times more expensive for an international student, while the UK costs up to 66 per cent more. Canada, while cheaper than either, was still up to 30 per cent more expensive.It also ought to be pointed out that the Youth Allowance is indexed to the consumer price index. The Youth Allowance introduced by this government also extended rent assistance to students for the first time.One of the points that also ought to be made is that it is the everyday men and women in this country, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university, whose taxes and hard work - while they are trying to feed their children and pay off their car loans and mortgages - are underwriting three-quarters of the cost of university education in this country. The average male university graduate earns $612,000 more over a lifetime than someone who does not go to university and a female graduate earns more than $400,000. As far as I am concerned, university education is a pretty good deal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his contribution to this debate. He follows a very rich line of very good members from Flinders over the years. According to a recent accountants survey, two-thirds of Australia's small businesses see a lack of insurance cover as their biggest business risk. We, on this side of the House, support the view of small business and the community that people should take responsibility for their own actions. That is why we have put in place tax changes on structured settlements and amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which are being debated at the moment. Overwhelming responsibility for tort law reform rests with the states.I can advise the House that, as a result of national reforms, Suncorp GIO has announced that it is going back into the business of comprehensive public liability insurance.  - It is good news. All small businesses, tourism operators and community groups will welcome this announcement. Suncorp Group Executive, John Trowbridge - a pretty good guy and well respected - said:The reforms will lead to a reduction in costs in the public liability system, and this gives us an opportunity to make public liability insurance available at reasonable prices to more consumers.Consumers will welcome this announcement - all consumers except for five million Victorians, who are going to miss out. That is because Suncorp is not going to offer these new products and services to Victorians, because Victoria is the only state in Australia that has done nothing on public liability reform. The Chief Executive of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce said: The Victorian government has avoided introducing reforms to civil liability payouts and as a consequence Victorian business will suffer. Suncorp has confirmed it will not be making public liability policies available in Victoria for a range of industries.So what is Mr Bracks going to say to the Ace-Hi Ranch at Cape Schank in the electorate of Flinders? What is Mr Bracks going to say to the Hard Rock Climbing Co. in the electorate of Deakin? What is he going to say to the Ozone Hotel, in the electorate of Corangamite, when they have to pay insurance premiums far higher than those paid by anyone in New South Wales, South Australia or other parts of Australia? It may have something to do with the close working relationship between Rob Hulls, the Labor Attorney-General in Victoria, and the Plaintiff Lawyers Association.  - Oh! - More to come there! That is a rainy day issue, that one! Or it could have something to do with the fact that Victoria has the highest state taxes on insurance of any jurisdiction in the whole world. So why would Steve Bracks want to introduce competition into the Victorian insurance market and reduce premiums when, for every dollar in premium that is charged, Steve Bracks receives nearly 40c in taxes? Or it might just have something to do with the fact that Steve Bracks leads a government that does nothing and, like all the rest of the Labor Party, cares nothing for small business. </DOC>

 - I thought you were supposed to be surprised by questions from the opposition. As I said in answer to an earlier question, we have been conducting a review, and there are difficult challenges facing Australian higher education, prospective students and their families, and there are choices that we have to make as a nation. There are decisions that have to made as a nation which rise above the day-to-day political debate that comes from the Labor Party. The Labor Party is yet to make any kind of meaningful contribution to Australian higher education reform.In relation to students and graduates, the first thing that ought to be pointed out is that the Australian Graduate Starting Salaries report was released last week, and it found that the average bachelor's degree university graduate now earns, in his or her first year after graduation, $35,000 - which is an increase of $2,000 on last year. That is 86 per cent of the average Australian earnings. That means, even if you go down towards the bottom of the list, to the 23rd occupation, that almost every university graduate earns more in his or her first year after graduation than their entire HECS debt. I was tuned into MIX 94.5 a few days ago -  -  - As you certainly would, because there are a lot hardworking taxpayers out there who are supporting university education. I heard the well-known commentator and financial adviser, Mr Paul Clitheroe say:If you are looking for an asset worth investing in, take a look in the mirror. It is easy to forget that when it comes to increasing your wealth, the best asset you have is your own ability to earn a good income. That is why spending some time and money taking on additional training and education can be one of the best investments that you will ever make.He went on to say:Research has shown that, over the course of a lifetime, a university graduate will earn almost 60 per cent more than a school leaver. And that is despite graduates starting work later and having a HECS bill to pay off. Another thing that needs to be pointed out is that the level of debt undertaken by students is not increased to that extent, but the number of students in Australian universities has increased and the amount of money that Australian taxpayers are lending to those students has increased; it is now $8.2 billion, as of the end of June this year. The loan is indexed in relation to the consumer price index, there is a discount for up-front payment, there is a discount for part-payments, and there is a remission and write-down rate.As far as the policy of the Australian Labor Party is concerned, we know three things: the first is that the member for Jagajaga was reported in the Australian on 6 March as saying that she saw unmet demand - qualified students who do not get a place - as a `shocking waste'. She thought at the time that the number was 52,500, and she thought that was a shocking waste. The minimum cost of funding that from the public purse would be $640 million. - The next thing the Labor Party said it wanted to do was to increase from $23,242 a year to $25,000 the income threshold at which students start paying back the money - a minimum cost of $266 million over four years. She has also said that no Australian student should be offered the same opportunities as students from Beijing or Jakarta, who can take up a full fee-paying place in an Australian university once the public ones are filled. That would cost a minimum of $70 million a year. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question, which is quite relevant given the current debate. Australia's exports of services and manufactured goods have risen by more than 50 per cent over the course of this government's time in office, from $99 billion in 1996 to $154 billion last year, generating one in five jobs across Australia and - importantly for the interests of the member for Herbert - one in four jobs in regional Australia.As a component of that, services exports achieved a level of $31 billion last year. That was an increase from $24 billion in 1996. Obviously the tourism industry is the largest contributor to that sector, achieving $17 billion last year compared with $14.6 billion in 1996. Interestingly, education is the fastest growing services export and is now worth more than $4 billion a year. In 1996, it earned only $2.8 billion. There are now 188,000 overseas students enrolled in Australian education and training. That has grown by 66,000 students since 1995. Those students are studying at Australian institutions both onshore and offshore. This sector is absolutely focused on growing its export earnings for the Australian economy. For the benefit of the member for Herbert, in the marine biology and aquaculture program at the James Cook University, which is in his electorate, almost 35 per cent of the students are overseas students. In the electorate of the member for Cunningham, who is not here at this stage - we expect there will be a new member for Cunningham in the not too distant future - 4,400 students out of 15,000 students at the University of Wollongong are international students and come from more than 70 countries. Most importantly, the University of New South Wales has been a consistent performer as far as export earnings are concerned. It is a member of the Exporter Hall of Fame. It is ranked in the top 10 universities in the Asian region. The University of New South Wales has achieved that four years in a row. It has 8,200 international students.In a press release that was published when they won that award, there was an indication of the level of standing of the University of New South Wales internationally. After winning the IDP Education Australia education award at the 2000 Australian export awards, the University of New South Wales is building a reputation globally for attracting top quality international students ahead of prestigious education institutions like Oxford, Harvard and Yale universities. It is proof positive that our services sector is making its contribution to the export growth and the wellbeing of our economy. In particular, the education sector in Australia is creating a significant standing internationally and earning much needed export dollars for Australia. Those who participate in managing the tertiary education sector, particularly in an export sense, absolutely support the policies and the perspective of the government in developing that education base in Australia, so they can achieve the export earnings we want to see them achieve in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is an overwhelming majority of doctors who continue to accept the repatriation gold card for veteran patients. This is yet another easy scare campaign from the Labor Party, which is more interested in scoring very cheap political points than honestly representing the interests of the veteran community. Many in the veteran community happen to be some of our more senior Australians.  - For the benefit of all members here who are interested in this important matter, I would like to read some of the correspondence from and media reporting of prominent members of the ex-service community. Firstly, I will read part of a letter from the much respected June Healey, who is the President of the War Widows Guild of Australia. Mrs Healey has written to me, saying:Mark Bishop's media release [on the extent of specialists refusing to treat veterans on the gold card] tends to inflame the situation. - Secondly, I quote from Mr John Ryan, who is the President of the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Servicemen and Women Limited and a fearless advocate for veterans rights. He was reported in the West Australian newspaper as saying the problem was not serious. Mr Brian McKenzie, National President of the highly regarded Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, in response to a question on the seriousness of the problem, said to ABC Hobart:I haven't had any reports. There have been some isolated cases, Australia-wide. I've got tabs on things nationally, but I do not think it is as big as what it is being made out to be.These are just some of the examples of veteran representatives exposing the exaggerated claims of Senator Bishop and the Labor Party and the unnecessary fear being spread in the veteran community by Labor's insensitive and irresponsible opportunism.The government is aware that some medical specialists are unhappy with the level of fees for services to the veteran community. My department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is currently discussing the matter with the Australian Medical Association. During these discussions, it would not be prudent of me to comment further. However, the government will not be blackmailed by Labor's unscrupulous and irresponsible tactics on this matter.  -  - I say this quietly -  - Labor should be supporting the veterans -  - Labor should be supporting the veterans not the doctors in these discussions. As Dr Tim Woodruff, President of the Doctors Reform Society, said in the Sunday Times:It is not appropriate to use the withdrawal of services as the bargaining chip to increase remuneration to specialists.The majority of GPs and specialists in Australia continue to honour the gold card, and our discussions with the AMA will continue. In the meantime, if any veteran is having any difficulty at all in being treated by a specialist, please contact my department because they will arrange an alternative.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can say that no, I am not personally aware of any such letter. I will make inquiries of my department. I understand that he said it was sent today, if that is correct -  - Yesterday. But I can say that, as I answered yesterday, the overwhelming majority of doctors, including specialists, are continuing to honour the gold card for veteran patients. This is an important matter and deserves more than the scare tactics that are being perpetrated. The average age of our war veterans is in the late 70s, and the provision of universal health care is one of the most meaningful ways that we can acknowledge their service and their sacrifice.As I said yesterday, the Department of Veterans' Affairs is currently discussing this matter with the Australian Medical Association. In fact, I met this morning with Dr Kerryn Phelps and other representatives from the AMA. I believe it was a very good meeting and I have every reason to believe that the excellent relationship that has been enjoyed between my department and the AMA will continue. But let me make it clear that the Australian community and the government do not accept that the threat to withdraw services to veterans is a legitimate means to progress discussions on the future treatment of veterans. I restate: the majority of GPs and specialists continue to honour our gold card, and after our discussions with the AMA I believe that they will continue to do so. In the meantime, if a veteran is having difficulty locating any treating specialist I invite them to contact my department.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth, who I know has a very keen personal interest in the progress of the newly independent nation of East Timor. It is true that tomorrow is the third anniversary of the historic vote by the people of that now tiny nation for self-determination. On behalf of the government - and, I am sure, on behalf of all honourable members - I want to remark what an important event that was, and also what a very significant role Australia played in the events leading up to the vote, subsequently through the deployment of the INTERFET force and continuing until today, when, under the flag of the United Nations, Australia continues to contribute some hundreds of ADF personnel.It is well known that the representations that were made by the Australian government - and, not least, my own letter to President Habibie - led to a significant change in the policy of the then Indonesian government. It turned around a quarter of a century of Australian policy - from both sides of the parliament, I might add - and led to very significant change and an outcome that gave to this country the opportunity to act on behalf of a small nation that, on proper grounds, regarded itself as being very unfairly treated. The leadership and the contribution that Australia made to those events is very widely respected around the world. There are very few people, even in this country, who take the view that the actions of the Australian government at that time were other than totally in our national interest and in the interests of the principles on which this nation is built.Many of us had the opportunity of going to Dili for the independence celebrations. As a measure of the way in which Indonesia has moved on, as have the East Timorese, undoubtedly the highlight of those celebrations was the arrival of President Megawati of Indonesia. Her gracious act of reconciliation towards the people of East Timor and the warmth of the reception that she received were by far the most impressive highlights of that occasion for me. I take the opportunity of congratulating President Megawati on the forward view that she has taken in relation to the links between her country and East Timor.It was our honour to host a visit by President Xanana Gusmao in June of this year. East Timor, a tiny country with many challenges, is well served by the quality of its leadership, and I know that all members of this House would want me to convey the message of congratulations to which the honourable member for Wentworth so properly referred.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. All members of the House know what a great interest the member for Fadden has in foreign affairs and in particular in consular issues to do with the safety and welfare of Australians overseas. In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question, Australians travelling overseas must always remember that they are not subject to the laws of Australia, in the main; they are subject to the laws of the country they are in. This point is reinforced in the travel advisories and consular publications from my department and also in a booklet which is issued with every Australian passport. Our advice underlines that the death sentence is a potential penalty for drug trafficking in some countries. This government is very concerned about drug trafficking and works hard to promote regional cooperation to combat this crime, through our diplomatic as well as police, immigration and Customs networks, and through our aid program. Having said that, this government and previous Australian governments going back quite some years now have always had a strong and consistent position against the death penalty as punishment for these and any other offences.I was concerned to hear that yesterday, 28 August, the death penalty was imposed in Ho Chi Minh City on an Australian citizen, Ms Le My Linh, following her conviction for transporting heroin. Ms Linh did not contest the charge. She was found carrying 880 grams of heroin at Ho Chi Minh City airport and was on her way to Sydney. There is no doubt that, as a matter of principle, we appreciate the efforts of the Vietnamese authorities to catch drug traffickers and to ensure, quite apart from anything else, that heroin cannot be transported to Sydney - the city to which this woman was travelling - or to any other part of Australia. To that extent, we are grateful to the Vietnamese authorities for the interception. We are grateful to the Vietnamese authorities for the vigour with which they approach the issue of drug trafficking. But the government has made its opposition to the death penalty very clear to the Vietnamese authorities over some weeks now, both in Australia and in Vietnam. I underlined this position myself yesterday, in a letter I wrote to the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, and foreshadowed that, should the sentence be confirmed on appeal - the conviction is not being appealed, but I understand the sentence is - the government will support a request for the sentence to be commuted. I have also spoken today with the Vietnamese Ambassador to Australia and have essentially made the same points to him, more or less, that I am making here in answer to the honourable member's question.Officers from my department and the Consulate-General in Ho Chi Minh City have been providing consular support to Ms Linh and her family since she was arrested some time ago, on 17 November last year. Three consular access visits have been granted. We have ensured that she has legal representation, we have secured visits for her children - I understand she has two children - and we have monitored her welfare. The government do not want to give the impression to the Vietnamese government that we are sympathetic to drug traffickers. We do not want to express anything but gratitude to the Vietnamese government for its determination to fight the drug trade, but we do want to leave a clear message for the Vietnamese government that this government - and, I should say, almost all members of this parliament too - oppose the death penalty. We hope that, subject to what happens in the appeal process, Ms Linh's death sentence will be commuted to a custodial sentence.</DOC>

 - As Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training, and having the privilege to have that position in the first government elected for Australia for the 21st century, there are a number of things that I always try to say to young people on behalf of not only the government but their parents: young people only have one life; they only have one opportunity to use their lives to find and achieve their own potential. Education is not just about preparing young people for the future, it is about giving them the confidence to believe that they can create the kind of future that they really want. Education is not just about the transfer of knowledge and skills, it is about building a sense of values and producing adults of character. One of the most important things I have found in my life - I have said this on a number of occasions and I will repeat it here in the House - is that I have made many mistakes, and I will make many more. If I did not, I would not be human. One of the key things that is important to finding success in your life is to keep an open mind. You always need to listen to what other people are saying. In front of my desk in my ministerial office, to remind me of what is important in education and in life, is a photograph which is probably the size-and-a-half of standard sized door. It is a black-and-white photograph of a man who is now dead: Neville Bonner. It is not there because Bonner was the first Aborigine elected to the federal parliament; it is there to remind me on a day-to-day basis of what is important in education. Bonner was born on Ukerebagh Island under a palm tree. His father left him when he was an infant; his mother died when he was a child. His grandparents, who raised him, tried to send him to a school near Lismore. He was excluded from that school because non-Indigenous parents did not like seeing an Aboriginal boy at that school. He finally had one single year of education; he did three years in one year at Beaudesert School. His grandmother said to him, `Neville, if you learn to read and write, express yourself well and treat other human beings with courtesy and respect, it will take you a long way.' That photograph stands there every single day to remind me that what is important in education is that it is able to lift people against the most difficult adversity that many people on the other side of this place cannot even begin to imagine. In the end -  -  - It is interesting that there is a national leadership forum here today and young people have come from all over Australia to have a look at what leadership might be about. All of us need to understand that in life the most important thing is to keep an open mind and listen to another person's point of view. Because in keeping an open mind, in doing what Robert Menzies said in 1944, which was that to every good citizen the state owes not only a chance in life but a self-respecting life, the fundamental is education. Every day that I have the privilege to be in this job I will support and annunciate to Australian children and their families that education is based on values. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and for his interest in the Australian economy. The ABS today released its survey of new capital expenditure, or CAPEX, for the June quarter, which showed that capital spending on buildings and structures increased by 5.4 per cent in June and spending on equipment and machinery increased by 5.7 per cent. In addition, CAPEX also has a survey of intentions for the forthcoming year. Businesses reported that they expect to spend $41.6 billion on new buildings and capital equipment in the 2002-03 financial year, an estimate 8.8 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate for 2001-02. This is a very strong expectation of capital investment in the forthcoming year and is consistent with the government's budget forecasts that business investment will be strong and take up some of the slack from the housing cycle. There are a number of big new investments taking place in Australia at the moment: the North West Shelf fourth train, the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, the Grocon Queen Victoria redevelopment site in Melbourne, the Duke Energy Bass Strait pipeline, the Kwinana gas plant in Western Australia, Comalco's development in Queensland and the AMC magnesium project. New capital construction is to come on line, like the Scoresby Freeway, which we expect next year, the Craigieburn bypass and the Geelong road. - I am just looking under G for the Gladesville roundabout. There it is there, is it? There is a bit of special pleading going on about Gladesville. - I am being interrupted on my right, Mr Speaker. This is a good thing for investment in Australia and a stronger economy. It is coming at a time when the housing cycle is expected to come off. The July trade balance was an improvement on June, with a narrowing of the deficit to $643 million from $998 million in the previous month. Exports were $328 million higher in July, mainly reflecting exports in non-rural goods. As I said yesterday, we would expect the drought to kick in and affect rural exports, unfortunately, during the later part of this year.Next week the APEC finance ministers will be meeting in Mexico. I will be representing Australia at that meeting. This is the first opportunity to discuss global events in the wake of some of the fallout in US stock markets and the volatility in Brazil and Argentina in relation to currency and their economies. The world situation continues to be of concern to the Australian government, but business investment intentions are strong. That is good news for Australian job seekers.</DOC>

 - In an earlier question that was ruled out of order, there was a reference to my medical training. It is interesting that one of the standouts in my life - in my journey to getting here - is a fellow called Rick Burns, a Professor of Neurology at Flinders University.  - Professor Burns is striking for many reasons. One of the most outstanding features of this man is that, when I was a fifth-year medical student, he came to speak to us and he spent an hour telling us about the mistakes he had made in his medical life. It is interesting, in the current medico-legal climate, to imagine whether he would do that now. I thought, `Why would someone so esteemed spend an hour telling us about the mistakes he had made?' I have learned, as I have gone through my life, that we all make mistakes. - The most important thing is that we are prepared to face up to them and to discuss them. I am very fortunate, I learned four values from the Jesuits, with whom I spent the last two years of my education. These are examples of the kinds of values that we are trying to encourage and support in government and non-government schools. These are the four values. Firstly, if you want to succeed, you need to be committed. You need to persistently apply yourself to the things in which you believe, which is why the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister today. Secondly, you need to always have a sense of conscience about everything you do, which is typified by the debate in the parliament. You need to ask yourself all of the time, `What is the right thing to do?' Thirdly, you need a sense of compassion. You need to always ask yourself, `How would I feel if this were ever to happen to me?' Fourthly, you need courage. You need a brave heart.I should conclude because I realise the hardworking taxpayers of this country, who are trying to feed their kids and to pay their car loans and their mortgages, would like us to talk about policy. The last comment I would make is that, about a week before the 1996 election, I received a phone call from a person very close to my father who had supported the labour movement all his life. He said to me, `I'm going to vote for the Liberals next week.' I asked, `Why is that?' He said, `Because Keating and Brereton and those people do not represent everything I ever believed in.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. It is a very important question about something that impacts upon us all as members of parliament. It is a matter of very considerable interest to many of our constituents. The past year has been a very difficult one for tourism around the world, particularly following the events of September 11. But it is clear that, over the longer term, Australia has been experiencing very strong growth in tourism, and there are indications that we will remain a very popular destination. In the past financial year, we saw more than 3.3 million people arrive in Australia on visitor visas. That is an increase of 1.5 million in the last decade. We are not far off having doubled our outcome in that time.The good news is that, for visitor visas issued to people from countries we have traditionally seen as being of higher immigration risk and from some of the emerging tourism markets, the rates have been exceptionally good. Approval rates are up, so that almost 98 per cent of applications are now the subject of a visa grant. That has enabled us to respond to growth, particularly in China and India, amongst other markets. What pleases me is that the non-return rates are at an all-time low. The level is now 1.85 per cent. This is the first time it has ever been below two per cent. That is good news for Australia, and it is good news for those people from Australia who are interested in having family visitors from overseas. But it is not a matter that we should take for granted. It is something that we have to continue working on. Yesterday, I launched a new initiative which is the Family Visitor Network. I recommend that those members of parliament who were not present at the launch - there were a number present - see the material and be aware that family visitors through that network will now have departmental officers here in Australia who can assist them in obtaining advice on those matters. It will help them to understand the framework of law; it will not mean that people who we think are high risk will be able to get access. But it will help them to understand the process. From time to time, some people have suggested that the government are solely focused on boat arrivals and unauthorised arrivals and that we are not serious about breaches of immigration laws by visitors and other visa holders. I want to say that nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is we have seen strong growth in our activities to ensure that people not abiding by visa conditions are located and removed from Australia wherever possible. I wish to let you know that in the last year my department located 17,307 people who had overstayed visas or were found breaching visa conditions, for example by working when they had no lawful authority to do so. That contrasts with the situation in 1994-95, the second last year of the former government, when only 9,018 overstayers were located. Unfortunately, at that time the numbers were trending down. In the last year of the former government only 7,800 overstayers were located, so we have looked at considerably more than that. Almost 2½ times that number of people have been located as a result of compliance activities. I want to make this point very strongly: we can continue to see growth in visitors to Australia, and particularly family visitors, if we have compliant visits. It is important that the people who are making those linkages advise their families and friends that they are helping others if they are able to ensure that those who come to Australia undertake bona fide visits so we can maintain the integrity of the system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question and for it having, in particular, a policy focus. While I disagree with him on policy, he is one of the members on the other side for whom I have a high personal regard. The question is in relation to university students and how often they are working and so on. The information that I have available to me - and I would be very happy for the member for Port Adelaide to provide the evidence which he cited in his question, and I will check its veracity - is that the average university student is required to work to support their living expenses on average about 4½ or 5 hours a week. As many of us who have had the privilege of having a university education would know, that is not necessarily a new experience. I think most of us have done that, including me. I had two part-time jobs when I was at university. In fact, not only do students themselves but I think, increasingly, parents also see that as a very important part of life experience. As the Foreign Minister was just reminding me, I spent some very enjoyable time working in the basement of Harris Scarfe selling soft furnishings.  There is an important thing here that needs to be understood. It is interesting to be actually out in the field working and meeting every single day with everyday Australians. I will relate to the House a story. I was standing outside the Queensland University of Technology. I was waiting to go inside the QUT, and there was a woman next to me - an everyday kind of person. I said to her, `It's a funny thing to ask, but what do you think about universities?' She stepped back a bit and said, `I don't know, really. I applied to go to one once but I didn't get in.' She said, `Are you going inside there?' and I said yes. She said, `Could you tell them something for me?' and I said yes. She said, `You tell them I work really hard and my taxes pay for what goes on in there.' She then said, `You tell them that, when they come out and apply for the same job I apply for, they'll get the job.'  - Sometimes honourable members on the other side do not know what they do not know so you have to run through a bit of information. What is important is that Australian taxpayers pay for about three-quarters of the cost of the education of a student who goes to university, and that was a policy that was introduced in 1988 by the Australian Labor Party, supported quite sensibly by the members on this side. What is also worth remembering, and I will run through these figures, is that the Australian taxpayer actually lends the money for the cost of one-quarter of that education to the students who then derive a benefit from that education.In fact, the average male graduate earns $622,000 more over a lifetime and the average female graduate $412,000 more over a lifetime than someone who did not go to university. The average HECS debt is $7,800, and 91 per cent owe less than $16,000. Do you know, Mr Speaker, there are 64 people in the country who owe more than $40,000 to the Australian taxpayer - the mechanics, the tilers, the bricklayers, the retail salesmen and the other hard working men and women of this country who those on the other side purport to represent. They are actually paying for three-quarters of it. - In concluding, in his or her first year after graduation, a university bachelor graduate earns, in almost every case, more than the total cost of their contribution to their education.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I acknowledge his interest in and support of the charitable sector. In September 2000, the government announced an inquiry into charities, headed by the honourable Ian Sheppard. The report was released last year, and today I am announcing the government's response to that report. At present, the definition of a charity is set under approximately 400 years of case law, dating back to the Statute of Elizabeth. The government has decided to enact in its place a legislative definition of `charity' for the purpose of the administration of Commonwealth laws and to adopt the majority of the inquiry's recommendations for the definition. The legislative definition will provide greater clarity and transparency for charities. It will explicitly allow not-for-profit child care available to the public, self-help bodies that have open and non-discriminatory membership and closed or contemplative religious orders the opportunity to be charities. So it will extend the definition in those respects. It will provide certainty to those organisations operating in the sector while providing the flexibility required to ensure the definition can adapt to the changing needs of society. In addition, the government has decided that, from 1 July 2004, charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities will be required to be endorsed by the Australian Taxation Office in order to access all relevant tax concessions. These organisations will have their status attached to their Australian business number, and the public will be able to have a complete list of those which have that status through the Australian Business Register.I think all of us would recognise the wonderful work that is done by charities in our community. As a consequence, charities enjoy special tax status - exemption from income tax, some of them have gift deductibility, special rules in relation to fringe benefits tax and special rules relating to GST. The government will be preserving those concessions, but it will be giving additional certainty to this area so that not only charities but also those that deal with them will know the particular tax status that they have. I will be asking the Board of Taxation to discuss the fine detail of the legislation and report back to the government. I want to again thank Justice Sheppard and his committee for the wonderful work that they did. This will be a great improvement in a very important area for a very important sector that contributes a lot to the life of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Bulk-billing is something which this government has been committed to. In fact, a substantial number of Australians make use of bulk-billing services every day when they visit their general practitioners. Some 73 per cent of services provided by general practitioners are bulk-billed, and for people over the age of 65 I understand that more than 80 per cent of services are bulk-billed. So bulk-billing is something to which this government is committed, just like Medicare and just like the rest of the provision of health services to the Australian people. As to the specific detail in the latter part of the member's question, I will take it on notice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. To put her mind at rest, let me assure all members that this government is totally opposed to compulsory union membership. We are totally opposed to compulsory union levies because we believe that this is a way of bringing back the closed shop by the back door, and that is the last thing that Australian workers need right now. That said, it would be only fair of me to acknowledge the historic role that unions have played at different times, civilising capitalism and establishing the dignity of work. But unions have had enormous difficulty making the adjustment from an era which was focused on the collective to the modern time, which focuses more on the individual. Unions have had difficulties adjusting to the great cultural shift from the tribal to the personal which has taken place over the last few decades. As members would probably know, union membership as a proportion of the population has gone down from over a half to under a quarter. What members opposite and the unions need to understand is that you cannot cure by compulsion what you have not been able to achieve by persuasion. That is the fundamental point. I think that the best minds opposite appreciate this fundamental point. For instance, Premier Carr has said:You can't put a tax on other members of the work force and the state can't require the collection of union fees from non-unionists.Premier Gallop of Western Australia is on the record attacking a $400 fee for non-union nurses. The member for Barton, the shadow minister, has said:Before I felt comfortable with that concept - that is, the concept of compulsory union fees - I would want to know why unions are unable to recruit members in a particular area.That is what the best thinkers and the good hearts of the ALP think. Unfortunately, that is not the attitude that senators from the ALP adopted in the Senate last night. They returned to form and they adopted a knee-jerk, pro-union position. I should let all members know that the government is totally committed to its legislation in this area. It will be re-presented in three months time. I think that will give members opposite a chance to reconsider their views.Let me say in conclusion, and I might say this particularly to the Leader of the Opposition: it is not enough to talk about reducing union power unless you actually do something to demonstrate that it has been reduced. When this bill comes back into the House and then into the Senate in three months time, it will be a very good opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to show that he has changed, to show that Labor has changed, by supporting this important piece of legislation.</DOC>

 - Obviously I am quite concerned to hear the member for Barton make the claim in this House that an Australian workplace agreement has disadvantaged people in this way and stripped people of conditions in this way. But let me simply remind all members of this House that it is impossible for an Australian workplace agreement to be registered unless it passes something called the no-disadvantage test. If the AWA in question has passed the no-disadvantage test, the member for Barton's question is simply factually inaccurate. If it has not passed the test, obviously it can go back to be reconsidered by the appropriate authorities. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell, a longstanding advocate for small business. As the member for Mitchell knows, a healthy economy, based on sound economic management, has helped to create new small businesses. In the first 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system, 47,000 new small businesses started in Australia. Isn't that fantastic! Less tax, low inflation and a growing economy deliver better capital expenditure and create jobs. All this has been brought about by the hard work of small business and this government's reforms - all of which were opposed by the Labor Party. It is also obvious that the Labor Party, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said a little earlier, is determined to stop in the Senate our further reform in favour of small business.Obviously the composition of the Senate affects the passage of small business legislation. I previously advised the House that the recently retired former senator Barney Cooney was the last Labor senator to have ever worked in a small business. I hope I have not inadvertently misled the House - I may have been a little unfair to Labor's new Queensland senator, Senator Claire Moore. Senator Moore was state secretary of the CPSU from 1994 until 2001. However, I overlooked her job as a director of a public company, the SEARCH Foundation. Senator Moore was a director until just two weeks before she entered parliament as a new Labor senator on 1 July.Of course, this does not happen to be in her official CV. I asked myself: why would Senator Moore hide her small business credentials by not putting them on her CV? So I did a little research on the Search Foundation. I checked the web site and found some very interesting links. Listed from the top are the Australian Greens; the Australian Labor Party; the Center for Democratic Values, which is a US socialist group; the Democratic Left, which is a British political organisation that emerged out of the Communist Party of Great Britain -  - The SEARCH Foundation has two other political party links: the New Patriotic Movement of the Philippines, and the South African Communist Party. This is the private sector small business that the Labor senator was a director of two weeks before she entered parliament. I went on to check what the SEARCH Foundation does. I found the answer in a book titled The Reds: the Communist Party of Australia from origins to illegality. `Hello!' I said. In the comprehensive text of the history of the Communist Party, the acknowledgment of the author goes like this -  - Mr Speaker, I was looking at the history of this small business, the SEARCH Foundation. In this comprehensive book, it says: This work began in response to an invitation from the SEARCH Foundation, the successor of the Communist Party and the custodian of its records.So Senator Moore came into this place as a Labor senator and, two weeks before, she was a director of the successor to the Communist Party of Australia. Mr Speaker, it gets better. As you would ask of any good small business, how does the SEARCH Foundation fund itself? That is a very good question. There is more to come on that. - This is a private sector assistance organisation. It is assisting the Labor Party because the directors of it are going into parliament. But the interesting issue is where the money goes. Political returns from this small business indicate that the only party it financially supports is the Australian Greens. - Not only does the SEARCH Foundation fund the Australian Greens, who voted against our small business package just a few weeks ago in the Senate, and not only does the SEARCH Foundation have a Labor senator who, two weeks beforehand, was a director of the foundation - which is a successor to the Communist Party of Australia - but also the former member for Ryan Leonie Short is now on the board of the SEARCH Foundation. Now we discover that not only is the SEARCH Foundation funding the Australian Greens but also it is closely linked to the Australian Labor Party. There are serious questions to be answered by the Labor Party on its links with the successor to the Australian Communist Party. They need to answer where the $2.8 million comes from. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I would not deny for a second that there are quite a large number of Australians who feel under a great deal of pressure. Obviously there are some Australians who are working very long hours and some working long hours who are not making enormous amounts of money. I would certainly accept that. But what I would also say is that the problem is getting, if anything, slightly better rather than worse. Although I do not have these statistics at my fingertips, I am fairly confident that the ABS statistics show that the percentage of workers working unpaid overtime in Australia has dropped, rather than increased, over the last five years. Certainly, if you look at the figures from the mid-eighties to the current period, the big increase in standard full-time hours took place between 1985 and 1995. If anything, they have gone backwards slightly since then. In fact - and I think I am quoting accurately, from memory full-time workers averaged 39 hours a week in 1985; in 1995, they averaged 41 hours a week; now, they still average 41 hours a week. Sure, it is an issue. It is a problem, but it is a problem which is not getting worse. It is a problem which, if anything, is getting better under this government. The other point that I should make is that hours are quite properly a matter to be regulated by awards and agreements. That has traditionally been the case and it should remain the case. </DOC>

 - Previously, on 12 July, I informed the House of the efforts I was making to improve rural banking services in conjunction with the Rural Transaction Centre program. I am pleased to advise the House today that my efforts have had some success already, because they were directed especially to convincing the banking industry to participate in the Rural Transaction Centre program by, for instance, donating the bank premises they were proposing to close to rural transaction centre community groups and by forming community partnerships so that their banking service was in fact maintained in that community. I wish to advise the House that these efforts have already shown some success and that a number of properties owned by banks, either closed or proposed to be closed, have been offered to communities, particularly in the state of Victoria and in the electorate of Murray.Another small community have now advised me that they have concluded negotiations with the National Australia Bank to provide post office, telecentre, banking and government services - both state and federal - from the bank building in their town where the bank involved was considering closure and where the banking services were limited to approximately six hours per week in two three-hour periods. Furthermore, the bank proposes to continue to provide direct officer services, ranging from management to counter activities, in the building at certain times each week. To facilitate this arrangement and in conjunction with state government agencies and others, including the local authority, who have contributed $100,000, the government has approved this facility as a rural transaction centre and, as part of its contribution, will install a high-speed telecommunication facility to enhance the operations therein.The government has approved 111 rural transaction centre projects, of which 57 are already operational. It has funded 101 licensed post offices to install electronic point of sale - EPOS - facilities to communities who lack this level of banking service. However, for many rural communities the closure of a bank building is as distressing as the loss of the banking service involved. An example is now available as to how this may be avoided and how a redundant or underutilised bank building can be converted to a busy, thriving and useful facility. The RTC field officer network is presently advising communities around Australia of these new opportunities along with the previous arrangements, which of course are still available. I trust all MPs will take the opportunity to advise their communities when these circumstances arrive, and achieve a better service for everyone.</DOC>

I am very proud to be part of a government which has delivered unprecedented benefits to Australian workers - almost a million new jobs, average weekly earnings up by 12 per cent in real terms and strikes at the lowest levels since records were first kept in 1913. Some confrontation, with strikes at the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913! Jay Pendarvis is a very intelligent man. I accept that. He has done a lot of great things for Australian industrial relations. If he says that I am a dangerous man, who am I to disagree? I will tell you whom I am dangerous to. I am dangerous to law-breakers and I am dangerous to people who want the Australian economy to live in the Dark Ages. Yes, of course I am dangerous to them. This is a government which wants to modernise our economy. It is a government which wants to ensure that the rule of law applies in the workplace just as much as it applies everywhere else. It is a government which wants to deliver a better deal to the workers of Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Can I also thank him for representing the Commonwealth at the historic ceremony yesterday for the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority and the restoration of environmental flows to the Snowy River. Can I also congratulate him on his assistance during that corporatisation process which came about through the cooperation of the New South Wales and Victorian governments with the Commonwealth and has delivered environmental benefits to Australia as well as ensuring the rights of irrigators are protected. The agreement yesterday will improve the health of both the Snowy and Murray rivers and will ensure that some 38 gigalitres of water are delivered into the Snowy and some 70 gigalitres are delivered into the Murray. Corporatisation of the Snowy is only one of the many achievements of this Howard government. This year we have seen the government scoop a number of major developments, including the $1 billion syngas and methanol plant on Burrup Peninsula, creating 1,000 jobs; a $1.2 billion Riotinto oil processing plant and integrated steel operation in Kwinana, creating 500 jobs; today we are seeing the turning of the sod on the Australian Magnesium Corporation's new plant, backed by CSIRO technology and, of course, a contribution from this government - again, a project in excess of $1 billion - and recently we have seen a huge win to Australia in the $25 billion LNG contract to China. And so the list goes on.I have been asked if there are alternative policies. In the lead-up to the last election the Labor Party had promised 230 reviews and inquiries, and what did their resources policy end up being? Half an A4 page in their election campaign. So, after nine months of this government, where is the Labor Party policy? Again, the shadow minister has called for yet another review. At least it is a belated recognition by the Labor Party of the importance of energy policy, but we wonder if they will make a serious contribution.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, although he did take a while to get to it. At 3.30 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, it was the last question so burning in the Labor Party's heart that it came after the character assassination on the Minister for Education, Science and Training and all the rest of it. I want to say how well the minister for education did today.  - Australia's own Braveheart as he came to the dispatch box. - I get asked a question about entity taxation. We published a -  - The government put out draft legislation on entity taxation. It was the subject of extensive consultation with the Board of Taxation. The Board of Taxation, back in February 2001, recommended that the legislation not proceed, and that was announced in the May 2001 budget - not last May's budget but 18 months ago. This was announced 18 months ago. Don't they do any research? I am waiting for the interjection. - The second part of the question is, effectively: why won't we do what Labor does? Since the announcement in the 2001 budget we have had an election. One might have thought that, if the Labor Party thought entity taxation was workable or achievable, it would have had that as a policy in the last election. Knowing that the member for Fraser most probably would ask a question after reading today's Australian, I went back to get the ALP policy on the issue. It was a policy that was released by the deputy leader, as he then was - now elevated to the lofty heights of Labor leader - the member for Hotham. There it is: `More resources to fight tax avoidance'. I read and I read and I read: not a mention of entity taxation. It was not your policy at the last election. So, to stand up here and say, `Why won't you join Labor?' when Labor did not have that policy at the last election - really, sometimes I wonder if they get you at the dispatch box to try to make the Leader of the Opposition look good. I table that. The Labor Party has no clothes or credentials in this area.Let us go to some of the measures which this government has put in place. This was the government that dealt with the R&amp;D syndicates; this was the government that closed down the infrastructure borrowing schemes - $4 billion; this was the government that did the non-commercial losses; this was the government that put in place the alienation of personal service income; this was the government that put in place the ultimate beneficiary test; this was the government that dealt with luxury car leasing. This was the government that put in place all of those matters. This is the government that does the heavy lifting. This is the government that is interested in Australia's future. You can engage in the kind of character assassination which you have tried today. We will get on with governing this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can inform him that the government do support very strongly the United Nations taking action. We believe the appropriate vehicle at this stage is the Security Council of the United Nations. I do not - for reasons I hope the Leader of the Opposition will understand - want to be totally prescriptive about the exact wording of a resolution or resolutions at this stage. You could have either one or two resolutions: one resolution calling on Iraq within a specified period of time to readmit people, followed by a resolution in another form in the event, which we all hope does not materialise, of Iraq not complying with the first resolution. I believe that the President of the United States correctly put upon the United Nations an obligation to look to Iraq's consistent failure to comply with previous resolutions.The central issue in front of the world community now is Iraq's failure to comply. That is the issue; that is the matter that should be of concern not only to this parliament but to parliaments around the world. The ways and means of ensuring that Iraq does comply with not only past but also future obligations established by the Security Council should be the preoccupation of the world. It is fair to say that has been the theme that has emerged from the statements of many over the past week. I certainly found in the speeches made to the General Assembly by both President Bush and the Secretary-General of the United Nations a remarkable congruence. Some interpreted Kofi Annan's speech differently from the interpretation I put on it, but I think both of them were talking of the responsibility of the Security Council and both of them were talking of the need for the Security Council to match the requirements and the need of the hour.As the Leader of the Opposition will know, in order to successfully pilot a resolution through the Security Council of the United Nations you need two things: you need to muster a majority of the members and you also need to avoid the imposition of a veto. It is rather like reforming the Australian Constitution; you sort of need a double majority. The important and reassuring thing to me is that a great deal of effort has been expended by the United States and others, including Australia. I can indicate to the House that amongst other messages conveyed to the US administration 10 days ago when our ambassador, at my request, spoke to senior people in the administration was not only the view of the Australian government that the United Nations should be involved but also the willingness of the Australian government to assist in an active, diplomatic way to encourage support for resolutions of the type referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.I do not intend at this stage, for the most obvious of reasons, to be more prescriptive than that. I believe the direction in which this debate is now heading is a very positive one. The onus is now being put on the United Nations to act. The country that is in the dock is Iraq. It is the failure of Iraq to comply with previous resolutions of the United Nations which is the issue, as it should be, because that is the cause of the problem. It is not the behaviour of the United States, it is not the behaviour of other countries around the world; it is the failure of Iraq to comply which is the problem. If Iraq had complied, we would not be considering in a properly serious fashion the issues that we are. </DOC>

 - As honourable members know, the foreign minister has been in New York for the past week and amongst other engagements was an address to the General Assembly, at which he presented very clearly and very cogently on behalf of this country our position regarding Iraq's failure to comply with previous resolutions of the Security Council. He has had the opportunity while in New York of meeting the United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell; the National Security Adviser, Dr Condoleezza Rice; the Russian Foreign Minister; the foreign ministers of a number of Arab countries; the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw; the Secretary-General of the United Nations; and, most recently and immediately before his boarding a plane to return to Australia, Dr Sabri, the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs.The purpose of that meeting, not surprisingly, was to discuss the current impasse between Iraq and the United Nations. I understand that the focus of the meeting was discussions relating to the return of weapons inspectors. The foreign minister reiterated public statements that Australia's position, along with that of many other countries, was that Iraq must immediately comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council. The foreign minister further explained that the best way to avoid any escalation in the situation was to allow the immediate, unconditional and unfettered return of weapons inspectors. Mr Downer, the foreign minister, also noted that if Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction then Iraq had absolutely nothing to fear from the return of weapons inspectors - and I must say that is a remark that I have heard in many parts of Australia over the last two weeks. However, if Iraq flouted UN Security Council resolutions then that would inevitably build an international consensus against Iraq.I inform the House that trade issues were only mentioned between the two foreign ministers in the context of Australia's broad bilateral relationship with Iraq. No mention, I am told, was made of wheat or other specific trade between Iraq and Australia.I had a telephone conversation with the foreign minister shortly before he left New York and he indicated during that discussion that he had not seen any substantial change in Iraq's position on the central issue of weapons inspections based on the discussions that he had with the foreign minister of Iraq. I repeat what I hope would be seen as the obvious: this government, and I presume to say this country, has no quarrel with the people of Iraq. We have a great quarrel with the government of that country. We have a great quarrel with that government not only because of the dictatorial character of the regime but because, even more importantly and more seriously, of the possession by that country - a possession, incidentally, which is not seriously disputed by any serious contributor to this debate over the past few weeks - of weapons of mass destruction. Given the lessons that the world has learned from the terrorist attacks on the United States last year, that dimension alone has implications for the way in which the world behaves.Tomorrow the foreign minister will deliver a statement to the parliament which, among other things, will outline in detail Iraq's failure to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions. He will also report in more detail on his discussions in New York and the opportunity he has had through those discussions to become completely up-to-date with the attitude and the thinking of other countries.Given that the issue now before the world is noncompliance, it is entirely appropriate at this stage that the parliament should have a statement from the foreign minister on that issue. It will afford to members an opportunity to contribute on that and, if they choose, on other aspects of this issue. But at this stage the issue is noncompliance. We are not talking about anything else and it is therefore appropriate that the foreign minister should deliver a statement in the terms I have outlined. </DOC>

 - The reason is that we are not, and I am not, asking this country to go to war against Iraq. The issue now is Iraq's noncompliance with the United Nations Security Council. - No. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question based on an implication that what the government is about to do is to be involved in military conflict with Iraq. That is not the case. I have said before, and let me repeat it here again today, that if this country were to decide to become involved in military conflict this government would take precisely the same approach as it took in relation to East Timor and was taken by the Hawke government in 1991. I would remind the parliament -  - I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in 1991, when the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, came before this parliament seeking parliamentary confirmation of a decision taken by his government to commit Australian forces to war, he reported that the decision had been taken by him after consultation with senior ministers and he reminded the parliament that committing Australian forces to military conflict is properly a function, under our Constitution, of the executive government.I have no quarrel with that proposition, and I would not have thought anybody in the Labor Party would have any quarrel with that proposition - nor, incidentally, do I have any quarrel with the proposition that, if the situation deteriorates and Iraq fails to comply with what I believe - and I think everybody believes or hopes - will be a resolution of the Security Council regarding weapons inspectors, there will obviously be a need for further debate.I give this assurance to the House: if this government were ever to take a decision to commit military forces, I would present a motion to this parliament - to this House - seeking support for that decision. I would not want in any way to deny any member of this parliament the opportunity to express their views on the issue. I would accept, above any other member of the government, the responsibility to explain and advocate that decision to the Australian people. But that is not the issue now - I hope it never does become the issue - and I would have thought that we all hope that it is not the issue. I would have thought it was the issue that, above everything else, we wanted to avoid. - The question of how another country, be it the United States or the United Kingdom, handles its debate is entirely a matter for that country and for that leader. I think the procedure that we are following is right. That procedure is for the foreign minister to report on his meetings in New York to detail Iraq's failure to comply. I fear that this may not be the last debate the House has on the issue. I would like to believe it might be, but I regret to express the view that it probably will not be and that there will be plenty of opportunities for the Leader of the Opposition and others to put their views.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite. I can tell him that, since the House last sat, the national accounts were released for the June quarter, which showed that the Australian economy grew by 0.6 per cent, and by 3.8 per cent through the year to June 2002. Whilst residential construction activity grew solidly, the government expects that it has now peaked. But business investment for the quarter grew by a very strong 8.1 per cent and is 15.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.The Australian economy continues to grow more strongly than the other developed economies of the world. Of the G7, only Canada is growing at above three per cent, with major Euro economies recording a little growth and Japan actually contracting. Most forecasters expect Australia will continue to lead the developed world through the course of 2002.Since the national accounts, we have also had the August labour force figures. I have consistently said that these do jump around from month to month, but they showed in August an unusually strong growth of 88,500 new jobs. We would expect that to recover a bit to trend over the forthcoming months. But it was interesting from this point of view: with the August labour force figures, the number of jobs created since this government came to office in March 1996 has now exceeded one million new jobs. I think all Australians will welcome the fact that one million new jobs have now been created under the coalition government since 1996 and, for the first time in Australia's history, the labour force in this country has topped 10 million people - that is, 10 million people are now in work. That is a fitting end to the situation 10 years ago, when one million were out of work and, under Labor, the unemployment rate hit 10.9 per cent. Now, one million new jobs have been created since the coalition was elected, unemployment is down to 6.2 per cent and 10 million Australians are now in the labour force.Nevertheless, we need to remain vigilant about the outlook. Obviously the drought is beginning to worsen in ways we would have hoped would not occur. ABARE has released its crop report, forecasting crop production to be only 22.2 million tonnes, which is considerably lower than last year. The world economy continues to look fragile. This was a topic of discussion at the APEC finance ministers meeting last weekend. The US authority is confident that the American economy will grow in 2002 but there are considerable risks in relation to stock market volatility and the very large United States current account deficit. It is important that we keep the Australian economy strong. That means good prospects for Australia, strength in our economy and more jobs for young Australians - one million jobs - but the government needs to keep its reform going in order to create more jobs for future Australians and to give them better opportunities in life.</DOC>

 - As to the first part of the question, I would have to check exactly what the defence minister said in December of last year. I do not presume an encyclopedic knowledge of these things. Whether it was September of this year or December of last year, I intend to check it. As to the statement that I made, I certainly do recall that and I want to say something about evidence. I would have thought that the proposition that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction is beyond argument. I watched a television program yesterday in which the member for Griffith participated. I heard the former UNSCOM officer, Richard Butler, assert in the most unambiguous terms that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. That was not dissented from by anybody in that program - and it covered a fair spectrum - except the charge d'affaires of the Iraqi embassy, who denied that there were any weapons of mass destruction. Most particularly, the member for Griffith, by his silence and I think by some of the things he said, agreed that Iraq does possess weapons of mass destruction. So I do not think there can be any argument amongst those who have followed this debate closely and amongst the community generally about the fact that Iraq does possess weapons of mass destruction. The extent to which they have developed and what has happened to them since 1998 cannot, except in a fairly fragmentary way, be asserted, because there have been no inspections since 1998. The most compelling piece of evidence to me that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and retains her nuclear aspiration is that Iraq will not let inspectors in. - Because the Leader of the Opposition has interjected on questions of evidence and because the member for Griffith has talked about evidence, may I take a moment of the House's time to go through the chain of events? - Central to this whole issue is Iraq's noncompliance with the Gulf War cease-fire resolution 687 of 1991 which required Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. This is a mandatory obligation on Iraq under the UN charter. In response to Iraq's lack of cooperation with WMD disarmament processes supervised by the UN, the Security Council between 1991 and 1999 adopted a series of resolutions reaffirming the need for Iraqi compliance. In the period before Iraq expelled United Nations inspectors in 1998, they uncovered considerable evidence that Iraq's declarations to the UN of the elements of its WMD program were incomplete in many areas.The final 1999 report of the UN special commission highlighted serious gaps in Iraqi declarations and concluded UNSCOM had not been able to verify Iraq's claims that all chemical and biological weapons had been destroyed. In the absence of UN inspection processes, the picture of Iraqi WMD activity since 1998 is more fragmentary but nonetheless very disturbing. There is a need, as I am sure the member for Griffith understands, to protect intelligence sources, and this limits the extent of detail that can be publicly released, but the accumulation of evidence from human and technical sources points to Saddam Hussein having continued or increased his WMD programs.Australian intelligence agencies advise that Iraq has continued attempts to procure equipment, material and technologies that could assist its weapons of mass destruction program. This material, of course, has been made available in the normal way to both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith. Iraq has also rebuilt facilities at some former known WMD sites. UNSCOM determined that it could not account for thousands of unfilled munitions, as well as hundreds of tons of precursor chemicals. These components together could provide a substantial chemical weapons arsenal. Iraq sought particularly to conceal from UNSCOM its program to produce and weaponise VX, the most lethal chemical weapon nerve agent. Since 1998, Iraq has rebuilt chemical production facilities at Fallujah, a known site in its chemical weapons program. Iraq has made covert attempts to procure precursor chemicals and production equipment useful for chemical weapons.On biological weapons, Iraq denied in 1991 that it had an offensive biological weapons program. Iraq only admitted such a program in 1995 after a senior Iraqi defector helped guide UNSCOM to a chicken farm where records of the biological weapons program were hidden. Iraq then admitted that it had produced thousands of litres of anthrax, botulinum toxin and aflatoxin for delivery as weapons in missile warheads, bombs and aerial spraying. But UNSCOM concluded in 1999 that Iraq had produced two to four times the volume of biological weapon agent finally declared to UNSCOM, much of it still unaccounted for.  - In 2001, Iraq commenced a program to renovate without UN approval a suspect biological weapons production facility, the al-Dawrah Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility. An Iraqi defector closely involved in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program reported in 2001 further development of biological weapons capability using mobile and hospital facilities. Iraq has continued to develop possible aerial biological weapon delivery systems.On nuclear weapons, Iraq had a major program to develop nuclear weapons at the time of the Gulf War. A crash program was also initiated after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to divert highly enriched uranium from research reactors for use in a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency, under resolution 687, was able to remove all known nuclear weapon usable material from Iraq and ensure the destruction of known uranium enrichment facilities. But Iraq has never provided complete information to the IAEA on its nuclear weapons program. Iraq has maintained the expertise and knowledge base to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. Australian intelligence agencies believe recent Iraqi procurement activities are consistent with efforts to resume a uranium enrichment program.There can be no doubt that Iraq has pursued WMD programs and has been prepared to use such weapons. There is no doubt that Iraq since 1991 has sought to deceive the international community about the extent of its WMD programs and to preserve key elements of these programs from the disarmament programs mandated by the United Nations Security Council. There is worrying evidence that since Iraq expelled United Nations inspectors in 1998 it has taken steps that indicate renewal of the WMD programs. The Australian intelligence community judges that Saddam Hussein's WMD ambitions have in no way diminished; that Iraq's nuclear aspiration remains; and that, if Iraq could obtain access to fissile material from overseas, that nuclear ambition could be achieved in a period of time measured by months rather than years - although a longer time frame would be involved if that material could not be obtained from overseas.Much of this debate has turned upon the question of evidence of the possession of weapons of mass destruction. It passes my understanding - and I think the understanding of all members on this side of the House - that anybody could seriously raise the issue of the existence of evidence. The strongest possible argument is the failure of Iraq to openly admit weapons inspectors. If Iraq has nothing to hide, why won't it let new weapons inspections take place? If Iraq has nothing to hide, why is it in breach of the United Nations resolutions? Nobody on the frontbench of the Labor Party seriously argues the proposition that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. In light of that, I can only regard the posturing of the member for Griffith as political point scoring and nothing else. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question, and I note that he is personally responsible for the creation of many, many jobs in his electorate. I can confirm to the House that the ABS figures released last week indicate that there are one million more jobs today than there were in March 1996. That is one million new jobs created under the policies of the Howard government. The Howard government has meant new jobs for one million Australians, and that in turn has meant new hope for those Australians who are still without work.This creation of one million new jobs under this government stands in contrast to the creation of one million unemployed under its predecessor. Not only are there more workers under this government, but they are significantly better paid. The basic award earnings are up by some eight per cent in real terms since March 1996. That contrasts with the experience under the former government when basic award earnings actually decreased by five per cent in 13 years. Average weekly full-time earnings are up by 12 per cent under this government. They rose by only four per cent over the 13 years of the former government. Strikes, I am pleased to say, are at their lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. That means that it is more important than ever to tackle those remaining bastions of mindless militancy - such as the construction industry, which has a strike rate five times the national average, and the metal industry, which has a strike rate of six times the national average.This government has been able to achieve these outstanding results because it can govern in the national interest. No-one owns the parties that constitute this government. This government can govern for all Australians because no outside forces are pulling the strings. I fully accept that members opposite did their best when they were in power, to the extent that the outside influences that controlled them allowed them to. Now they think that reform means commissioning one ex-ACTU president to hand a report to another ex-ACTU president while the current ACTU president stands by and monitors the whole process. This government is not like that. This government has created jobs because it governs in the interests of all Australians. We have done well and we are determined to do better in the future. We are not going to rest on our laurels. This parliament could create tens of thousands of new jobs if it were prepared to take the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small business. I call on members opposite to support that piece of legislation when it is reintroduced into the House this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question and the shadow minister opposite for his interjection, because I am delighted to tell the member for Dawson something about the benefits to her sugar farmers -  - The Australian sugar industry has been facing very serious difficulties over recent times. The impact of very low world prices in a corrupt international trading environment and, indeed, of forecasts that world prices are likely to remain poor for some considerable time have certainly cast a pall over the whole of the industry. There have been genuine concerns about its capacity to be competitive in such an environment, and there is a need for it to be able to take advantage of new opportunities which might well be available to cane farmers to enable them to ensure their viability for the future. The government has been concerned about these matters, and it commissioned the Hildebrand review to look at what options there might be for the industry. Now I think it is appropriate for us to respond to the issues raised by the Hildebrand review and the concerns of the industry as a whole. - Last week federal cabinet made a decision to support the sugar industry by providing a significant adjustment assistance package. In association with the state governments, this package is potentially worth up to $150 million. The centrepiece of the package will be a $60 million regional adjustment program, which will assist the industry to diversify and enable individual producers to most effectively meet the challenges of the years ahead. This will be done very much on a regional basis, following the successful model of the Sustainable Regions program, where local communities identify solutions for their concerns and then set about achieving those solutions with some government support. There will also be an interest subsidy scheme to support the replanting of this year's crop and some short-term welfare assistance. For those farmers who want to make the decision to leave, there will be some financial support to enable them to leave with a degree of grace.  - I have noticed the interjections opposite, which demonstrate quite clearly that Labor in Canberra has absolutely no concern whatsoever for the sugar industry; it has no plan, no vision and no ideas at all for it to retain its viability. Fortunately, Premier Beattie and the Queensland government have been a little bit more positive. Indeed, it has been interesting to note the positive approach of the Queensland Premier compared with the negative response of the Leader of the Opposition here in Canberra. The Queensland government have requested a memorandum of understanding with the Commonwealth to outline the commitment of both governments to an efficient and viable sugar industry in the years ahead. The Queensland government have argued for the need for industry reform, and we agree with them. They have argued for the need to remove any impediments in the sugar industry legislation, including their own act, and we agree with them. We want to work with the Queensland government to endeavour to achieve the very best possible outcome. I particularly compliment Tom Barton, the Queensland Minister for State Development, who has adopted a very positive approach towards this whole issue and has been willing to cooperate with the federal government to secure the future of this important industry. It is sad that he does not receive the support that he ought to from the federal members of the Labor Party here in Canberra.This package will look at alternative products and alternative options for the industry. It will give local communities the opportunity to help plan and build a progressive future for themselves and for the cane industry, which is so important to so many parts of Queensland. The package will be funded substantially by a levy, and that particular levy will give Australian consumers the opportunity to contribute towards ensuring we have a viable industry into the future. Australian consumers have benefited from some of the cheapest - probably, the cheapest - sugar in the world. This package will help ensure that we have a viable industry, a versatile and progressive industry, that continues to provide benefits to the whole Australian network.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and indicate to him that, of course, our growing and expanding trade contributes significantly to job opportunities in Australia. Certainly since 1996, exports have grown by over 50 per cent  - from $99 billion to $154 billion - and have contributed significantly to the one million new jobs that have been created in the Australian economy over that period. The statistics indicate that one in five jobs across the entire Australian economy rely on exports; in regional Australia, which is of particular interest to the member who asked the question, it is one in four jobs. That is how significant exporting is.The markets that we have developed over a number of years in the Middle East certainly play a significant role in the overall export effort. The Middle East has become Australia's fastest growing regional market. In 2001-02, exports into that region grew by 13.8 per cent, significantly higher than the average growth across the overall export effort. The Middle East market is now worth $7.7 billion each year to the Australian economy. Middle East exports have been growing, on average, by 22.7 per cent per year over the last four years, at a time when our total exports have grown at about 8.4 per cent per year. Exported to that region are products and manufactured goods including wheat, milk, meat, live animals, automobiles and automotive parts, and services such as education, medical and certainly tourism. While in the Middle East recently, I signed an air services agreement with the United Arab Emirates which increased their capacity into Australia. - That is certainly going to help tourism, particularly into Western Australia. There are now direct flights out of Perth to Dubai and has been an increase in the number of flights out of Sydney from four a week to seven a week - and I know the minister for tourism welcomes that.I recently led a trade delegation to Iran with more than 50 representatives from 34 Australian businesses to participate in the annual JMC - the joint ministerial council - between Australia and Iran. The delegation included companies like BHP, Woodside, International Wireless, the Newman Group of companies and Toyota as well as Curtin University and CSIRO in the services sector. In fact, CSIRO signed a deal while they were there. Of course, the delegation also included AWB Ltd, Australia's exporter of wheat. It is interesting to note that Iran is one of Australia's top three export markets for wheat, and while there, Iranian authorities confirmed a 530,000-tonne wheat order with AWB Ltd, bringing total wheat sales to Iran to around 1.9 million tonnes this year with the potential of more to come.As far as Australia's wheat farmers are concerned, at a time when they are gripped by drought, this is undeniably good news, and it follows on from recent orders of 50,000 tonnes each from Jordan and Libya, both also within that general region. Our trade relationship with the Middle East is growing. The bilateral relationship with Iran is going well; we agreed to begin negotiations on an investment promotion and protection agreement. It is important to note that we are maintaining a stable and good relationship with the markets of the region and that trade within the Middle East is significantly contributing to the jobs that have been generated throughout the Australian economy. </DOC>

 - That is of course, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, an entirely hypothetical question, and I do not intend to speculate. The Leader of the Opposition asked me to give a security assessment based upon a hypothesis that all of us hope and pray does not arise, and that is military action against another country. I have no intention of doing that, and I think it is absurdly irresponsible of the Leader of the Opposition to ask me to do so.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Makin for her ongoing interest. She is a great member and always a strong advocate for small business. There are around 1.2 million small businesses in Australia, and they employ 3.3 million Australians, which is almost half the entire private sector employment in Australia. It is important that small business have a voice in the formulation of policy. That is why this government established a number of advisory groups including the Small Business Consultative Committee, which meets quarterly to provide policy advice to the government, and the National Small Business Forum, which is a biannual summit for small business representative groups - and that is meeting in Canberra later this week. In addition, relevant cabinet submissions must take into account the impact on small business of new government policy. So we believe, on this side of the House, that when it comes to policy formulation, it is very important that small business have a voice; otherwise, you can end up with bad policy, as happened under the Keating government when they introduced the unfair dismissal laws for small business.I was asked about people's involvement. We now all regret on this side of the House the retirement of Senator Barney Cooney. We miss Barney. Senator Cooney was the friend of small business - the last friend of small business - in the Senate from the Labor Party. However, I have some good news. There is a new friend of small business in the Labor Party: the member for Hunter. The member for Hunter last weekend was `howled down' at a Labor Party conference when he moved a motion to end mandatory union affiliation for Labor Party members. He said that the Labor Party must expand its membership beyond the 24 per cent of the work force who are union members. We agree. We are supporting Joel on this; we are Joel's friends, when it comes to this. He said that the rules must be more flexible to allow small business people to join the Labor Party. We say, `Hear, hear!' That assumes, of course, that small business people want to join the Labor Party! We cannot make that bold assumption. Unfortunately, the member for Hunter was `hissed and booed' and, in his own words, the motion was `very soundly defeated'. You would think that the Leader of the Opposition would have been standing right beside the member for Hunter, cheering him on, saying that the Labor Party should encourage small business people to join it. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition was not there. He said -   -  - He was there. The Leader of the Opposition said, `They are always attacking us for being former unionists.' It is not `they', old son; it is your own person over there. - The Leader of the Opposition said, `Well, I'm proud to be a unionist.' We have confused signals coming from the Labor Party. On the one hand, you have the member for Hunter and Senator Barney Cooney standing up for small business; on the other hand, you have the Leader of the Opposition saying, `No, we're proud to be unionists. We're not prepared to kowtow to small business or others in the community.' The confused signals are not just limited to the role of small business in the Labor Party; they are also related to the Labor Party's own position in relation to its leadership. The media alert to the 2002 Country Labor Party conference notes Bob Carr as the leader of the Labor Party and Simon Crean as his deputy. I will table that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I thank him for the opportunity recently of being able to conduct a forum for aged care providers at Bundaberg in his electorate. Prior to the last election, this government made a number of commitments in relation to the aged care sector, the first of which was to promise an additional $200 million in recurrent funding over a period of four years. The first $51 million of that started to flow from 1 July this year, in the largest increase for recurrent funding - 4.5 per cent - to the aged care sector.Secondly, prior to the election we committed to conduct a pricing review of residential aged care in Australia. As the member for Hinkler alluded to in his question, I can inform the House that I announced this morning that that review will be conducted by Professor Warren Hogan, the Emeritus Professor of Economics from University of Technology Sydney. Professor Hogan has spent 30 years as Professor of Economics at Sydney University; he was Director of Westpac for a period of 15 years and also Director of AMP and AGC. He will carry out this important review on behalf of the government. The final terms of reference have also been provided to the aged care sector this morning - draft terms having been provided to them some weeks ago. I acknowledge and appreciate the comments on those terms of reference which the aged care sector provided. This review will be conducted over the period of the next 12 months or so; the review is asked to report by the end of the year 2003. This is an example of the government remaining committed to aged care in Australia to ensure that the long-term financing options for the aged care sector are put in place and remain in place to take account of the improved outcomes that are required of providers and also the underlying cost pressures faced by the sector. It is an example of a commitment to an efficient and viable aged care sector in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the - An opposition member - It's the member for Cowper. - honourable member for Cowper - I know what his seat is; he is next door to me on the mid-north coast of New South Wales - for his question and his interest in the jobs that are generated in his electorate from our export effort across the world. On Saturday, Australia, New Zealand and 10 South-East Asian countries signed a historic declaration to establish a more effective approach to increasing trade and investment and to facilitating economic integration among the nations within our region. Of Australia's total exports, 12.6 per cent go to South-East Asian countries - about $15.4 billion each year. To ensure an ambitious, results-oriented commitment, the 12 countries also agreed to Australia's recommendation to adopt a target to double the trade and investment within the region by 2010. That would see two-way trade increase from $32 billion to $65 billion, and two-way investment flows increase from $49 billion to $99 billion.This is a significant move forward in the relationship between Australia, New Zealand and our South-East Asian trading partners. This is the first agreement of this kind the ASEAN countries have signed with anybody. We are aware of negotiations that are taking place with the North Asian economies of China, Japan and Korea. It was interesting that Minister Rafidah Aziz from Malaysia in the press conference recognised the significance of this agreement, this accord. She said that the CEP, the closer economic partnership, would put Australia and New Zealand ahead of China and Japan in negotiating market opening measures with ASEAN countries. This is a significant document. It will provide the opportunity to harmonise regulations, to work much more closely together and to integrate the economies of the CER countries, Australia and New Zealand, and the South-East Asian trading partners. As far as the member for Cowper is concerned, there is someone in your electorate who is currently exporting to the North Asian countries. Keith Dowling Engineering have developed a particular bit of equipment and I am sure that, as a result of signing this agreement and this announcement on the weekend, they will be able to export into South-East Asian countries as well.In an article in the Age on 12 September, a visiting fellow at the Asia Pacific School of Economics and Management at the ANU commented that Australia's pursuit of an FTA with the United States would damage Australia's ties with our major East Asian trading partners. The signing of a $25 billion LNG contract with China along with the signing of this declaration over the weekend illustrate that this is certainly not the case; that it is not a zero sum game.

 - I would like to thank the member for Kennedy. I know he has a very keen interest in the sugar industry along with members in the coalition, including me. We have a large sugar industry. There are many issues and I certainly welcome the sugar package and the impact that it is going to have, and of course the restructuring package. A lot of these issues really are not within my portfolio jurisdiction. I appreciate the consideration that you have given me, member for Kennedy. We have had many good discussions on these issues before. As far as the role that Family and Community Services has, I know Centrelink in the past have played a very crucial role, particularly in the delivery of a lot of the programs in the previous sugar package. I acknowledge the work that they have done. Specifically regarding FACS, we do not have a team going into particular industries. We are normally asked to do that by other portfolios within the government. Without question, we stand ready to assist particularly with the sugar roll-out package. I am very glad that certainly the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister have been more than willing to listen to the concerns of constituents in Queensland, New South Wales and the small industry up in Western Australia when it comes to the welfare of those families in the sugar belt.</DOC>

 - To answer the interjection, yes there have been a million new jobs. You may have missed that a little earlier on. I thank the member for Robertson for his question and his ongoing interest in Work for the Dole and local programs and community organisations that have benefited from it. I particularly thank him for assisting with the Prime Minister's award to the Kariong community preschool relocation project, one of the 53 awards on top of the 11 that were presented here by the Prime Minister before the winter recess. At that time, people from around Australia were recognised for their valuable contribution as participants, sponsors and coordinators of Work for the Dole. Local members and senators from all parties have been out and about providing these awards to Work for the Dole community organisations and participants over the last few weeks and, in doing so, giving ample recognition to people who are contributing to their community. In our last sitting, I indicated to the House that Work for the Dole had surpassed 10,000 projects nationally. The department has come back and informed me that that was not quite correct. In fact, this month that 10,000th project will be racked up. There have been some more positive comments from different groups about Work for the Dole backing up those from the member for Werriwa, who of course is a strong supporter of Work for the Dole, as are all of those who sit on this side of the chamber. These comments, reported in the Mercury on Wednesday, 4 September, go to the heart of what makes this program so good. Mr Lynch, who is the Director of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, when talking about the Riverkeep 2 project in Tasmania - one of the Prime Minister's award recipients - said:This is a bit unusual but, politics aside, we could not have achieved this without the Federal Government's Work for the Dole Scheme, Mr Lynch said.  My Lynch said that it - the Work for the Dole activity Riverkeep 2 project - had been a rewarding experience for young trainees on the scheme, learning such diverse skills as handling a power boat or learning first aid. And he said working to clean up the Derwent was something people of all political persuasions would agree was worthwhile.I am sure everyone on this side of the House and people like the member for Werriwa would agree with that. It is interesting that Mr Lynch is not only the Director of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust but also a former policy development staffer for Greens Senator Bob Brown, a former Green Independent candidate down there and coordinator of the office of the Green Independents. His is just another voice in the Australian community saying how positive Work for the Dole is for the community, for conservation, for individuals and for the economy as a whole. Everyone on this side of the House - the National Party and the Liberal Party members - understands the worthwhile nature of this project. Obviously, those who support the Green movement - the far Left - understand, and 89 per cent of participants agree with most Australians. All that is left to understand how worth while it is is that little pointy edge, the one that sits in front of us. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to join with the far Left, the Right, liberals and the centre of the Australian community in understanding the worthwhile nature of Work for the Dole and to get behind the rest of Australia and support it.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no, it is not. Can I say, in elaboration on that, a couple of things. - I am glad the honourable member asked me the question, because I have made the point on numerous occasions in the past few months that one of the things that I find sticks in the craw of the average Australian is that people who have been at the helm of the affairs of companies that subsequently go down the drain end up walking away from those companies with very large emoluments.  - As a consequence of that, there are a number of proposals - both legislative and regulatory. The legislative proposals are under preparation and, in the case of the regulatory proposals generally, as a consequence of a number of things that I and other members of the government have said on this subject over the past few weeks, we have seen some quite meritorious examples of people who have been willing to abandon future remuneration increases - as occurred in relation to the Executive Chairman of Westfield, Mr Frank Lowy. I compliment Mr Lowy for the public-spirited decision he made. It is typical of the man who has made an enormous contribution to this country and who is, in my view, one of this country's foremost business figures. I would also draw attention to the example set by Mr John Ralph, Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank and a director of Telstra, and to the comments and commitment made by Mr David Murray of the Commonwealth Bank in relation to certain forms of directors' share options. I think some of those, to use a colloquialism, have been `a bit rich', and I think the Australian public is entitled to feel that there is not sufficient restraint. I am glad to see that corporate Australia itself is beginning to do something about that.In relation to the Ansett employees, I would remind the parliament that, when Ansett collapsed a little over a year ago, on behalf of the government I made a commitment to guarantee the basic entitlements - that is, the holiday pay, the long service leave et cetera and redundancies - up to a period of eight weeks. That guarantee has been honoured in full. Left unpaid to the workers, as I understand it, are the redundancies over and above the eight-week period. Eight weeks was chosen by the government because it was the community average. Also, in the course of answering this question, I make the point to the honourable member that, when your party was last in power, it did not have a package anywhere near as generous as the one we introduced. You had 13 years to do something about this and worker after worker lost his or her job and lost his or her entitlements, and there was absolutely nothing done about it.In answer to the honourable member, I do not think it is fair, no; I do not. I can understand people seeing an imbalance in that; I really can. I make no observation on the particular conduct but the fact is that, when a company, through palpable mismanagement, goes into liquidation or administration, I can understand people who miss out on what they regard as their full entitlements feeling that it is not fair that former directors who were well remunerated get payments over and above their annual salaries. We have done more about that inequity than Labor did in 13 years. We have introduced a guarantee and, through the measures that I have outlined, we have begun to bring about a change in the attitude of corporate Australia. I thank those corporate leaders who have responded. I encourage others to take a leaf out of the books of Frank Lowy, John Ralph and David Murray. I think they have set an excellent example and I think, in all of those cases, we will have a fairer and better community as a result.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. He is a very strong advocate for education, whether it is supporting young people at risk with KYM in the Shire of Yarra Ranges or whether it is at the Lilydale Campus of Swinburne University, and he is joined in that by the member for Deakin. The things that will most inform and change our future are not necessarily the things we know but the things that we do not know. That is why Australia's higher education sector is critically important to the future of Australia. This government is undertaking a widespread review of Australian universities. It is thinking not so much of the state of universities today - or, indeed, next year - but of a world-class economy and society 20 years from now and the role that universities will play in them. - I have initiated a review of the financing and administration of Australia's 38 publicly funded universities, and we have released seven discussion papers to inform a mature and dispassionate debate. I have established a specialist unit within my department and have brought the Business Council and industrial relations expertise into that process to inform the debate. We have had 57,000 hits on the education department web site for the review. We have also had 438 submissions to this review - four of them from state Labor governments. We have also had the National Tertiary Education Union and the National Union of Students involved. We have conducted 49 focus groups with 800 people covering 200 hours of consultations. Next month I will be meeting with state and territory education ministers to put on the table a number of issues for which they have responsibility in relation to Australian universities, and I will also be conducting a two-day symposium here in Canberra to finally put together our thoughts in relation to Australian universities.It needs to be recognised that, whatever our circumstances, wherever we live and whatever our politics, `one size fits all' funding arrangements for Australian universities is a prescription for long-term mediocrity for the country. Last week, the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee spoke to the national financing conference here in Canberra at the Australian National University, which we supported. He said:Put simply, there is widespread consensus within the higher education system, government and the broader community that the current funding and regulatory framework for universities is unsustainable ... It is inhibiting institutional growth and diversification and it is beginning to threaten the quality of education that our universities are able to offer.The fact is that, whether it is in outer eastern Melbourne, in the Peel region north of Perth or in south-east Queensland, we will not be able to deliver university education where it is most needed if we continue with the status quo. The only thing that the Labor Party is able to say in relation to this is what the member for Jagajaga said last week to the financing conference, and that is, `We are thinking about higher education policy.' In other words, there are no policies. The Labor Party has a `one size fits all' solution to every single problem, and that is public money - somebody else's money.</DOC>

 - The announcement made this morning by the Secretary-General of the UN that he had received a communication from the Iraqi government to the effect that Iraq was willing - so it said - to unconditionally readmit United Nations weapons inspectors is a welcome development. It is a cautious first step towards a solution of this very difficult issue without resort to military conflict. In those terms and in that context, the government welcomes this development. But, given Iraq's history of misrepresentation - of pretending to do one thing yet doing another - I believe that the world should welcome this development with a great deal of caution and a great deal of reserve, even with a touch of scepticism, given what has happened in the past. Experience with Iraq demonstrates that the international community must not take Saddam Hussein's commitments at face value. We have years and years of defiance of UN resolutions to support that reservation and that scepticism. And in our desire, understandably, to welcome a positive development, we ought to keep that very much in mind. We are pleased that Iraq has agreed to start immediate discussions on practical arrangements for the return of the inspectors. The international community, however, is not in the business of negotiating those arrangements with Iraq. They have been comprehensively set down in Security Council resolutions.It must also be recognised that this move by Iraq is in direct response to the growing pressure of the international community, most particularly the address to the United Nations by President George Bush. Those in the community who have criticised the United States President would do well to pause for a moment and to understand that, had it not been for that pressure and, particularly, that presentation made by the President, this action taken by Iraq would not have been forthcoming. In the same context, I draw the House's attention to the fact that only yesterday morning our own foreign minister had the opportunity to communicate directly in a face-to-face meeting with the Iraqi foreign minister the view of the Australian government that weapons inspectors should be readmitted. I want to take the opportunity to compliment the foreign minister on the way in which he has conducted this matter in New York on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people. He will have the opportunity, as he should, to report not only on Iraq's serial noncompliance with United Nations resolutions but also on the discussions he has had in New York with the Iraqi foreign minister, the United States Secretary of State, the United States National Security Adviser and others.In summary, we are cautiously optimistic, but the world would be deluded to naively imagine that this is the end of the difficulty and that the mere expression of willingness on the part of Iraq to readmit weapons inspectors means that the world can take its eye off this issue. That is exactly what Iraq has wanted the world to do, and successfully achieved in encouraging the world to do, over past years, and I do not believe that the world should make that mistake. Iraq must now move very quickly to fulfil its obligations. The international community will not accept further delays or obstruction of UN weapons inspectors, and the Iraqi government should have no illusions about this.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I think what should now occur is that Iraq should properly engage directly with the Security Council regarding the implementation of its stated intention to allow the return of the weapons inspectors. In the light of what has occurred today, it would be robbing both Australia and the international community of the needed flexibility if we prescribe in advance the resolutions that might be presented. The intelligent thing to do now is to engage Iraq and see what emerges from that engagement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I appreciate the concern he has for this whole issue of terrorist threats to Australia and others in South-East Asia. The honourable member will, I know, be aware that the Singapore government announced yesterday the arrest of 21 people for involvement in terrorist related activities. I believe all of these people were Singaporean citizens. The government welcomes this action by the Singaporean government. This follows the arrest of 15 people in December of last year. These arrests are the result of a very extensive investigation by the Singaporean authorities into the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist network and threats to our embassy and to other embassies in Singapore last year.The Australian High Commission in Singapore was subject to a very serious threat at the end of last year. The threat was uncovered by the Singaporean intelligence authorities with the assistance of the Malaysians. All I can say is not only are we enormously appreciative of the effective intervention by the Singaporean and Malaysian authorities but over and above that we certainly very much welcome the subsequent arrests announced yesterday of further people associated with this plot and this network known as Jemaah Islamiah.The government has been very concerned by recent information that we have received about a generic threat to Australian and United Nations interests in South-East Asia. In particular, in East Timor there has been information received relating to direct threats to Australian and UN interests and to United States interests throughout many parts of South-East Asia. We took very decisive measures during the course of last week. Non-emergency staff and dependents of the Australian embassy in Dili were offered assisted departure on a voluntary basis. The ambassador and a small core of staff remained in East Timor to provide advice and assistance to the Australian community. All of our regional South-East Asian posts have been asked to review their level of security, and many of them have adopted additional security measures in cooperation with their host governments.In conclusion, let me say that the Australian government has been working very closely with regional governments on this whole question of terrorism - not just the United States and other governments beyond the region. We have signed memoranda of understanding on terrorism with Indonesia and Malaysia, and we are in the process of negotiating a like MOU with Thailand. Australia and Indonesia are going to host a joint conference in Bali in December of this year to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. I met a couple of days ago with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and both of us are very much looking forward to cohosting this conference, which will be a region-wide conference. It will involve a large number of countries from around the region to reinforce the strength of our regional commitment to work together to deal with the problem of terrorism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax. I can inform him that Australia is at the forefront of international efforts to develop a response to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We have played a leading role in the creation of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and we provide significant resource support, including accommodation and funding for its secretariat.In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 we passed the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002, which strengthened the institutional framework and made it an offence to provide or collect funds intended to facilitate terrorist activities. Following the money trail is an important tool in dealing with terrorism and, under the charter of the UN antiterrorism measures regulations 2001, it is possible to list terrorist organisations which, when matched up with bank accounts, can lead to the freezing of their assets.On Friday, three accounts were frozen as a consequence of matching with suspected terrorist groups. The amounts involved were small, but I should point out that all of the work done on the events of September 11 last year has indicated that the financing of the terrorist activity involved was with small amounts. It is estimated that, between the 19 hijackers, a sum as low as $300,000 may have been all that was necessary to finance their activity, including paying for flying lessons.It is a criminal offence for a person or a bank in Australia to deal with a freezable asset, and a freezable asset is one controlled by a gazetted entity. If any of those account holders believe that their assets have been wrongly frozen, they have the opportunity to contact the Australian Federal Police and discuss matters relating to it. This was a subject that was discussed in some detail at the APEC finance ministers meeting last weekend, where Australia was at the forefront of encouraging international efforts against the financing of terrorism. It will certainly be the subject of further discussions at the annual meeting of the World Bank on the weekend after this one. We intend to make every effort to bring to bear, on the financing of terrorism through our financial system, a contribution which will close down terrorist activities and make it possible to close down a source of financing for those heinous acts.</DOC>

 - In an article in the Melbourne Age in early June, Barry Jones, who was the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party and the member for Lalor for a number of years, applied his considerable intellect to what he considered to be the biggest mistake of the previous Labor government. He said that its biggest mistake was to amalgamate the then colleges of advanced education with the then existing universities. At that time, the Labor Party, to its credit, recognised that Australian taxpayers could not fully fund the education of every Australian who wanted to go to university and it introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.The member for Jagajaga has issued 35 press releases - 12,185 words - and not one of them this year has had anything constructive to offer in relation to the future of Australian universities. What needs to be remembered is that, in 1991 and moving into 1992, there were over one million Australians who did not have jobs, the interest rate on home mortgages was 17 per cent, businesses were paying 23 per cent on their overdraft and there were 100,000 students who could not get a place in an Australian university under the policies of the Australian Labor Party. The fact of it is that this government is thinking very much about Australia's future. What the government is doing is thinking about where Australian higher education is going to be and how it is going to drive the economic development of this country for the next 20 years. What we have done is put onto the agenda for public consideration a variety of policy choices which we as a nation have to make. One of those choices, which has been argued by the Australian vice-chancellors, is that Australian universities need a degree of deregulation - that is what the vice-chancellors have said. What this government is doing is putting its nose to the grindstone and thinking about policies which serve the best interests of Australia. And, when the Labor Party wants to make a constructive contribution, I can assure you, Mr Speaker, it will be welcomed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and again acknowledge her vital role in ensuring the future of what were once Hazelton and Kendell Airlines, now flying as Rex. I also welcome the opportunity to set the record straight on a number of matters where I think the government has done the right thing by Australian workers and yet seems to be facing a barrage of opposition to that being recognised by certain people in the trade union movement in Australia - so much so, in fact, that I cannot help observing that at this point at least those opposite seem so embarrassed that they are not prepared to associate themselves with the ACTU on it.I am aware of comments in today's Melbourne Age attributed to Ansett's administrators that legal proceedings currently before the Victorian Supreme Court relating to superannuation could further delay staff entitlement payments by up to two years. In addition, I am aware of statements made by the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, who said:Not one dollar of the money collected from the air passenger ticket levy has yet gone to Ansett workers.I do not know how any man, in any conscience, could make such a claim. It is outrageous beyond all belief. Furthermore, he went on to say that the government was using the levy to double-dip on employee entitlements. These are just outrageous claims. They are grossly misleading and they belie completely the reality - that this government has done more than any previous Labor government or any government in Australia with union affiliations to help workers caught in a very difficult situation, as Ansett workers were following the collapse of that airline. We moved to ensure that workers could receive their basic employee entitlements to community standards within weeks, with minimum delay, and we established SEESA. That provided a mechanism for moneys to flow very quickly. As of 10 September, $330 million has been paid out under SEESA to almost 13,000 Ansett group employees, which is an average of around $26,000 per worker. I pose this very simple rhetorical question: how much would the workers have received if the government had not intervened? To this point in time, absolutely nothing. - To date, the government has recovered just $123 million from the ticket levy. In the third report to creditors, posted on the Internet last night, Ansett's administrators state:Employees have so far received entitlements of:·	100 cents in the dollar for unpaid wages;·	100 cents in the dollar for annual leave, long service leave, time in lieu and other days;·	100 cents in the dollar for pay in lieu of notice, and for up to 8 weeks of redundancy.More than 3,500 employees have now been paid in full. If we had not intervened, none of this would have happened. And the facts contrast very sharply indeed with the outrageous, misleading and downright dishonest claims of the ACTU - so outrageous that those opposite have not even tried to associate themselves with them, which shows how far beyond the pale they are. We have done more to help workers who have suddenly found themselves without a job through no fault of their own than Labor did in 13 years.Let me conclude by saying that we are not double-dipping in any way, shape or form. We have clearly indicated that, if there is any over-recovery, we will cease the levy as soon as possible. If it proves that there is any over-recovery, the benefit will go to aviation and the tourism industry, which have been hard hit by the events of September last year. I close by saying that I sincerely hope that the administrators can obtain the maximum return from remaining asset sales so that the staff and other creditors, including the Australian taxpayer, can obtain the best possible outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. Just for the benefit of the House, what happened was that, about four months ago, I was standing outside the Queensland University of Technology, waiting to go inside. I introduced myself to a lady next to me and I asked her, `What do you think about universities?' and she said, `I don't know really. I applied to go to one once but I didn't get in.' She said, `Are you going in there?' and I said yes. She said, `Can you tell them something for me? I work very hard, and my taxes pay for what goes on inside there. When they come out and apply for the same job as me, they will get the job.' There are a number of issues in that. Whilst the Labor Party might see this as the everyday person being the object of derision and might have very little regard for the mechanics out there in the electorate of Macarthur and very little regard for the people at the checkout at Woolworths, these are the men and women who basically finance the $6.4 billion in public funds that will go into Australian universities this year - their hard work. When the member for Leichhardt was cleaning toilets at the Mareeba train station, he was funding the education of the Leader of the Opposition, for example. - The point here is that university education provides a critically important basis -  - for the economic and social development of our society. It essentially passes the soul from one generation to the next. But there is also a very strong personal benefit that is derived from an education: the average male graduate earns $620,000 more over a lifetime and the average female graduate $412,000 more than someone who does not go to university. Let us not ever forget that it is the hardworking men and women in this country, who have never seen inside universities, who fund what goes on inside them. When we are formulating policy in relation to our future, we will not ever lose sight of the fact that Australians should have choices available to them. Just going to university does not in itself make you better than any other human being, but it is important that you make a contribution to that from which you have derived a benefit.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. As the member for Ryan knows, the policy of this government is clear: it is jobs, jobs and more jobs. Under the policies of this government one million new jobs have been created since March 1996, in contrast to the one million unemployed created under the policies of its predecessor. I regret to inform the House that the ACTU has applied to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to increase redundancy entitlements from eight weeks pay after four years of service to 16 weeks pay after six years of service. In addition, the ACTU wants to extend redundancy entitlements to casual workers and, perhaps most seriously, the ACTU wants to end the small business exemption from redundancy liabilities. In addition, the Queensland Council of Unions has made a similar application to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission.I am sure all members will be pleased to know that this government has sought to intervene in the Queensland case, and we will most vigorously and strenuously oppose the ACTU's application before the federal commission. There is a fundamental principle here: it is just wrong to pay people more to lose their jobs than to keep their jobs. The last thing that small business needs is to suddenly face a contingent liability of about $8,000 for every long-term employee should a business go out of operation.I have been asked about alternative policies. To its credit, the Queensland government is opposing the removal of the small business exemption. I congratulate Premier Beattie for showing leadership on this matter. No-one expects leadership from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition never stops talking about foreign policy but, when it comes to workplace relations, the former ACTU president seems to have taken a vow of silence. He said nothing about the strikes in the motor industry; he said nothing about the Qantas strike; he said nothing about the war being waged inside the AMWU; and now he is saying nothing at all about the ACTU's redundancy grab. I think the people of Australia have a message: `Speak to us, O silent Simon; speak to us! What do you think? What do you think about the ACTU's latest job destroying grab?' If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to demonstrate that he was bigger than his background and that he was serious about creating jobs, he would state his view on the ACTU's redundancy application.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. The government is committed to making a full and proper contribution to combating global warming by working to meet the target that we negotiated at Kyoto. In answer to the honourable member's question, I am aware of recent analysis which supports the government's decision not to ratify the Kyoto protocol at the present time because it is not in Australia's national interest to do so. I would like to make the point that the basis of the government's decision has been highlighted today by the release of information showing that the ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere are now beginning to decline and predictions are that the hole in the ozone layer will begin to shrink by 2005. That is as a result of the working of the Montreal protocol in which Australia has taken a leading role.There is a very striking difference between the Montreal protocol and the Kyoto protocol because the Montreal protocol includes all countries, including developing countries, and all countries have obligations under that protocol. This is precisely what Kyoto does not achieve. The Kyoto protocol does not put in place an effective global regime. It deals with only 25 per cent of global emissions. Most major emitters are outside the regime. There are no legal obligations on developing countries to reduce their emissions by a specified amount. Under these circumstances, Australia is continuing to press strongly for a proper global approach to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions which could include all major emitters. The absence of our main competitors means that it is not in our interest to ratify this protocol. This was supported by Professor Warwick McKibbin, whose research was released last week. He said: By any calculation, the sum of the future costs to Australia of ratifying Kyoto far outweigh the sum of the future costs of not ratifying. More importantly, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the extent of these costs which, even on our most optimistic assumptions, support the government's decision about the long-term costs of ratification.That is the conclusion of Australia's leading modeller and researcher of greenhouse gas emissions and the Kyoto protocol. I was very interested to see that yesterday Professor McKibbin was joined by an influential ally. Simon Crean, I think, knows who this ally is. He does not want to acknowledge it because the ally is the Premier of Queensland, Mr Peter Beattie. Mr Beattie stated at a press conference that Queensland and other states would be disadvantaged by the Kyoto protocol. When challenged by a reporter who said, `That's what John Howard is arguing as well,' Mr Beattie replied, `Yeah sure, well it's true. I mean, I'm just telling the truth.' It is a great relief to see a Queensland Labor premier telling the truth. That is very different to what the Leader of the Opposition has been saying and it is a very different position, of course, also to Premier Carr in New South Wales. But I have to say that Premier Beattie fingered Premier Carr. He said: I understand Bob's position but he is the only Australian premier that wins from it, and that's fine. If I was in that position I'd be out there grandstanding as well.So that is what one Labor premier thinks of another Labor premier - so much for standing on principle and standing on an effective position on greenhouse gas emissions for Australia. What about federal Labor? Well, as we know, Simon Crean has been prepared to write off the Queensland industries. - The Leader of the Opposition has been prepared to write off industries and jobs in Queensland, Western Australia and other states. He has been his usual opportunistic self, joining the Kyoto conga line of those who seem to find it too difficult to think through these positions. Unlike the Labor Party, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, this government is not prepared to start shipping Australian jobs and industries overseas. Instead of this irresponsible attitude by the Labor Party, I urge the opposition to start cooperating with the Howard government, to put in place a long-term national framework and to work for a proper global framework within which greenhouse gas emissions can be properly produced and global climate warming combated effectively.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Obviously, I do not have a copy of the contract between Trafigura and whoever the supplier is, and so I cannot confirm that. If the honourable member would like to give me a copy of the contract, I would be very happy to read it. He asked me to confirm what is in a contract between two commercial parties. I do not have a copy of the contract, so how can I confirm what is in it?The government's announcement, as I recall it, applies from Tuesday. It means that ethanol that is used in petrol from Tuesday will have a 38c excise. I consider that to be appropriate. Petrol has a 38c excise. If ethanol is an alternative fuel, it ought to be taxed on a similar basis. Otherwise, if anon-excisable fuel were to replacean excisable fuel, it would open up the opportunity for imports to be brought into the country to take an advantage of that disparity, which would obviously affect the revenue. I consider that to be appropriate. It applies from Tuesday of last week. The parties that are dealing in relation to that matter are now on notice in relation to the contractual situation. I think they will make their own decisions accordingly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He is a real advocate for Northern Territory small businesses - unlike the member for Lingiari, who tries hard! The economic management of the country delivers a safe, secure and good trading environment for Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. Wages are higher, inflation is down, interest rates are down and industrial disputes are down, which is a great story. Employment is up, with the creation of one million new jobs since this government came into office.Recently, in Sydney, I attended the Franchise Council's annual conference. Franchising is a rapidly growing industry that covers 50,000 small businesses in Australia and employs 678,000 people, which is a massive increase over the last few years. It is an important and growing business. In one of those awkward moments, as many of my colleagues will understand, the Master of Ceremonies, Peter Switzer said, `We're going to start polling the audience.' With 500 people, it is a bit like the worm at election time - you never know quite how it is going to go. There is a danger that it could go down and there is a danger that it could go up, depending on which way the question is framed.Question 1 to the 500 small business people was, `Do you support the federal government's exemption of small business from the unfair dismissal laws?' That was a reasonable question. It is an issue that the government have been running pretty hard on, and we think it is important. Of the 500 delegates, 78 per cent responded with yes - `Yes, we support the federal government; that's the coalition's policy.' Twenty-two per cent said, `No, we don't support the federal government's policy on unfair dismissal; that's the Labor Party's policy.' That is a pretty good result. That is a distinction at university - if the member for Hotham goes back for a postgraduate degree. We will have to call on the member for Leichhardt to go back to Mareeba, but it might take a bit of work.Question 2, a more difficult question, was: `Are you happy with the GST and the new tax system?' You would wonder how that would go with 500 small businesses. We well remember the Leader of the Opposition coming into this place with Hockey Bear pyjamas and salad bags, saying it would be Armageddon for Australia's small businesses. In the survey of 500 small businesses being asked the question, `Are you happy with a GST and the new tax system?' 80 per cent said yes and 20 per cent said no. So, of 500 small businesses, 80 per cent supported the coalition and 20 per cent supported the Labor Party. - We know John Della Bosca is still out there looking for his head somewhere down Pitt Street or Macquarie Street. We are also aware that the member for Hunter and Senator Barney Cooney are there saying, `Yes, small business should have a stronger voice in the Labor Party.' The only person that is saying no is the Leader of the Opposition. Maybe we would like to know what Bob Carr thinks, because Bob Carr thinks that maybe Simon should just be his deputy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I know that he is concerned about ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have effective tools to fight crime in his electorate and in the community generally. Australia has a first-rate national regime for telecommunications interception. Unlike many other countries, including the United States, the use of TI in Australia is regulated under one regime and subject to considerable safeguards. Warrants are issued only by senior judicial or legal officials. The use is overseen by Commonwealth and state ombudsmen and is the subject of an annual report to this parliament. Such warrants are used only in the case of serious offences. They are most commonly used in the investigation of narcotic offences, drug trafficking and murder. These are offences which the Howard government is committed to combating, in cooperation with the states and territories.In the year ended 30 June 2001, lawfully obtained interception information was given in evidence in 890 prosecutions. In some cases, the use or availability of intercepted information led to guilty pleas by offenders, thus saving the time and expense of trials. As the 2000-01 report indicates, there has been an increase in the number of telecommunications warrants issued over recent years. This in part reflects an increase in the use of telephone services, particularly mobile services. We know that suspects, particularly those engaged in drug related crime, are increasingly exploiting technology to support their criminal activity. One way to do this is by using multiple services which, in turn, requires multiple warrants. New technologies mean law enforcement agencies are increasingly able to use interception as an investigative tool in circumstances where alternative means would be ineffective.I am asked about alternative policies. It appears, from recent comments by the member for Banks, that the federal Labor Party is suspicious of or has doubts about the use of telecommunications interception to fight crime. If Labor wants the use of TI cut back, it should spell out the areas of criminal activity that should not be investigated. If you follow the logic of the member for Banks, it is better to have criminals roaming the streets than to use new technology to catch them and put them away. The member for Banks should ask the law abiding citizens of Punchbowl and Bankstown which areas of criminal activity they would like to see dropped from the TI list. The member for Banks claims that Australian law enforcers use 20 times more phone interception than their US counterparts. Unlike Labor, we take the view that our system is second to none in both national consistency and accountability mechanisms. As an editorial in today's Sydney Morning Herald points out, the member for Banks is drawing a dubious comparison. The editorial states that the position of the member for Banks is:...doubtful on two fronts. First, apples and oranges. Australian tapping powers emanate from one federal law and are easier to identify than in US records, where they are granted by three tiers of government, often using different definitions. Second, it stretches credulity to argue that a policing tool so effective at gathering convictions would not be fully exploited worldwide. That would be negligence by law enforcers.Organised criminal activity such as drug trafficking requires flexible, modern responses from law enforcement. Telecommunications interception is one such flexible tool. The Sydney Morning Herald editorial goes on to point out that phone taps have: caught a New South Wales minister fixing prison releases, identified al-Qaeda terrorists fixing September 11, caught Hansie Cronje fixing cricket matches, and caught gang rapists terrorising teenage women in Sydney. The Howard government is committed to ensuring modern law enforcement tools are available to fight crime in Australia in a controlled, regulated environment. The Howard government's system gives us that. Nobody knows what Labor is offering.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. It is an undeniable fact that as air services between countries increase so does trade and investment. Last week in Dubai, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister - who had negotiated the new bilateral air services agreement with the United Arab Emirates - I signed that agreement and also announced an expansion in the number of flights per week to Sydney by Emirates Airlines from four to seven. The statistics speak for themselves. Emirates have been flying to Australia since 1996 and, in that time, they have increased the number of flights per week from three to 15 and soon to be 18. At the same time, two-way trade between Australia and the UAE has doubled over that period, from $1.1 billion in 1999 to $2.2 billion in 2001.It is not just what you carry on those aircraft that counts; it is the fact that there is a constant link between the peoples of the two countries, particularly of the respective business communities. Importantly in this relationship, wheat exports to the UAE remain strong at about 300,000 tonnes, or about $150 million worth, a year. I know that is of significant importance to the member for Parkes; and, in terms of the current security environment, along with the good solid market presence we have in Iran, Libya, Jordan and other countries in the Middle East, it proves the point that we have created a very sound market presence in that part of the world. We are continuing to develop that by expanding our air service linkages to the Middle East, which is one of the fastest growing markets that we have in the world.As I said at the outset, it is an undeniable fact that people-to-people contacts grow as a result of expansion of air services. Our government intends to continue to do that - I know it is a specific policy of the Deputy Prime Minister to continue to pursue that - and, of course, it results in more jobs for more Australians. The exports into that region of the world that have been developed by these linkages have obviously played into the development and the growth of the one million jobs that have been created in Australia since 1996.</DOC>

 - I think I said in relation to the last question that the excise applied from Tuesday of last week. In fact, it applies from Tuesday of this week - that is, midnight tonight, 17 September. I table the Prime Minister's press release in relation to that matter. Obviously where you have petrol which is excised at 38c a litre, and where you can substitute some of that petrol with ethanol -  - you can bring down the price at the bowser by substituting a non-taxed product for a taxed one. That is why the government has introduced a 38c excise in relation to ethanol because it is a substitutable product -  - and it can be blended into petrol at the bowser. As I indicated earlier, whilst that is available as a loophole, you would expect people to take advantage of it. The government has moved to close down that loophole by indicating that from midnight tonight there will be a 38c excise - the same excise in relation to ethanol as there is in relation to petrol. As for the production subsidies, they are production subsidies which are designed to facilitate the domestic industry -  - which produces ethanol. The government has indicated that it will be looking at a production subsidy to stimulate the local industry as opposed to the international industry. - The hairy-chested Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that's weak. - Okay, she says, `It's wheat' - I withdraw then, Mr Speaker. I think most people would support the stimulation for the domestic industry. They would consider it to be advisable to put the domestic industry into a place where it could develop the capacity, as opposed to allowing that totally to come from overseas. That is the reasoning behind the government's decision. I think it is defensible on those grounds.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dixon for his interest in this subject. On that note, I also thank the member for Dobell, who has taken a major part in disseminating information about the meningococcal vaccine to his colleagues and to parents and families of children throughout Australia. It is every parent's nightmare that their child might unknowingly contract meningococcal. Indeed, the group C of the disease causes 60 per cent of the deaths that occur in this country. Accordingly, the Howard government has announced the funding of a national meningococcal C vaccine program, which will commence at the beginning of next year at an initial cost of some $41 million in the first year. Initially this free vaccine will be made available to three key at-risk groups affected by the disease: firstly, 12-month-old children as part of their routine vaccination program; secondly, 15-year-old adolescents also as part of the routine vaccination program; and, thirdly, a catch up dose for 16- and 17-year-olds in the first year of the program. We expect that over one million young Australians will be vaccinated against this infection in the first year.Members may be aware of some recent media reports that announced the approval of a new vaccine, which is hoped to ease the national shortage of this product on the private market. Until recently there had only been one registered provider in Australia, and the coming on line of this new provider and the third meningococcal C vaccine means that additional supplies are now arriving in this country. It means that there should be sufficient supplies both for the program which I have outlined and for parents who wish to provide a vaccination against this disease for children who are outside the confines of the program, which covers 12-month-old children and 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds.The vaccination program for children and infants in Australia is one of the quite real achievements of this government. When we came to power the levels of childhood immunisation were at Third World country levels in many respects. Today we have around 90 per cent of children aged between 12 and 18 months being immunised against a range of diseases. I think this gives quiet assurance to more Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I welcome the implicit acknowledgment in the Leader of the Opposition's question - and it is a very important acknowledgment - that what Iraq did yesterday was only the first step along a very long road. I welcome that. If it is possible for there to be agreement on that issue between the government and the opposition, then that is something I would not seek to deny.I have had an opportunity to further analyse, with due respect, the letter from the Iraqi foreign minister as well as the Leader of the Opposition's speech. I will say something about the former, and I may say something about the latter as well. I have analysed Iraq's announcement to readmit UN weapons inspectors. I think a number of things need to be said. The government believes that the Security Council needs to respond quickly and firmly to Iraq's offer to allow the return of UN weapons inspectors without conditions. Iraq's willingness to cooperate fully with UN disarmament processes needs to be tested as soon as possible. I think it is reasonable for the international community to be very sceptical indeed, given Iraq's record so far of defiance of the mandatory resolutions of the Security Council.It should be recalled that no UN inspections have taken place since 1998 and Iraq systematically worked to frustrate UN disarmament efforts before then. I do not at this stage want to commit myself - and I do not think anybody should commit themselves - to one, two or indeed more resolutions. I think there is value in a further Security Council resolution to maintain pressure on Iraq to meet its UN requirements, and I think it is essential that the Security Council now demonstrate a unity of purpose and resolve. Iraq's letter of 16 September offering resumption of inspections contains a number of very significant gaps. There was no undertaking to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions. There was no commitment to allow inspectors full and unfettered access. There was no commitment to disarm, which would include full disclosure of its illegal weapons of mass destruction programs. The onus in this matter is not on the United States, as some have asserted in the debate. The onus is very firmly on Iraq to fulfil its longstanding international obligations by providing full and unfettered access to UN inspectors, disclosing prohibited weapons of mass destruction programs and, crucially, ensuring complete weapons of mass destruction disarmament.Iraq's letter has provided some very limited scope for progress. I would not put it any more strongly than that. I think anybody anywhere in the world who puts it more strongly than that is deluding themselves. It provides limited hope; no more than that. For that reason, I think there is still a very strong onus on countries such as Australia to press the sort of approach that I have outlined in this question, which we will do. The President of Iraq needs to do much more before the international community can be satisfied that weapons of mass destruction disarmament obligations have been met. Australia will continue to support all efforts by the Security Council to deal firmly with the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.Let me say very seriously and very genuinely that to the extent that there can be a measure of bipartisanship on this issue, I want to achieve that. We are dealing with serious matters. There is a range of views in this parliament, and it is self-evident from the debate that that is the case. We are dealing at the moment with what I regard as nothing more than a diplomatic ploy by Iraq to try and shift the diplomatic initiative away from the United States and others and in Iraq's favour. I think we have to test that by doing the sorts of things that I have talked about in my answer. That is the response of the government. It is better that we have that Iraqi response because it indicates that without that pressure being applied to Iraq - let me say at the initiative overwhelmingly of the United States and not through the initiative, unaided by the United States, of the Security Council - we would not have had any initiative from Iraq, because we have had four years of blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council by Iraq.Those are the views of the government. It remains a very difficult issue. We will continue, as we have to date, to keep the opposition properly informed in relation to those matters where the opposition should be informed. To the extent that it is possible, consistent with the views we hold on this issue and the views that I respect and are held by those opposite, if we can achieve a degree of partisanship then that is something I will seek to achieve.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Prime Minister has already dealt substantively with the question of Security Council resolutions and the way that this issue needs to be taken forward over the next few days and weeks. There is no doubt, though, that this issue needs to be addressed with the greatest seriousness by the Security Council. In saying that, it is not the government's view that the letter that has been received by the Secretary-General from the foreign minister of Iraq giving a commitment to allowing UN inspections is the end of the matter and that the Security Council no longer needs to address this question. The Security Council does need to address the question and it will do so in the very near future. The letter allows for the return of inspectors without conditions but does not say that the inspectors will be able to do their work without conditions. The letter is also silent on a number of critical aspects - what it does not say is very significant. What it does not say is that Iraq will fulfil its Security Council resolution obligations. What it does not say is that Iraq will provide full and unfettered access to inspectors. What it does not say is that Iraq will disclose prohibited programs and what it does not say is that Iraq will disarm its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's letter raises the real prospect of a protracted negotiation over the terms of its compliance on the weapons of mass destruction provisions of Security Council resolutions. So the letter, whilst an important first step and something that both sides of the House have said they see as a constructive initial step, must be understood as only that - nothing more than an initial step. In answer to the honourable member's question, it is very important that the House and the broader community understand the reservations we have about this letter. Australia certainly does not want to overstate the importance of the letter. On the other hand, we do not want to dismiss its significance either. This is reflected very much in some of the international responses to the letter. Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary - by any measure, a very able man - has said:Iraq has a long history of playing games. People are bound to be sceptical. This apparent offer to allow weapons inspectors to return `without conditions' comes only four days after Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister said precisely the opposite.That is something that needs to be considered very carefully. Richard Butler - who I know is well known to many members of this parliament, particularly on the other side of the House - the former head of UNSCOM, wrote today in an article, `Iraq's letter to the UN did not pledge that inspectors can inspect without conditions. It only promised their admission without conditions.'The United States response to the letter is well known. Australia will continue to support the endeavours of the Security Council to deal firmly with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program. The onus remains squarely on Iraq to fulfil its international obligations, to provide full and unfettered access to inspectors, to disclose prohibited programs and to disarm. Saddam Hussein must not be given room to move on these issues.</DOC>

 - This would be a statement I could identify with in answer to that question: `The world would be a much better place without Saddam Hussein and his regime.' They are the words of the member for Canberra in the debate yesterday. - The member for Fraser; I apologise. I agree with those words and I agreed with those words back in March - I think it was.  - Let the debate go on and have a discussion about it. Do not continually interject. I think it was precisely the point that the member for Fraser made yesterday that I was making back in March, when the honourable member quoted me. This government has always been of the view that Iraq and the international community would be better off if the regime in Iraq were to change. There is no question of that. If you were to ask me, though, a different question - is there an international legal basis or bases for regime change? - the answer would be that there is no Security Council res-olution which authorises regime change. The Security Council resolutions entirely focus on the ultimate goal of the disarmament of the regime of Saddam Hussein. But that is not to detract from the fact that we think the security situation would be substantially better if it were not for the regime of Saddam Hussein.I have answered this question on many occasions and have said that the Australian government's principal objective here - well-founded on international law - is that Iraq should be required to disarm, consistent with Security Council resolutions, and to allow inspectors into Iraq in order to facilitate that disarmament process. The Security Council resolution does not require regime change and we have never claimed that it does. I did not, in my statement in March; the member for Fraser did not, in the statement that he made yesterday. There is absolutely no contradiction between the statements made by the member for Fraser and me, and the international legal situation, which is that the ultimate objective of this exercise first and foremost is disarmament. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I want to acknowledge the work that he has done as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and I acknowledge the report that he released today, called A review of independent auditing by registered company auditors. I have had the chance to read it, quickly, and it is a good read. It is a very positive and constructive addition to the work on this subject. Today the government has released its ninth proposal in relation to the economic reform of corporate law, and this is on strengthening the financial reporting framework.It has been acknowledged by the opposition that Australia's corporate law is better than that of the United States and in fact is probably one of the leading regimes, in terms of corporate regulation, in the world. But it is also important that we continue to work on it. CLERP1 to CLERP6 made great inroads and CLERP9 is the latest instalment for strengthening the financial reporting framework. We have put these proposals out and will take public comment until November of this year. We will prepare legislation from early next year. We will have the opportunity, if anything unexpected comes out of the HIH royal commission, to amend the legislation before putting it to the parliament in early 2003. We make a number of important recommendations in this CLERP paper to enhance corporate financial disclosure. For example, we propose to have the Financial Reporting Council oversee the auditing profession and to give auditing standards the force of the law; to make it mandatory for the top 500 companies to have separate audit committees; to make audit partner rotation compulsory after five years; to require audit committees to certify that the receipt of non-audit services did not comprise audit independence; to increase penalties in relation to contravention of continuous disclosure; to give ASIC the power to give on-the-spot infringement notices to those corporations that have breached continuous disclosure; to enhance analysts' independence; and to give protection against retaliation for employees who report contravention of corporate law to ASIC. These are welcome additions to Australia's Corporations Law, and the proposals which have been released today have been warmly welcomed. The Australian Stock Exchange has put out a statement entitled `ASX welcomes government Corporate Law reforms', which says:The government's initiatives ... provide a transparent and practicable framework for Australia's publicly listed companies. ... The reforms should help protect the interests of investors. ... 'The recommendations represent a sound and considered response to the investment community's concerns. ...'The Australian Securities Commission has put out a statement today, welcoming the release of this paper:`This is a comprehensive document that has positive proposals for reform,' Mr Knott - the chairman - said.I pay tribute to the work of Senator Ian Campbell, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who has worked so hard on this and to his predecessor, Minister Hockey, the former Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, for all the work that he has done. This takes Australia's corporate law reform another step forward. It puts us at the forefront of international practice. It will add to disclosure and help confidence from the public in investing in Australian companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that the Australian Industry Group survey of manufacturing today showed manufacturing business conditions remained solid in the September quarter, although a little below the strong result recorded in June. A net balance of 21 per cent of firms reported increased sales in the September quarter, down from 29 per cent in June, but this is a result which is very strong by historical standards. A net balance of 19 per cent of firms reported increasing investment in plant and equipment - that is, the number that report an increase less the number that report a decrease is a 19 per cent positive - which is a good sign for investment in the Australian economy. The NAB monthly business survey released last week showed that their business conditions index had strengthened, up 14 points in August. And the Westpac consumer sentiment survey, which was released last week, showed that consumer sentiment rose by 2.7 per cent. So consumers are feeling quite confident and sentiment is moving up, which is also a good indication. But there is no room for complacency. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of economic activity, which was released today, showed a fall in relation to the leading index. That is not a measure of where the economy is now; it is a measure of where the economy will be in the months which are to come. In particular, that leading index turned down because of movements in the share price index, which is down, and lower residential building approvals. Plainly, the effect of international stock markets will be having an effect on Australian activity. We saw again falls overnight on Wall Street. The much awaited US recovery from recession does not appear to have been as strong as many people hoped, and of course the US is the engine of world growth.There is no room for complacency. Australia continues to be the economy which grows strongest amongst the developed economies of the world, but it is a weak and sluggish world, particularly with the US just emerging from recession and Japan contracting and Europe very weak. It is important that we continue good economic management. That is what got us through the Asian financial crisis; that is what got us through the US recession.The important reforms which we still have to do are the reforms in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which the Labor Party could turn around and support, and the reforms in relation to unfair dismissals. Nothing would help the small business community in Australia more than passing the government's changes to the unfair dismissal laws. Why can't we get off the backs of small business and give them a bit of a go? I think the Labor Party can now look the union movement in the eye and say, `We tried, but we will relent in the interests of Australia.' Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if Labor put Australia's interests above the interests of the trade union movement. That would be a great thing for small business. The reforms need to keep going in relation to unfair dismissals, in relation to pharmaceutical benefits, in relation to all of the economic hard work which the coalition government has put in place and wants to continue. That will result in better job opportunities for Australians. One million jobs have been created since the government came to office in March 1996. Australians want job opportunities, and it is good economic management which is required to keep our economy growing so that it can create them.</DOC>

 - My advice is that the measures will not have that effect. The measures announced by the minister yesterday are designed to provide, as we foreshadowed, some additional flexibility in relation to the family tax benefit system, which provides an additional $2 billion a year to Australian families. It pays out, on average, $5,700 a year to Australian families in tax-free family tax benefits. That is an average of $5,700 a year. More than 260,000 families under this scheme get more than $10,000 a year tax free in fortnightly family payments. That is the dimension of the scheme that was brought in - incidentally, opposed by the Labor Party.  - You voted against the tax system of which it was an integral part. - Apparently it is all right -  - The new measures - which, on the advice available to the government, will not require legislation - will be phased in from November. They will give families more choices to help them reduce the likelihood of an overpayment. Families who tell us that their income has risen during the year will be able to be paid at a subsequent rate that reduces or wipes out a potential overpayment. Families will also be given the choice to receive some of their family tax benefit and child-care benefit during the year and the balance at the end. For example, families will be able to take the family tax benefit part A - that is, the one generally available whether you are a one- or two-income family with children - fortnightly, and FTB part B, which is designed specifically to help single income families, as a lump sum.This particular change addresses the problem that we acknowledge was being encountered by some single income families where the mother or father who was previously at home re-entered the work force and, because of the change in that person's financial circumstances, the impact of that over a year on the previously paid benefit meant that there was some debt owed to the government at the end of the year. Those families could also defer their FTB part A payments for older teenagers until the end of the year. Once again this helps families with children who might get a job during the year. These changes will also allow such families to get the base rate of FTB part A fortnightly and the rest of their entitlement as a lump sum at the end of the year. Once again this helps families in the FTB part A taper zone who are unsure of their annual income. These changes will also simplify their child-care benefit calculations so that they have a smaller buffer at the end of the year.The principle of this scheme is designed to assist Australian families subject to the income tests that were laid down when the measures were brought in. It is inevitable when you have a scheme which is based on entitlement according to an annual income that there will be some adjustments through the year as the level of a person's income either falls or rises, and no amount of change - unless you completely go away from such an annual income testing system which could involve vastly additional outlays to the government - will eliminate that entirely. We hold to the view that if somebody has been overpaid during the year they ought to, at the end of the year on reconciliation, have to pay it back. If they are underpaid during the year then we think they are entitled to a top-up. These changes will provide people with additional options that will reduce the number of cases where that is likely to occur. They particularly address the situation where a person notifies a change of income - namely, an increase during the year - but, because the subsequent payments during the unexpired residue of the year do not relate to the payments that were made prior to the notification, they still end up with a debit. What these changes will do is eliminate that, and I think they will be widely welcomed by Australian families. I think the other thing they will do is, if you are getting family tax A and family tax B, you will have the option of taking one of them - probably A - on a fortnightly basis, and taking family tax B on an annual basis. You will not be compelled to do that, and if people still want to continue to get the amount of money to which they are technically entitled on a fortnightly basis under the legislation and run the risk of a debit at the end of the year they are free to do that as well. In other words, multiple choices have been offered.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I should indicate to the House that the government's compulsory union fees bill is a sign of our total determination to uphold the freedom of association principles. Conversely, Labor's attitude to that bill seems to indicate the opposition's determination to protect the closed shop by encouraging these compulsory union levies. Let me say to the House that this government supports ordinary workers and their right to join or not to join a trade union. Conversely, the opposition supports the union bosses and their desire to impose a form of industrial conscription on unwilling workers. I can fully understand union officials' dismay at the collapse in union membership from over 50 per cent to under 25 per cent of the work force. In fact, with a membership rate of 25 per cent and falling, it sort of mirrors the approval rating of the Leader of the Opposition.What you cannot do is to try to gain by coercion what you have been unable to achieve by persuasion. Unfortunately, there are still too many members opposite who seem far more interested in and concerned with the welfare and the jobs of union officials than they are with the welfare and the jobs of ordinary workers. For instance, in the Senate we had Senator George Campbell describing the government's attempts to protect freedom of association as Orwellian. He would say that, wouldn't he, as a former general secretary of the AMWU, which has given $3 million over the last six years to the Labor Party.Senator Hutchins described freedom of association as ideologically driven. He is the former New South Wales Secretary of the TWU, which has given $1.6 million to the Labor Party. Senator Hogg described freedom of association as unAustralian. He is the former Queensland Secretary of the Shop Assistants Union, which has given $4 million to the Labor Party over the last six years. Senator Ludwig, who is the ultimate hereditary peer of the Labor Party, described freedom of association as being out of step with society - out of step with dad, more likely. The AWU has given $2.9 million to the Labor Party over the last six years. Labor's support for compulsory unionism is not going to change because union control of the Labor Party is not going to change.  - Mr Speaker, as you say, I was asked about the compulsory union fees bill which this government has introduced and will introduce again, and which members opposite are opposing because they are completely under the thumb of the union bosses. That is not going to change, and moving from 60-40 to 50-50 is just going to replace a majority shareholding with a controlling shareholding. - What the debate over the compulsory union fees bill has demonstrated absolutely clearly to the Australian people is that all that stands between the Australian people and a $500 a year union tax imposed on up to six million non-union members is the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I will be fascinated to hear, if the honourable member wants to inform me after question time, of the basis on which that claim is made. It is not our understanding of the effect of the change. What the change does is tackle one of the very things that you were talking about, and that is a situation where, if a person's income goes up during the year, under the previous interpretation of the law that was applied by the department, you had no alternative other than to keep being paid at a rate that did not recapture the overpayment prior to the notification of the increase. What we are now doing is giving you an option so that that will be eliminated. I am at a loss to understand how the honourable member asserts that that in some way produces the result that she has described or, indeed, the result described by the member for Lilley.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that there have been further statements of support for the Howard government's decision not to ratify the Kyoto protocol under the present circumstances to protect Australian jobs. Yesterday I noted Queensland Premier Peter Beattie's support for the federal government's position on the ground that actually ratifying the protocol would cost jobs in Queensland. The House will remember that when a journalist challenged Peter Beattie by saying, `That is what John Howard is arguing as well,' Mr Beattie replied, `Well, it's true. I am just telling the truth.'Today, in that very informative paper, the Financial Review, we have another statement by another well-known Australian who said, `I am not happy about the Commonwealth just signing up.' Who said that? It was none other than Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia. That statement is very significant because it directly contradicts the mantra that has been coming from the Leader of the Opposition that Australia should sign up now; not when it might be in our interest to sign up, not when we could sign up on a level playing field that might protect Australian jobs and industries, but sign up now. Just yesterday, the shadow minister put out a press release saying the Howard government must ratify the Kyoto protocol now. This utter neglect of the real implications of ratification for Australian jobs and industry was obviously too much for the Western Australian Premier. He went quickly to put his views on the record, and his response was reported in the press this morning. He was crystal clear about his position. He said: 'My position is that we should aspire to it but we shouldn't sign it until all of the states and territories have been properly involved in the process so we're not disadvantaged in WA.'I'm not happy about the Commonwealth just signing up ... - The Leader of the Opposition and his shadow minister are perfectly happy to join up now, but the Premier of Western Australia is not because he and some of his other state colleagues have actually thought through the issue. They actually care about jobs and opportunities in their states, while the Leader of the Opposition is happy just to barrack, to opportunistically tag along in the Kyoto conga line behind a few lobby groups. Premier Gallop and Premier Beattie know that it would be foolish to sign up to the protocol now, when that would give the message to companies looking at long-term investments that they would be suffering penalties and burdens in Australia that they would not be suffering if they invested in other countries.It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition's years as shadow Treasurer taught him nothing. We now have first-class analysis which shows the contraction to GNP that would occur if we signed up to the protocol, and yet the Leader of the Opposition seems not to understand that a contraction in GNP would mean a contraction in jobs. He ignores the results of the research on the public record, he has done none of the heavy lifting that is necessary to write policy, he has no thoughts of his own. All he does is tag along behind the vested interests that support the Labor Party. He has not consulted with the states. He has managed to succeed in dividing the Labor Party on this issue. Some leadership! His party is now falling to pieces behind him because he has not been able to think through a sensible, rational position. The government are setting out on a strategy which will achieve the Kyoto target. We are consulting with industry, we are consulting with the states and we are taking a responsible position in the international community.We know Labor's approach to greenhouse because we have seen it before: if there is a treaty, sign it. It does not matter if it penalises industry and it does not matter if it exports jobs from Australia. The Howard government and the people of Australia are not going to stand for this. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes; I do recall those earlier statements not only on Mr Jones's program but indeed on many other programs. We have had a look at this and we have introduced some more flexibility. After the rather extraordinary question asked by the member for Lilley - when I thought maybe I had been in another parliament - I had another look at the minister's statement. The minister's statement makes it very clear what we are doing. What we are doing is dealing with this - as I indicated this in my answer - with effect from November this year. I would remind the honourable member that, in the first year that this scheme was introduced, we gave people who had been overpaid money a grace amount of $1,000. - Can I say to the member opposite that that decision by the government was widely applauded throughout the Australian community. Many colleagues who sit behind me know that it was very warmly applauded. It was seen as yet another element of the government's pro-family policies. The government has introduced the flexibility that I promised, and those changes will be phased in. People who enjoy an increase in their salary and who notify it will have the option - they will not be compelled - of adjusting their future payments so as to not only reflect their slightly reduced entitlement for the unexpired portion of the year but also recapture the overpayments during the expired portion of the year. That will avoid the lump sum obligation at the end of the year, which is the option that I think people ought to have. The member for Lilley was talking about people deliberately overstating their income. We are not asking people to overstate their income. Under these changes, we are simply giving people the option. -  - We get these guffaws from those who sit opposite. I suppose, if you do not have any policies, you have to rummage around in your opponents' press releases and try to develop some fantasies out of those. It is a very simple, additional piece of flexibility. It will mean that, if you enjoy an increase and you notify, you will have the option of adjusting your future payments so there is no lump sum at the end of the year. If you do not want to do that, you do not have to, and then you will have the lump sum at the end of the year.Equally, I remind the House that there are a lot of people who are underpaid during the year. Of those who have adjustments, about six out of 10 are overpayments and about four out of 10 are underpayments. These changes will reduce the six out of 10 to something in the order of two or three out of 10. The people who have been underpaid will still get the top-up at the end of the year. It does not alter the fact that the average payment under this you-beaut scheme that the Labor Party opposed is $5,700 per family per year and that more than 260,000 Australian families get $10,000 a year tax-free on a fortnightly basis under this very generous, and very much needed, family tax benefit scheme. It is one of the signature programs of the last 6½ years. It has done a great deal to address the unfairness that we inherited in the Australian taxation system for people on low incomes. We inherited an enormous bias against families with young children in the Australian taxation system. -  - You must wander around your electorates with your hands over your ears if you think that the Australian public thought the tax system you left us was fair to families with children. It was plainly an unfriendly tax system to Australian families, and we have massively increased the tax benefits for Australian families. If we can do more, we will - in a fiscally responsible fashion - because when it comes to decent family tax policy it is the Liberal and National parties that have delivered to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question and recognise his particular interest in the River Murray and its health. The River Murray is a vital lifeline for much of rural and regional Australia. It is responsible for a significant proportion of the production of Australia's food and fibre, it is vital for the water supplies of a large number of urban communities and it is a very important recreational area for many Australians. The drought has had a number of serious effects on rural Australia, and amongst them has been the reduction in water flows in this great river system. As a result, there has been very little flow to the mouth of the Murray now for a considerable period of time, and there have been no releases of water to the Murray mouth since November last year. With the continuing dry conditions, it is fairly unlikely that there will be any capacity to release flows for that purpose for some significant time.The Murray-Darling Basin Commission therefore made a decision yesterday to proceed with a major program to dredge the mouth of the River Murray to make sure that it stays open, to preserve the precious environmental values of that region and to ensure that the tourism and other industries in that region are able to survive these dry times. The commission has pledged up to $2 million to be made available for this work. It is, of course, a very important initiative. The reasons why the mouth closes are quite complex, and clearly the build-up of sand in that area is an issue that will need to be dealt with more substantially in the longer term. This will, at least in the short term, ensure that the magnificent values of the Coorong wetlands are preserved and protected and that the health of that whole system can be sustained for the years ahead.I commend the Murray-Darling Basin Commission on this decision. I appreciate that people would prefer that this sort of action was not necessary, but when we deal with extraordinarily dry times it is inevitable that special and emergency action needs to be taken. We are intervening at this early stage to avoid the damages that could otherwise be caused and that has occurred on some previous occasions when the mouth has been closed. This intervention should help preserve the health of that region and the welfare of the honourable member's constituents. </DOC>

 - The point that I was making yesterday was that ethanol could be mixed with petrol and sold from a petrol bowser. Whilst you can put ethanol into a petrol bowser and whilst in that bowser the petrol which is being sold is taxed at 38c, you obviously have the opportunity to take advantage of the tax concession by switching ethanol for the petrol. That was the point that I made. - It is a much better system to have a watertight system so that whatever the mix -  - Mr Speaker, I am flattered by the warm reception he gives me at the dispatch box. -  - He's got us again! - As I was saying earlier, we have the capacity to put ethanol in a petrol bowser, where the petrol is taxable at 38c -  - You have the opportunity to switch some petrol with ethanol and take advantage of the 38c reduction in the tax rate. Where you have a situation where ethanol is taxed at 38c - the same as petrol, regardless of the mix - then inspectors who look at the petrol bowser know that the full volume, whether it is ethanol or whether it is petrol, has to be taxed at 38c. This means that you do not have entering into the consumer market the non-taxed, substitutable product. LPG is different in this sense, in that it does not go into petrol bowsers. You cannot mix LPG in with petrol at a petrol bowser. You cannot pump LPG from a petrol bowser. - Actually, it is right. As it turns out, you cannot actually put LPG -  - You cannot actually put LPG into a mix with petrol and pump it from a petrol bowser, so you do not have that problem with substitutability. If I could use an analogy, it is like the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. Once upon a time, those people who were not subject to excise could actually get their fuel excise free. What that meant was that in the retail market there was considerable leakage - that is, a person who might have been entitled to a concession could take it and could then on-sell it. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, which was introduced by the Labor Party, I think, and which we support, applied the excise to all of the product entering the market - so you had a watertight system from the consumers' point of view - and then gave the rebate back as a matter of policy.  The fact that you do a rebate means that there is, we can see, some more paperwork. But it means that you have a watertight system against leakage into the consumer market; so too with ethanol. If you want to actually apply the benefit to the Australian producer, you do it by way of a production back whilst you have a watertight system from the bowser in relation to the market. I think this is actually a good thing because it will aid enforcement by tax office officials and reduce the opportunity to take advantage of a tax concession in order to sell a product and take advantage of cheaper prices. That is what I said yesterday, and that is what I say today. I think, on a moment's reflection, that the member for Hunter is a fair man. I think, on a moment's reflection, that he will actually come around to seeing the wisdom of this decision. We often have this frustration: we have this sort of clipping around the edges from the Labor Party but they do not actually ever tell us what their policy is. If the Labor Party's policy is to take that off ethanol, we would like to know. It is the same in relation to the sugar levy. The shadow Treasurer announced at one o'clock that they were against the sugar levy and then at three o'clock announced that they were in favour of it, according to AAP. It went up on the AAP wire. - It is part of the ethanol policy. According to AAP, at 1.04 p.m., `Labor will oppose sugar levy: McMullan'. - According to AAP, at 3.04 p.m., two hours later, `a spokesman for Mr McMullan said Labor may have to support the levy'.  - I have explained fully the reasons why having an excise with a production subsidy will prevent leakage into the retail market. I have also indicated that, if the opposition opposes that policy, we would like to know. All we get from the opposition is these `mcmuddled' statements which change by the hour. If the opposition can see its way through another `mcmuddle' that it has got itself into, we would be very interested to know.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Canning for his ongoing interest in small business. He is a serial questioner in this House on small business and asks good questions about the level of taxation. As the Prime Minister said a little earlier in relation to family tax, when we came into government in 1996 we inherited a tax system that clearly disadvantaged Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. That is one of the reasons why we - despite the opposition of the Labor Party - reduced company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, halved capital gains tax, reduced personal income tax so that 80 per cent of Australians pay no more than 30c in the dollar, reduced excise taxes and abolished a whole range of other insidious little taxes such as FID and stamp duty on the transfer of shares. We did all that, to the benefit of Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. That is just one of the reasons why, in the 12 months after the introduction of the new tax system, thousands of new small businesses were created in Australia.The member for Canning asked me whether there are any alternative approaches. It has become quite clear, not only during this question time but during other question times, that the Labor Party has no solid stance in relation to taxation - that is, the Labor Party here in the Commonwealth. But, of course, the Labor Party in Western Australia has a different view, as the member for Canning would know. In a grievance debate in the state parliament last Thursday, the Labor member for Perth, John Hyde, stood up to criticise -  - He has left films. - It was not me; blame him. - He stood up in the Western Australian parliament on Thursday and criticised the Western Australian Labor government, of which he is a member, for introducing the highest rent taxation in Australia. In fact, as it stands, the Western Australian state government charges small businesses that rent out equipment, with a threshold of $24,000 a year, 1.8c in every 100c of rentals. That is, if you have got a party hire company that is renting out glasses at 30c for each glass -  - You should not laugh about parties; the unions have hired the Labor Party for the last 100 years.Government member - They have owned it. - They have owned it; it was a lease-back. If you have a party hire business and you are renting out glasses, you are charging your customers a state stamp duty on every glass rented out. In Western Australia, it is 1.8 per cent of the total take in relation to that - the highest in Australia. This member, John Hyde, criticised that. He said:A transaction as small as the hiring out of a dozen ... wine glasses ... for 30c each attracts stamp duty. He called upon the state treasurer, Mr Eric Ripper -  -  - No-one likes state treasurers. Not even Carl Scully likes state treasurers, does he? - No-one likes state treasurers, especially if they are Labor. But the bottom line is that Mr Ripper has conceded that the compliance costs associated with the rental stamp duty were high. He goes on to say: That is not a reasonable way in which to raise taxation revenue.On this side of House, we had the courage to reform taxation. On this side of the House, we went to the Australian people and said, `We want a fairer taxation system not just for small business but for consumers.' It is about time the states had a bit of courage about reforming their taxation systems as well.</DOC>

 - The answer I gave yesterday was based upon recollection of personal contact with me. I cannot tell you, without checking, whether somebody in my office got a fax or a telephone call or read an AAP report. - I really do not know. - I will be very happy to have a look at whether there were any communications. I think I may have said yesterday that it would not surprise me if there had been communications from that company. Why not? This is a democracy, after all. Let me say that this idea that there is something criminal or sinister and that a company or a citizen who believes that an event is going to disadvantage them commercially has no right to put a view to the government of the day - this idea that if they do put that view it is a crime or something sinister or corrupt - is absolutely absurd. As far as I am concerned, the government is not going to conduct business on the basis that people who believe they have a case to put to the government and a request to make to the government are prevented from doing so because they are a successful Australian company. Of course I know Mr Honan. I can tell you that the first time I met him he told me how well he knew my predecessor, Mr Keating. But, of course, that does not make him bad or Mr Keating bad or me bad. I know a lot of business men and women around Australia. In fact, I think it is part of my job to know what the business community of Australia thinks, and I do not apologise for getting letters from people like Dick Honan.Just for the record, I have been informed by the Minister for Trade that the first time he heard about it was when a lobbyist for the company that was importing the ethanol from Brazil informed a senior member of the minister's staff at a Canberra function. I suppose we should have a criminal investigation into that as well. I will have a look. As far as I am concerned, I am quite happy to disclose to the House that I know Dick Honan. He is known to a lot of people in the parliament. He is known to a lot of people opposite. I know that and they know that I know it. I think this is absolutely ridiculous but, for the purposes of the record, I will check the faxes, I will check whether I have messages and I will also check the AAP wire - I will check it now and I will check it in two hours time as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. The seafood industry makes a major contribution to exports for the Australian economy, particularly in the electorate of Grey. The member for Grey is a strong supporter of the industry, and approximately two-thirds of South Australia's seafood industry comes from the Eyre Peninsula, which just happens to be in the electorate of Grey. Fourteen per cent of the work force of the Eyre Peninsula - 2,000 jobs - are engaged in that industry. Obviously members on both sides are aware that representatives from Australia's seafood industry were in Parliament House today promoting the wellbeing of their industry and telling us what they have been doing and what they are going to do in the future. I urge members from both sides of the House to engage in a discussion with the seafood industry. Last year, Australian exporters earned $154 billion for the Australian economy, and $1.7 billion of that was earned by the seafood industry: $500 million from fresh, chilled and frozen fish; $500 million from lobster; $300 million from prawns; and $400 million from shellfish. I might add that a lot of those shellfish come from my electorate and from the electorate of the member for Paterson. Excellent seafood exports come from that part of New South Wales. - Those that he does not eat before they leave. It is also interesting to note that we export $4.4 million worth of seafood to the Middle East. This week I have been explaining to the House the importance of our export effort and our market presence in countries in the Middle East, and this sector is specifically important. The member for Grey also asked about jobs and the significance of the jobs that are created in our economy by this industry. We have been hearing all week how, since 1996, with the efforts of this government, we have generated a million new jobs in the Australian economy. There are 19,000 Australians directly employed in the commercial fishing industry, and that has grown from a level of 13,000 in 1996. Since 1996, in the period that we have developed a million new jobs in the economy, there has been a 46 per cent increase in jobs in this industry. The Australian seafood export industry deserves the support not only of this parliament but also of the people of Australia, because it is obviously delivering, under the policies of this government, jobs, jobs, jobs. It is making its contribution to the development of those one million new jobs that have been created since 1996.</DOC>

 - I refer the shadow minister to the article by Professor Warrick McKibbin in this morning's Australian Financial Review where he made the point that he was appalled at the distortion of the analysis which I had tabled and put in the public domain last Friday. He was appalled at the distortion of this, particularly, of course, by the shadow minister and the Labor Party who refuse to acknowledge what Premier Beattie and Premier Gallop have now acknowledged - that this analysis would show that there would be serious job losses through contraction of the economy if the government were to sign the Kyoto protocol. So, it is quite clear that the opposition has failed to understand the analysis that has been put out and has been completely prepared to misrepresent this analysis in an outrageous way. There was no delay in putting out this analysis.  - The analysis was put out at the earliest possible moment, and the government is pleased to have it on the public record because it fully supports the case that the government has made: it would not be in Australia's interests to sign and ratify the Kyoto protocol at present.Let me make it quite clear, since I have the opportunity, that the government are working extremely hard to meet the Kyoto target that we negotiated. We have put a range of measures in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, the measures currently in place will reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by some 60 million tonnes a year. We are consulting with industry and the states to ensure that we put in place the remaining measures necessary to reach the Kyoto target. That is a totally different approach to that of the Labor Party. The Labor Party has not read the analysis, it has not consulted with industry and it has not consulted with the states or even with premiers who are members of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and her continuing interest in health and aged care in Australia. I welcome the report of the Review of Nursing Education, which was released earlier this week by my colleagues the minister for education and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson. I commend those who are responsible for this comprehensive report, in particular Mrs Patricia Heath, the chair of the task force that compiled the report. There are a series of recommendations in the report for Commonwealth, state and territory governments and also for the health sector. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that a number of the initiatives outlined in recommendations of the report, particularly in relation to aged care, are already being addressed by the government. These include the $211 million in additional recurrent funding, which was announced in this year's budget; the pricing review, which I referred to earlier in the week; an initiative worth $26.3 million designed to create 1,000 scholarships for nurses in Australia, particularly those who wish to go into or remain in the aged care sector; an additional $21.2 million for training aged care workers, personal care workers, particularly those in smaller homes in rural and remote Australia; and, in addition to that, the review of the paperwork burden for nurses in aged care. There is one other recommendation which I will address: a call for a nationally consistent framework to be developed that allows all nurses to work within a professional scope of practice, including the administration of medications by enrolled nurses. In this country, we have an absurd situation where, for example, in the state of Western Australia an enrolled nurse can give an insulin injection to a resident of a nursing home, whereas in every other state of Australia an enrolled nurse with the same qualifications is not permitted to give - is prohibited in fact - an insulin injection to a resident of a nursing home. Indeed, this is more bizarre because not only that enrolled nurse but anyone for that matter - any of us; a spouse of an elderly person living at home, for example, in receipt of a home and community care package or simply living at home, as the great majority of elderly Australians do - could receive an insulin injection from anybody else. So we have this bizarre, restrictive practice, so far as nursing is concerned, that enrolled nurses in most states of Australia cannot do something as simple as give an insulin injection to a resident of a nursing home. I noted and welcomed that in their press release welcoming the Review of Nursing Education, the Australian Nursing Federation said, `It is now time for all interested parties to work together in responding to the report's recommendations.' I call upon all state and territory health ministers, who are responsible for the legislation in this regard, to follow the recommendations of the report and to amend their legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his keen interest in the welfare of young people, as is the case for all members on this side of the House. I am delighted to inform the parliament that we have 50 quite exceptional young people from around Australia attending the Youth Roundtable, which I know many members have also attended. These young people come from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and from all around Australia. They have come to Canberra to deliver their papers on the projects that they have been focusing on over the last six months.Helena Bates and Justin Elks were two people from the Deakin electorate whom I met. Helena made a very significant contribution, `Beyond the smokescreen', in which she talked about the importance of discouraging young people from smoking. Many others also made significant contributions, including Ana Kosi, from Griffith, in the member for Riverina's electorate; Penny Dollin, from Brisbane, who is looking at the linkages in getting young people from university into the work force; and Brittany Noble, from the member for Page's electorate, who told a very moving story about how she contemplated suicide but found the strength to get through that. She made a very powerful presentation to the Youth Roundtable. Mohammed Isa Minkom from the Cocos islands, in the member for Lingiari's electorate, made a valuable contribution about more equal opportunities for those people in remote areas.The government takes the National Youth Roundtable very seriously. It takes on board the participants' suggestions and puts them into some sort of policy format. It provides the participants with an opportunity to display their story and their passion to the parliament. I would like to acknowledge all those members on this side of the House who have spent time at the National Youth Roundtable or who have met many of the participants. The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs is nodding, as is the Prime Minister. I would like to particularly acknowledge the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who was the principal driver behind establishing the Youth Roundtable a number of years ago. He attended many of the sessions, along with other cabinet ministers, including the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister.This demonstrates that the government is listening. I was a little perplexed by the comments of the member for Gellibrand on the ABC News just recently. I am glad that she did attend many of the workshops. I would have to say that she must be listening, because she was there all day taking down notes from these young people. However, she was the only person I noticed from the Labor Party, as opposed to the many senior cabinet ministers and others I saw from this side. Why was that so? It was because the Liberal-National Party have a genuine concern for the welfare of young people. We earn their respect. We do not take them for granted like the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is that I am not aware of that article. I am a fairly regular reader of the Daily Telegraph, and indeed other newspapers.An opposition member - It is a good newspaper. - It is a good newspaper, yes. I am not disputing that there was such an article but I am not personally aware of it. The advice that I have indicates that families will not lose entitlements to any ancillary benefits, but if they choose to forgo their whole FTBA entitlement until the end of the year, they will not receive rent assistance during the year, as this is paid as part of the total FTBA. They can, however, choose to continue to receive the amount equivalent to their rent assistance while deferring the rest of the FTBA entitlement. They will not lose access to an HCC, as this is linked to their entitlement to FTBA rather than to fortnightly receipt. Centrelink will, however, need to make system changes to ensure that an HCC is issued. - I am just telling the truth. They will not receive automatic access to an HCC, although they could claim an HCC separately, as a low-income household. So the claim I made yesterday is right.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I recognise the genuine interest she has shown in this issue over quite some period of time and her participation in debates, both here in the parliament and elsewhere, on this very important question. As both the Prime Minister and I said yesterday, in the House and elsewhere, Iraq has said it will admit inspectors unconditionally, but we do remain sceptical, given Iraq's history of dissembling and avoidance of its obligations. The government's policy is very clear: inspections should be unhindered, unfettered and under the terms of the existing United Nations Security Council resolutions. The UN must be allowed to fulfil its mandate for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction threat. But since the receipt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the letter from the Iraqi Foreign Minister, we have been following very closely the progress on preparations for inspection teams, should these inspections end up going ahead.The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which is known as UNMOVIC, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, are the two organisations which, in the event of inspections proceeding, will go into Iraq. Our Ambassador to the United Nations in New York, John Dauth, met on Tuesday with Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC. Dr Blix advised that his inspection team was ready to respond very quickly. They could get a preliminary logistics team into Iraq within a week and formal inspection teams could soon follow in the weeks after that, depending on how easy it is to organise the logistics. UNMOVIC has trained 320 inspectors and has worked through the documentary evidence it inherited from UNSCOM, as well as new material and assessments, to prepare for inspections on Iraq's biological and chemical weapons and missile capabilities. The IAEA's Iraq Action Team will focus on Iraq's nuclear activities and has prepared a plan for the resumption of inspections. Mr Blix held preliminary discussions on Tuesday with Iraqi officials on the practicalities for inspections, and more discussions are to take place with the Iraqis next week, in Vienna.I think members will know that Australia has a proud history of contributing to international disarmament and nonproliferation efforts. Honourable members may be interested to know that 110 Australians served with UNMOVIC's predecessor, UNSCOM, and we were the fourth-largest national contributor. Of course, we provided for some time the chair of UNSCOM, Richard Butler. Eighteen Australians have been trained as inspectors by UNMOVIC, and Australia is ready to participate in the resumption of IAEA weapons inspections as well. We have been in discussions recently with the IAEA on this. I do not think there is any doubt that Australians will play a significant role again in inspections, if those inspections take place. We are of course happy for our nationals to participate, given the great expertise they have in some of these technical areas.In conclusion, the question that is left hanging is the question of whether these inspections will go ahead at all. I thought I might conclude by reminding the House of some comments that Richard Butler - who is well known to members on the other side - the former chairman of UNSCOM, made on the 7.30 Report two nights ago. He said:... my worst fear is that Iraq will actually play the pea-and-thimble game, the pea-and-shell game again and that it will break down and there will be a war.We hope that that is not a prediction that turns out to be accurate, but it does remind us that people like Richard Butler have real concerns. He went on to say in relation to the letter from the Iraqi foreign minister:This letter from Iraq is good.It should be gone with but it's not complete.We don't know whether full access will be given on the ground.We urgently await quick responses from the Iraqis on the further questions that have been raised with them by the United Nations. We hope those answers can be provided, and provided consistent with Iraq's obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions. </DOC>

 - I would recommend to anybody that they not use fuel outside the manufacturers' warranties. If anybody is using fuel outside the manufacturers' warranties, not only will the warranties be void but they risk doing damage to their cars. And so we would recommend very strongly against the practice. I thank you for raising it. You give me the opportunity to reinforce the message. Thank you very much.</DOC>

 - Every year the IMF does an annual report - it is called an article IV Consultation - on the economies which are members of the IMF, which is nearly every economy of the world. Today, the article IV report was released on Australia. I can confirm to the House that the article IV report by the IMF finds that the Australian economic performance over recent years has been impressive and that, despite major external shocks, the impressive economic performance has continued. The IMF attributed this success to the Australian authorities' skilful economic management. I think most Australians will welcome that.The IMF commended the foundation established by sound economic policies sustained over the past several years, including fiscal consolidation, adoption of an inflation targeting framework, structural reforms in the product and labour markets, trade liberalisation and appropriate discretionary monetary and fiscal policy actions. The IMF also finds that, in the 2002 year, Australia will continue to be the strongest growing of the developed economies of the world, that inflation will be at the midpoint of our inflation targeted band, that our fiscal position is strong and that we now have a flexible economy which can cope with external shocks.I think it is worth while just remembering that these things do not happen by accident. It is the result of sustained economic work that our economy has been made flexible. It would not be, in this case, if we still were carrying $96 billion of Labor debt or if our budgets were haemorrhaging or if our inflation were high or if our mortgage interest rates were where they were under Labor Party administration. And, by way of comparison, let us go back 10 years, to 1991. I ask the House to compare the situation 10 years ago, in 1991. In that year, GDP - now projected to grow at 3¾ per cent - contracted by 1.1 per cent. In that year, 205,000 jobs were lost. In that year, the unemployment rate was 9.2 per cent. In that year, the home mortgage interest rate was 14 per cent. In that year, Paul Keating was the Treasurer, and in that year his assistant was Senator Bob McMullan. Writing in the Canberra Times on 5 May 1991, Senator McMullan said:I know that it's unfashionable to have anything positive to say about the Australian economy at present. However, last week I had the opportunity to represent Australia at meetings of the IMF and World Bank. Such occasions tend to put domestic concerns into perspective. We should never forget our relatively favourable situation. As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune.In 1991, the Labor Party compared Australia with Mali, Peru and Bangladesh in order to rejoice in our good fortune. These days we tend to compare ourselves with France or Germany or Britain or the United States. He said: As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune.Many members of the House will not remember but, after writing that article, former Senator Bob McMullan earned himself the nickname of Bob Mali - M-a-l-i. Different hairstyle, Mr Speaker!It indicates that things have turned around in Australia over the last 10 years. We have had stronger economic growth. It is the product of economic reform. That is why economic reform is important, and that is why the coalition intend to continue with good economic management.</DOC>

 - As I have said previously, anybody who uses a fuel which is outside a manufacturer's warranty or indemnity voids that warranty or indemnity, and I would recommend strongly against it. Secondly, anybody who passes off ethanol as petrol would engage in misleading and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act and, as a corporation, would be liable for fines of, I would think, up to $1 million. The Trade Practices Act has a provision which finds that any corporation engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct contravenes the Trade Practices Act and is liable for fines of up to $1 million. If there is any evidence that a corporation is trying to pass off ethanol as petrol we would be very interested in launching a prosecution. As far as the government are concerned, we recommend very strongly against the practice of voiding indemnities, and we would certainly recommend that nobody put ethanol above 10 per cent because they will be liable to prosecution and that nobody buy it because they will be liable to damage their car.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question and also for the opportunity to travel with him and the Deputy Prime Minister through much of his electorate last week to visit some of the people who are affected by serious drought in the electorate of Parkes. It is indeed tragic to see the way in which so many of those usually productive areas have been destocked. Crops have failed, and the potential for an income for many of those producers has been lost for another season. This government cares about farmers and the impact of serious seasonal conditions upon their livelihoods and has acted to provide relief and permanent programs that can support farmers who are facing difficult times, whether or not they are in a drought declared area, and especially to have in place arrangements to meet the exceptional needs that occur perhaps once in a lifetime in farmers' experiences.I am pleased to advise the House today that the government has announced some new measures to assist farmers who are facing very serious seasonal conditions. These new measures will apply to any exceptional circumstances applications that are lodged from today and also will include the application for the Bourke and Brewarrina region which the New South Wales government lodged a week or two ago. Under the new measures the government will be prepared to provide welfare assistance for a period of six months as soon as a prima facie case has been made to send an exceptional circumstances application to the National Rural Advisory Council. In other words, we will provide welfare benefits immediately the prima facie case is established, without waiting for the National Rural Advisory Council to consider the application in more detail. If the application succeeds, the benefits will continue for two years, as they do at the present time; if it fails, the benefits will end after six months. This will mean that farmers facing difficulty will have some immediate assistance so that they are able to address the daily need of putting food on their families' tables to get them through those difficult times. The EC criteria agreed between the Commonwealth and the states some years ago require that to be eligible for EC assistance a farmer must have suffered a severe income loss for a period of more than 12 months as a result of the exceptional seasonal event. Sometimes there are therefore long waiting periods as that 12-month period ticks by before an area can be effectively declared to be in exceptional circumstances, so the government has decided to use predictive modelling, where appropriate, to enable an application to be referred to the National Rural Advisory Council much earlier - as soon as we are satisfied that the criteria will be met in the months ahead. The government has also decided to apply these new criteria to the EC application for the Bourke and Brewarrina region, so, as a result, I have referred that application to the National Rural Advisory Council, the independent body that is designed to deal with these sorts of matters and make recommendations as to whether or not the area should be permanently declared to be in exceptional circumstances. As a result, welfare payments will be available to the eligible producers amongst the 471 farmers covered by that particular application, and they will be available immediately.This is a clear demonstration of this government's commitment to do what it possibly can to help make the exceptional circumstances arrangements work much better. These measures are in addition to the continuing assistance that we provide through programs such as Farm Help, through the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, through financial counsellors, FarmBis and a range of other programs that are available whether or not an area is in an exceptional circumstances declaration.It is well known to the House that I have been endeavouring to reform the EC arrangements for some time. I wanted the scheme to be more timely, to be fairer and to provide more generous assistance to farmers in need. Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago the Labor states got together and decided that they would gang up and block these reforms. They would refuse to deliver to farmers the benefits that they really need in times when circumstances are difficult. I am very disappointed about that approach; I am very disappointed that there is no concern for the needs of farmers. But I said at that time that, in spite of the intransigence of the states, we would do what we could to help make the existing arrangements work as well as they can. These announcements today are a clear commitment of our willingness to try to make a flawed system work as well as it can. But, if there is a state that is prepared to break ranks with this horrible deal that has been done, the federal government will stand ready to talk to them because we do not want the farmers in one state to be disadvantaged because of the lack of caring concern of Labor governments in other states. We want the system to be reformed, and to provide more timely and inclusive consultation with the community and more generous assistance to affected farmers. But we can only do that if there is a partnership with the states. Sadly, that has not been forthcoming. I condemn those states who show so little concern for the farmers of their region, but we have at least acted to do what we can to make the current arrangements work as well as possible.</DOC>

 - I am asked about some correspondence to the Prime Minister and Max Moore-Wilton. Obviously the proper people who would be in receipt of that would be the Prime Minister or Max Moore-Wilton. - As it turns out, I do not open their letters. -  - I am asked about correspondence to the Prime Minister and Mr Max Moore-Wilton -  - As it turns out, I do not receive their correspondence, so obviously I cannot comment on that. Does the government support use of ethanol above 10 per cent? No. There seems to be an assumption here that the government supports the use of more than 10 per cent ethanol. The answer is no. And we thank you for raising that in the parliament because it gives us the opportunity to say to people, `We don't recommend using more than 10 per cent ethanol.' What is more, we also say that anybody passing off should be subject to legal action, and we would be very happy to alert Professor Fels if there is evidence of that or if there is misleading or deceptive conduct.The letter that was tabled a moment ago was a letter to the minister for the environment, which I think was dated December 2001 - which is late last year - which, as far as I can read it, talks about the commission being represented on an ethanol task force managed by Environment Australia. One of the purposes of the task force is to determine an appropriate level of ethanol for regulation in the national fuel standards. We will certainly make inquires of that task force and of Environment Australia and see if there is a recommendation to move in relation to that. We would have no objection to doing it. I thank you for referring the letter to us. But, in the meantime, what we would say is this: we do not recommend that anybody breach the manufacturer's warranty. We recommend that if the Labor Party has any evidence of people passing off ethanol as petrol it be given either to us or to the ACCC, and we would be very happy to see a prosecution taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in improving transport outcomes in this country, particularly given some of the recent regional development projects in his area which are very dependent upon roads infrastructure if they are to maximise and optimise the investment and job outcomes for that part of Australia.I have said in this place before, and said elsewhere too, that Australia faces a very daunting task if it is to prepare its infrastructure for future transport needs. Transport is a vital enabler for the rest of the economy and, in its own right, the transport and logistics sector constitutes something like nine per cent of the national economy. With a doubling of our freight task and an increase in passenger movements of around 50 per cent expected over the next 18 years, it is incredibly important that we make certain that we plan our infrastructure carefully and consistently in the national interest to boost exports and to maximise interconnectivity between our major cities and regions. We have not been doing it well enough, frankly, as a nation, partly because it has been very hard for Australia to break free of the cross-jurisdictional issues.I am delighted to be able to say that our proposal, which has been named AusLink, for taking forward a national five- to 10-year rolling plan for infrastructure has now met with solid agreement from all of the states to work together collaboratively. This is a very welcome breakthrough. In fact, it has not happened for a very long time and, in relation to rail, it can be argued that it has never happened. In 2002, 101 years after Federation, we still do not have a truly seamless interstate rail freight track in Australia. We are working collaboratively, and I think we are going to be able to fix that with the New South Wales government with the substantial carrot from the Commonwealth of nearly $900 million in promised upgrades. Taking over a lease of the interstate track in New South Wales for a period of 60 years will enable us to drive forward what this country needs, and what the private freight and logistics sector in this country says is the most urgent need, in terms of transport infrastructure: an upgrading of east coast freight rail so that it can meet with demands into the future.I should note on the way through that, enthusiastic as I am about rail reform, with the exploding freight task before us, there will be enormous opportunities for the trucking industry - which has been and is very strongly supported by this government; tax reform has dramatically reduced the cost of trucking transport - and there will be more than enough for both sectors in the future.Yesterday, I met with the state ministers responsible for transport. I am delighted to again note that they are working collaboratively with us as we finalise a green paper. That will go out for comment, I hope, in early November, and the private sector, the states and local governments will then have a period of some months to comment on it. Towards the middle of next year I hope we can strike a new intergovernmental agreement which will set the country up for its long-term transport needs. This is a government which is looking not simply to the next election but also to the long-term needs of the nation, whether it has been with economic reform, whether it has been with the intergenerational considerations that the Treasurer has been leading or with important matters such as transport.I was asked whether there are any alternative policies. The truth is that I am having great difficulty working out whether there are or whether there are not, because my opposite number on this issue initially said that all I had done was steal Labor Party policy. He then moved to say it was not Labor Party policy. He is now saying, I think, that even though the state Labor colleagues agree that this is the best way forward, he does not agree with it. So I have to say that, at this stage, I cannot confirm whether there is an alternative policy or what it might be. </DOC>

 - The first part of the question had a false assertion, which does not make it true just because it was by the member for Fraser. As to the second part, of course there should not be misleading or deceptive conduct by any corporation. We have very stiff penalties in relation to that, and any evidence which the Labor Party wants to supply or which is otherwise available would be referred to the proper authorities.The member for Batman tabled a letter to Environment Australia which was dated 22 February 2002 on the question of ethanol above 10 per cent, which is certainly not recommended by the government. Obviously I am not responsible for Environment Australia but I am very happy to answer on its behalf. Environment Australia is completing a study of the barriers in the fuel market to the wider take-up of ethanol and biodiesel. The preliminary results of the study will be with the minister by the end of the year. The government is undertaking longer-term testing of vehicles to assess the impact of 20 per cent ethanol in petrol blend on the current Australian car fleet. These results will be available by June 2004.The government recognises the need to provide industry and motorists with reliable, high-quality fuels. The setting of a maximum level of ethanol that can safely be added to petrol and quality standards are important aspects, and this matter is being considered by Environment Australia to determine the appropriate level of the cap on ethanol. When Environment Australia considers that, I assume that through the national fuel standards regulations, which Environment Australia is responsible for, it will be acting.Although I am not the minister for Environment Australia, I have sought from the minister what in fact Environment Australia is doing and I am told that Environment Australia is getting ready to get all of those results and to act on the fuel standards accordingly. It seems to me that that is a pretty logical thing to do. In the meantime, what we would say is: do not void your warranties; and, if you have any evidence of misleading or deceptive conduct or passing off, we will be very happy to refer that to the appropriate authorities and to have a prosecution. We thank you for your questions because they give us the opportunity to underline to people: do not void your warranties; do not buy any petrol that has greater than 10 per cent ethanol. It is not something that has ever been recommended by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He is a great advocate of manufacturing in his electorate. I also congratulate him on his launch recently of the M:Tec project, funded by the Commonwealth government, which encourages young people to play a role in manufacturing and consider manufacturing as a career. It gives them exposure to the industry while they are still at school. As the figures yesterday show, manufacturing continues to be a strong contributor to the economic growth of Australia. This is particularly evident in some of the figures we have seen recently in the automotive industry. In fact, the latest ABS figures show a 4.1 per cent growth in motor vehicle sales in August, with sales 9.8 per cent higher than they were 12 months ago. I had the pleasure yesterday - as did the member for Rankin and many of my federal colleagues - of being at the launch of the new Camry, released by Toyota. It is a great example of Australian manufacturing: about 80 per cent local content and supported by some 100 local companies, some of which are in the member for Dunkley's electorate. Today we have Ford's new car, codenamed Barra, launched onto the market. This confirms that the industry is confident about its future, and it confirms that the $2.8 billion ACIS scheme introduced by this government is an outstanding success.I am asked about threats. I am not going to go back over all the threats that Dougie Cameron has for the car industry. But, in a general sense, in the manufacturing industry there are concerns about some of the attitudes from the unions, as well as those from Dougie. It is interesting to note that Leigh Hubbard was quoted on 12 August in Sky News as saying, `If we don't have militant unionism in the building industry, we don't have a union movement at all.' I would suggest that he is right on both counts - and you will not have a union movement, the way membership is falling right now. Comments like that explain why, under the Bracks government, 110 firms have left Victoria, shed staff or decided against investing. That has cost Victoria 21,000 jobs, and that is only a taste of what would happen if Labor were in power in the federal government. It explains why industry in Australia supports the Howard government so strongly.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. As to the government's policy on this issue, I think it has been admirably explained by the Treasurer in the course of answering a whole series of questions. I do not think I could have put it any better than he has; I think he put it very well. As to discussions that other people have that I am not a party to, obviously I do not have any knowledge of those discussions. - In relation to individual companies, nothing that has been done by me or by the government in this area has been designed to confer any benefit on a particular individual or a particular company. When governments take decisions that have an effect on revenue or involve the payment of consumer subsidies, some people inevitably derive benefits from those decisions more than others. That has been the case from time immemorial. The question is whether the right decisions have been taken.This is perhaps a good opportunity, seeing as the company Manildra was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, to answer the question that was directed to me yesterday by the member for Fraser. The member for Fraser asked me some questions about communications between Manildra and my office. In the time available, I have had a search made and this is the latest advice I have. I put it in that conditional sense because sometimes - as the member will know from his own experiences as a minister - you are not always given the full story right at the very beginning. Bits and pieces turn up later on, and you have to be careful. That is not said negatively; it is just a fact of life. The member asked me what communication my office had with Manildra relating to the decision to change excise arrangements for the ethanol industry. As I stated earlier, I had not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue. I have, on checking, found that a number of letters were received on this general issue - not just on ethanol but on the general issue. In fact, my office received 16 in all, from different sources, from January until now. Some of these dealt with the shipment from Brazil while others dealt with options to promote the ethanol industry more generally. My office did receive a letter from Mr Honan but that letter was not passed to me. I point out to you that I receive 2,400 letters a week and I have to say that not each of them is drawn personally to my attention. My office spoke to a number of parties about options for promoting the ethanol industry. Obviously, this included the Australian Biofuels Association, but it also involved people with a different view. This is a normal part of government when dealing with an issue like this. I point out that the decision on ethanol - that is, the decision to impose a full excise but also to have a subsidy - was taken as part of a number of decisions taken by the cabinet. It was a cabinet decision and it was taken as part of a range of measures affecting the sugar industry.Cabinet considered the sugar industry on a number of occasions, and ethanol was part of this. Cabinet made the decision in relation to not only ethanol but also other matters concerning the sugar industry. Cabinet made the decision based on a memorandum from a task force, which was prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in consultation with the Department of the Treasury; the Department of Finance and Administration; the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; the Department of the Environment and Heritage; the Department of Transport and Regional Services; the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations; the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources; the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Department of Family and Community Services; the Attorney-General's Department; and Customs.In other words, there was a proper process followed to take the decision. It was the right decision. I support the decision totally. It was not designed to confer a particular favour on Mr Honan at all, and any suggestion to that effect is strenuously repudiated by me and by members of the government. It was the right decision. It has been widely applauded, I might say, by the cane growers of Australia, and I think there are many members in this House who believe that this decision is in the interests of Australian industry. I make no apology for taking a decision which is consistent with this country's World Trade Organisation obligation and which is in the interests of Australian industry. What is happening is an attempt by the Labor Party to find fault with a decision that was manifestly beneficial to an Australian industry. I find it passing strange that you have the Australian Labor Party trying to undermine a decision that was taken in the interests of Australian industry. It was the right decision, it was properly taken and I have absolutely no compunction in supporting it 100 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Indeed, I have pleasure in informing the House that the latest development in terms of Australia's auto exports to the Middle East took place in Melbourne this morning. I had the honour of participating in a ceremony in Melbourne where a shipload of the current model Camrys was being loaded, bound for the Middle East. Our auto exports have dramatically increased in number since 1996, to the point where last year we sold $5 billion worth of auto exports to the world. The auto industry is well on target to achieve its goal of selling $6 billion worth of exports by 2005. It is interesting to note that in 1996 we exported 44,000 vehicles to the world and last year we exported 112,000 fully built-up vehicles across the world. The shipment that left this morning will mean that Toyota Australia has exported 250,000 individual units, manufactured in Australia, to the markets of the world. Of those - for the interest of the member for Deakin - 200,000 have gone to the Middle East market. If you go to Saudi Arabia or Dubai, all you see are Toyota Camrys driving around everywhere - and they are all manufactured in Australia. They form part of an industry that employs 386,000 Australians. - Exactly right. There has been a significant increase in the number of jobs in the auto sector. That is a direct result of this government's policies in terms of the auto industry in Australia since 1997, but also in terms of the broader economic management of the Australian economy by our government, which has created a much more competitive and efficient environment in Australia so that it can compete in the markets of the world. That is an undeniable fact. We all know that all those changes have been opposed every inch of the way by the Labor Party. They have not supported one of the changes that this government has introduced in that time. If you go and ask the people in the industry, they will tell you that these changes have undeniably been the root cause of the increase in exports to the markets of the world. It is important that we recognise that the Australian export sector is not just fundamentally based on commodities anymore. Our exports are not just minerals, resources and agricultural products; those products are now being equalled, in terms of earning capacity for the Australian economy, by elaborately transformed manufactures like the auto sector. I congratulate Mr Ken Asano and Mr John Conomos from Toyota; they have done a fantastic job, along with their work force. If you go into that factory in Altona, you will see that they do a fantastic job. I recognised that at the launch this morning. They have an assembly line that equals the best in the world.The challenges for the future still rest in the stability of this industry. We have heard in recent times from the AMWU about the militant action that they have taken, particularly to the first tier suppliers because they are the critical suppliers to this industry and can bring it to a standstill. Earlier this year, I tabled a document - the yearbook from the AMWU - which indicated:Our proud traditions of militancy need to be renewed and refined. These are the prospects of challenge for the industry in the future. The industry leaders know what the problems are. If the trade union movement continues to try and undermine the success of this industry the way it has done in the past, it should stand condemned not only by the people that work in the industry and that have achieved these exports but by all Australians, given the contribution the automotive export sector makes to the Australian economy. </DOC>

 - The member, as he habitually does, misrepresents what I said. What I said was: anybody engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct would be prosecuted. If you were passing off ethanol as petrol, that would be misleading and deceptive. But, if one was being honest and saying `this is ethanol', I imagine it would not be breaching the law. What I said was not that they would be prosecuted if they had a 20 per cent blend; what I said was that they would be prosecuted or subject to action for passing off or misleading and deceptive conduct. I have noticed this sort of attempt to try and put a false assumption into the question which, if one does not repudiate it, they try and pass into the public debate. Let us go on from there. We find that the ACCC has written to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage with some recommendations. Fair enough. We find that Environment Australia write off to the manufacturers to get further information - fair enough - as you would expect them to do. I am told by the minister that Environment Australia is responsible for the national fuel standards, that they are considering this matter and that, after they have considered the matter, they will make a determination. That seems fair enough to me. That is what he has informed me is happening. I do not see any big scandal in any of that. What is the slur that the Labor Party then seeks to hang over all of this? The slur that the Labor Party then seeks to hang over all of this is that, somehow, this all leads to Manildra, which the government is seeking to give some corrupt benefit to.  - I repudiate that absolutely, as the Prime Minister did. I repudiate that absolutely. And, by his interjections, he maintains that slur. - See? By his interjections, he maintains the slur. So the allegation is not in relation to the national fuel standards, nor is it in relation to the finding of further information, nor is it in relation to prosecution for misleading and deceptive conduct. The real allegation, confirmed by the interjections here, is that there is some kind of special treatment which is corrupt.  - That is the allegation that Labor makes, and he says, `Got it.' I repudiate that absolutely. It is a slur not only on Manildra but also, if I may say so, a slur on all of the ministers that have been involved with this. There is not one skerrick of evidence to back up that particular slur. It is the kind of thing you would expect from a Labor Party which has no policy, which is going backwards in the polls, which up until today was interested in Iraq and which now veers off on something, presumably for the benefit of its Cunningham by-election. I notice the word `Wollongong' keeps slipping into all of Labor's questions, and I notice that the member for Hotham was going, I believe, to Cunningham today. - He has been to Cunningham today, and the questions have `Wollongong' in them, and the questions have a slur - and if I know my Labor Party, this is nothing but a cheap populist trick.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I certainly can assure the member for Blair that this government does not like strikes. Strikes cost jobs, strikes damage industries and strikes jeopardise Australia's international reputation. Worst of all, the real victims of strikes are normally the ordinary workers of Australia who stand to lose hundreds of dollars from their pay packets to promote the political agendas of union bosses whose pay is not at risk. I am able to say that there is more good news from the Howard government. The latest statistics show that, in the year ending June, days lost through strikes have fallen to the lowest level since the ABS first started keeping these statistics. They are less than half the rate they were in 1996, and they are less than one-seventh the rate they were in the late 1980s, when members opposite were running their so-called accord.I do have to say that, notwithstanding all this good news, one state has bucked the trend. In June, Queensland accounted for nearly 50 per cent of all days lost through strikes, mostly because of a campaign of industrial militancy waged by the public sector unions against the Beattie government. Unions control the Labor Party, but that does not mean that they take any notice of Labor governments. In fact, they think Labor governments are a soft touch. We even had big Bill Ludwig, that great political sire, describing the Beattie government as a bunch of sooks. What do Labor governments do when they are in trouble? They send for Bob Hawke. `Bring back Bob' is what they say. When watching Bob Hawke on TV last night, it was impossible not to feel a sense of profound nostalgia for the days when Labor had a `real' leader. What did Bob recommend? He recommended that there should be new limits placed on the right to strike. That is precisely what the government is trying to do with the cooling off provisions of the genuine bargaining bill currently before the Senate. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition is going to take Bob Hawke's advice when it comes to increasing the union bloc vote at Labor national conferences from zero to 50 per cent. I strongly urge the Leader of the Opposition to also take Bob Hawke's advice and pass the government's genuine bargaining bill. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur, one of the great citizens of Australia who has seen a lot more of Australia than most on the other side ever have and probably ever will, for his question. Australia's second ever Citizenship Day took place this week. I am pleased to report that over 60 citizenship ceremonies have taken place around the nation this week. In fact, almost 3,500 people have joined the Australian family this week, which I think is fantastic. It is 1,000 more than in last year's inaugural event. In fact, two to three times more people would have affirmed their citizenship in special reaffirmation ceremonies that were held in concert with that. So we have something in the order of 10,000 Australians who have been touched by Australian citizenship during this week.The member for Macarthur and others will be interested to know that over 700 new members of the Australian family signed up in New South Wales, 250 in South Australia, 900 in Queensland, 500 in Victoria and 500 in Western Australia. In the last financial year, a total of 86,289 people were conferred with Australian citizenship - up on the previous year, when it was just 72,000, and up on the year before that, when it was 70,000. More citizenship ceremonies will be taking place over the next couple of days. Tomorrow tonight in Sydney the Chinese-Australian Services Society will bring 87 new Australian citizens to the family. Today, South Australia will be welcoming 93 new citizens at a special ceremony. The member for Sturt would be interested in the fact that 12 new citizens were also welcomed into his electorate.In Australia, we have one of the highest take-up rates of citizenship anywhere in the world. In fact, the rate now is at something like 75 per cent - that is, three-quarters of those eligible are taking up the offer to become Australian citizens. That is a significantly higher rate than under the Australian Labor Party, when it was just 65 per cent. This is certainly one of the best take-up rates in the world. In the United States, for example, the rate is somewhere between 50 and 60 per cent. Processing times in Australia are much quicker, with the vast majority of people applying finalised within the first month of lodgment. In the US, Canada and New Zealand, processing times can take six to nine months, on average. Maybe it is because Australia no longer has a million unemployed but, rather, a million new jobs. Maybe it is because there is just a general sense of pride in Australia. Maybe it is because the government is concentrating heavily on a sense of invitation for people to take up the opportunity to join the Australian family. Either way, we are seeing a noticeable improvement in the number of people applying for Australian citizenship. Last year's three-month campaign showed a 56 per cent increase in the applications for Australian citizenship during the life of the promotion and a 454 per cent increase in the number of inquiries for information about becoming an Australian citizen. Of course, it is off to a great start this year, with 1,000 more than last year participating in Australian Citizenship Day. I want to take the opportunity to welcome them all to the Australian family.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, but I am a bit puzzled as to why he would raise the subject matter now, given that the new price controls were gazetted in early July. I think the clue as to why the opposition is turning to this subject now was given a little earlier on: it would not have anything to do with Wollongong, would it? It would not have anything to do with the Leader of the Opposition's disastrous attendance at Wollongong earlier this morning?I recommend as mandatory reading the transcript issued by the Leader of the Opposition's office of a press conference he gave at Wollongong today. He was asked questions which relate very closely to this particular issue: is Mr Howard too hard to beat at the next election and do you have splits in the Labor Party with the member for Franklin crossing the floor? He was asked questions about the smacking they got in the local mayoral election and questions about imposing -  - The Leader of the Opposition, turning to the particular matter contained in the question -  - The Leader of the Opposition, in the midst of this flurry of hostility, said: I will be recommending to my caucus next week that we disallow these new charges in the Senate. After several months and weeks have passed, the opposition has finally discovered the new price controls. The opposition is on very shaky ground here. We are obtaining advice as to effect of a disallowance of the regulation in the Senate. It is a very blunt instrument. The new price controls have many aspects to them. For instance, under the new price controls Telstra is required to reduce the average price of local, trunk and international calls by at least 4½ per cent in real terms each year. It also requires that connection charges must not increase in real terms. The opposition needs to very carefully study the price controls applying to line rental increases, which are consistent with the recommendations of the ACCC. The government requires Telstra to have in place a package of products and arrangements for low-income consumers to protect them from the effect of any line rental increases. All of this will be teased out in further and greater detail. An open invitation exists for all members to attend the debate of the MPI. This is a filler. The opposition have run out of things to say. This is a smokescreen. They have no policy on Telstra. Moreover, it is a distraction, of course, from all of their other policy failings. At this initial stage, we believe that the effect of disallowance will not mean that Telstra is completely free of price controls, as some of the provisions of the previous determination will continue to operate. However, not all of the protections of that previous determination will carry forward, so Telstra will be subject to less price control.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, his interest in education and, in particular, his advocacy for Chisholm Catholic School in his electorate. In responding to the member for Macquarie, I pick up on the interjection from the member for Port Adelaide, who said that the Howard government's education policies are about giving money to the rich, which is very interesting. I will come back to that. This government believes very strongly that all Australian children are entitled to a good, well-resourced education, that all Australians should support the education of students in state government schools and support them through their taxes - state governments being responsible for the regulation, funding and administration of state government schools. In addition, this government believes very strongly that, having made a contribution to state government schools, Australian parents who then choose to should be able to send their children to the kind of school which they think meets the educational aspirations they have for their children - whether it is a Catholic school, an independent school, a Jewish school, a Christian school or any one of a number of non-government schools. The point ought to be made that the 69 per cent of Australian school students who are in state government schools receive 78 per cent of all of the public funding which supports school education. Further to that, every single child who attends a non-government school - a Catholic school or an independent school - receives less money than if that child were being educated in a state school. The kids who come from the poorest families receive at least 30 per cent less than if they were being educated in a state school. That means, for example, that the one in five families earning less than $73 a day who have their children in a non-government school receive at least 30 per cent less than if the child were in a state school and the kids from the wealthiest families receive at least 87 per cent less. I was asked about alternative policies. Last week at a conference on university financing at the Australian National University, the Labor Party's education spokesperson, the member for Jagajaga, was asked a question. I will read the question to the House. The question was: I think everyone has agreed that the more money we get for higher education the better. What I'd like you to address is not the question of whether the government pays for it or the private individual pays for it, but if the Government was going to pay for it, and I think there is a role for that, does the government pay for it by increasing the fiscal deficit ... does the government increase taxes, or does the government do it by selling off other assets ... ? The response is very interesting. The member for Jagajaga said:So yes you can do all the things that you said but you can also rearrange your priorities .... if you look at what's happened to  -  if you compare the increases to non-government schools and compare that to spending on higher education.What the Australian Labor Party plans to do, as the member for Port Adelaide has alluded to in his interjection, is to take money from Catholic and independent schools in this country - to take money from the one million parents of the one million kids in those non-government schools - and put it into higher education. If the Labor Party wants to reorder priorities, what is its plan? Will it close nursing homes? Will it take money from regional roads? Will it leave the sugar industry out to dry? That is the Labor Party's plan.There is one thing the Labor Party has not learned in relation to education. When the member for Macarthur and I spent two days in the western suburbs of Sydney, only two people said anything to me about education. They both said exactly the same thing: `Why is the Labor Party against you sending your kid to a private school?' The one thing the Labor Party has to learn, as Greg and Gina Fletcher know at the Bird in Hand Inn, is that no Labor Party policy has changed. Labor is still against parents working their tails off to give their kids the kind of education that they want. I table the question to and the answer from the member for Jagajaga.</DOC>

 - First of all, the government has, on many occasions, spoken with the United States administration, the Israeli government and various personalities within the Palestinian Authority about the situation in the Middle East. While I was in New York the other day, I met with the Israeli foreign minister, Mr Peres. I was able to discuss these broad issues very extensively with him. There have been many occasions on which I and, importantly, officials from the government have discussed the question of the Middle East with the United States administration, and there is also constant communication between our officials and the various personalities within the Palestinian Authority.In relation to the current stand-off, it is - as I said on a television program yesterday - very much the view of the government that, on the one hand, we continue the position that we have had for some time, which is to urge the Israelis to ensure that they are not too heavy-handed in the way they deal with terrorism, which is a very significant issue for the people of Israel; and, on the other hand, it is the Australian government's view that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority should do everything within their power to endeavour to stop the practice of suicide/homicide bombers. For any liberal democracy - and that is what Israel is - the fact that people are being killed at bus stops, in shopping centres, in university faculties and in restaurants and cafes is entirely unsatisfactory and unacceptable. It is the government's view that the Palestinian Authority needs to do more in order to address that question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question and appreciate the interest he has shown in this extraordinarily important issue. I think honourable members will be aware that President Saddam Hussein announced during the weekend that he would not accept any new Security Council resolutions other than those already agreed by the United Nations Security Council. It is the view of the Australian government that this is an unwise and provocative statement on the part of President Saddam Hussein. Again, it signals Iraq's intention to ignore the will of the international community. It is unfortunately part of a pattern of behaviour that we have come to expect from Iraq: Saddam Hussein feigns acquiescence one day and then says that he will thumb his nose at the international community the next.The government was right last week to be very cautious about the Iraqi foreign minister's offer to accept United Nations weapons inspectors without conditions. As I noted last week in the House, Iraq does have a history of deceiving, frustrating and avoiding United Nations inspections and has been doing that for over a decade. So it is important that we are not naive in relation to this matter. Australia is very supportive of United Nations Security Council efforts to strengthen and set out clearly Iraq's obligations, and to do so in a new resolution. I note the opposition leader nodding and I appreciate his support on this question.We are closely monitoring the progress of the new draft resolution through the Security Council. Our ambassador in New York has been reporting frequently on conversations he has been having with various players there, and he has been providing extensive input into those discussions. So have our ambassadors and staff in key capitals - in particular, London and Washington, but not only there. We understand a draft resolution will be circulated this week for consideration by the wider membership of the Security Council - not just the five permanent members but also the 10 elected members of the Security Council. It is important that any resolution sets out clear and decisive measures which pave the way for timely and unfettered inspections which would allow for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. The resolution must send an unequivocal message to Iraq from the international community that it is time that Iraq complies fully and properly with the United Nations Security Council and, therefore, with international law. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and welcome him back to Canberra. -  - I know it is painful to hear somebody being polite. - As a close ally of the United States, Australia inevitably has consulted with the Americans on military issues and will be kept in the loop as their thinking develops on any military plans, including of course any military plans against Iraq. I remind the honourable member what the Prime Minister said in the House of Representatives a few days ago:We do have an opportunity, because of our alliance with the United States, to have an understanding of American thinking, particularly the military. We have personnel placed within the US command structure and we have had them there since the start of the war against terrorism. One of the advantages of that is that we are able to have a knowledge of the thoughts of the American military not only in relation to existing contributions but also in relation to future contributions that the American military might make to the pursuit of American foreign policy objectives.The United States has made no decision about military action against Iraq, as honourable members know only too well. Let me reiterate what the Prime Minister, Senator Hill and I have said on many occasions, and that is: Australia has not been approached about making any contribution to such military action and nor has Australia made any commitment to do so. Australia would consider a request, should it be made, for a contribution to military action, taking into account Australia's national interests and the circumstance of the time.The honourable member for Griffith asked specifically about articles of the United Nations charter. I would say in response to that that work is currently under way in the United Nations to secure a diplomatic resolution of the issue through the return of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq. That is the current focus of the diplomatic community, it is the current focus of the international community, and no decision has been made by anybody to take military action under any article.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At the outset, I would have to say that this, in many ways, for tens of thousands of farmers and the communities that depend on them, is the cruellest drought of all. We have, over the last couple of years, seen one of the strongest recoveries in rural fortunes of the last few decades. Prices have been very strong. Costs have been down. The government's economic reforms have put them in a stronger general position. Even transport costs are at their lowest real levels ever in this nation, across all four forms of transport. But now we have hit this very unfortunate brick wall in most of Australia, where seasonal conditions are really putting that recovery at risk to the point where it is very likely to show up in national economic performance terms. I had a look around last week in the Western Division of New South Wales, which covers some 40 per cent of New South Wales, although there are only around 1,500 farm units out there. In one Rural Lands Protection Board area, for example, the farm units are so big that there are only 58 farmers in the entire board area. They certainly are facing a very serious situation. ABARE estimates that the net value of farm production will fall by around 63 per cent, largely because of a disastrous winter wheat crop. They are talking about it having declined to maybe 22 million tonnes. Personally, I think even that may be optimistic. In contrast, we were expecting a near record crop of some 40 million tonnes just six months ago.While farm export earnings will decline markedly, it is true that mineral and energy exports will increase. That will offset the downturn in some ways, but the farm sector is clearly hurting badly. I say to those who ask what the Commonwealth has done, the answer is: a great deal, apart from the economic reforms that have brought interest rates way down. How would farmers be placed if they were still facing an interest rate regime of the sort that Labor ran? But beyond that, we have the Farm Management Deposit Scheme picking up where the Labor Party gutted the old IEDs and, under that, we have the capacity for farmers to put aside a financial haystack. Some 24,000 Australian farmers have salted away money in the Farm Management Deposit Scheme so that they have something to draw on in tough times. Indeed, the amount of money in that scheme last year doubled. It is true that not all farmers have been able to access or use the scheme - for example, wool growers, who have had a very tough time right through the nineties, and those who have had two or three years of drought. Sugar farmers of course are also experiencing terrible times in terms of price. In addition to the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, there has also been the Farm Help program. Over $100 million has been paid out through that. When we have tripped exceptional circumstances in the years since we have been in government, some $450 million has gone to nearly 6,000 farmers, many of whom said they would not have survived without it.In the context of the current drought, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced last week, we have moved to respond to concerns about the EC process as much as we can, given that - and this is what the state premiers have not acknowledged - the Exceptional Circumstances Program is a state and Commonwealth agreed program. Within the limits of the agreement, we have sought to make it more flexible, to accelerate the process so that income support can be made available as soon as EC applications are lodged. That will include the Burke and Brewarrina areas, where applications have been lodged by New South Wales.This has been widely welcomed. It reflects our real commitment to helping farmers through the current very serious circumstances. I repeat this very clear injunction: the Commonwealth is prepared to make EC more effective for farmers, and our offer to make it more effective lies on the table for any state Premier. Here is the challenge for any state Premier brave enough to break Labor ranks and demonstrate real concern for their drought-hit communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We need to go back to the High Court and its finding in 1997 that state tobacco franchise fees were unconstitutional. At that time, the Commonwealth - which is not always given proper credit for this - entered into a safety net agreement with the states. That allowed the Commonwealth to collect this revenue and to return it to the states, a measure that was strongly supported at the time. As part of that agreement, the states agreed that the recovery of fees before 5 August 1997 but which were not paid would be the responsibility of the states. I am not aware that any states or territories have tried to recover these funds. I do not see why they should now turn around and say that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility. It is up to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question, and I appreciate the deep concern she has always had to ensure that taxpayers' money is expended wisely. I very much regret to inform the House that today is the ninth anniversary of the notorious Centenary House deal negotiated by the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party. There were two unusual features of this deal. The first was that the term of the lease was for 15 years compared with the Commonwealth's standard term of just five years. The second was the presence in the deal of a nine per cent rent escalation clause. That means that taxpayers are renting the Australian Labor Party's building for more than double the cost of comparable CBD space in Canberra and more than the cost of comparable CBD space in Sydney and Melbourne.Thanks to the latest rent escalation, taxpayers are now paying the Australian Labor Party more than $5 million a year, which is nearly $3 million a year more than this building is worth. Without renegotiation, the Centenary House deal constitutes nothing but a $36 million taxpayer gift to the Australian Labor Party. This morning, and again just before question time, the Leader of the Opposition came into this parliament and railed against corporate excess and threatened retrospective clawback of excessive corporate remuneration. If the Leader of the Opposition is to have any credibility at all on corporate rorts, he must end this rort now.This is a rolled gold rip-off, and it is solely in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition to end it. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has given in to the factional warlords on the question of party reform. The very least he can do is to insist that the Labor Party stops ripping off taxpayers in this way. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point to make is that it is not us that want to remove the price restrictions; it is you by your actions. If you move this disallowance, there will be nothing left in its place and the government would have to consider that outcome.What ought to be looked at here is the context in which these commitments were made by the Labor Party. It has something to do with a fairly desperate Leader of the Opposition wandering around a certain seat on the east coast of New South Wales promising to make a hero of himself by disallowing Telstra line rentals when in reality it has been known for a long time that certain adjustments in relation to line rental fees were a necessary precursor to enabling greater competition in access to those lines. Why do we want better, more competitive access to those lines? So you get more competition in the provision of telephony services. Competition encourages downward movement in prices.I was quite intrigued to discover that there is an outfit called the Southern Phone Company Project. In that aforementioned seat on the east coast of New South Wales, they want access to the lines so that they can provide more competition and cheaper telephony services but they need that more competitive access regime. I think that if the good citizens of that certain seat on the east coast knew all of the facts, they would reject altogether the ALP's opportunism in this instance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for a fair question. She knows, for example, that the 350 workers at the propellent factory at Mulwala worked damn hard to help pay for the education of their children. The important thing in relation to Australian higher education is that the Australian Labor Party in 1988 in government recognised that, in moving to a mass higher education system, Australia in future generations would not be able to rely entirely on the Australian taxpayer to fund an education for everyone who wanted it. It then introduced the higher education contribution scheme. It is worth pointing out that students at the moment in Australia pay about one-quarter of the cost of their courses and that the Higher Education Contribution Scheme at the moment means that the Australian taxpayer, for example workers in regional Australia, have lent in total $8.2 billion to 1,115,317 Australians to help them pay for their higher education. It also ought to be pointed out that the average HECS debt carried by students in Australia is currently $7,800, that 91 per cent of students owe less than $16,000 and that 80 per cent of students owe less than $12,000. So when you consider that the average male graduate will earn about $620,000 more throughout his working life than someone who did not go to university but actually helped pay for three-quarters of the cost, it is not a particularly bad investment.Recently, IDP, which is the marketing arm for Australian universities, compared the cost of higher education in Australia with other countries. It found, for example, that the course costs of university education in Australia are cheaper than for every United States public university, for every US private university, for every university in the United Kingdom, for six universities in Canada and for at least one university in New Zealand. It further found that the living costs for students in Australia - and when you take into account that they were comparing international fees, not the fees paid by domestic Australian students - were 40 per cent lower. I am also asked about other comments. There have been some comments from the member for Jagajaga. The member for Jagajaga told Wollongong radio station Radio 97.3 on 3 September 2000:It is the case now that students in Australia are paying more than students in the United States. That is a pretty shocking state of affairs, and I bet many people are not aware of it.The reason they are not aware of it is because it is not true. She went on to say at a university financing conference here in Canberra the week before last:For their penance, they - the students - are now paying some of the highest university costs in the world.Amongst many others, John Hatzistergos, who is a Labor MLC in New South Wales and is on the Senate for the University of Sydney, recently sent me a report of a study tour he went on in the United States. He found that for a four-year course at a private university in the US, a student pays on average $A45,000. - As the member for Werriwa points out, that is for a private university -  - and for a public university, as I am asked by the Leader of the Opposition, $20,500. What is important is that the Australian Labor Party needs to think about Australia's future, to realise that some things rise above what passes for them as political debate and think about how we are going to finance Australian higher education and to what extent the hardworking taxpayers, who have never seen the inside of a university, will be asked to make an even greater contribution.</DOC>

 - I welcome the first question from the new shadow minister, the third shadow minister in 18 months. I am starting to wonder whether it is a bit of a Work for the Dole program from the Leader of the Opposition. I very much welcome the Productivity Commission's report because, unlike when the opposition was in government and Simon Crean was the employment minister, there was not one independent review of $3 billion worth of expenditure each year. There were only internal evaluations. And the funny thing is that, within six months of the introduction of the Working Nation program, the man sitting opposite me decided that he would no longer show the Australian public the reports at all. - This government can be rightly proud of the fact that in the last 12 months over 320,000 Australians have been matched with jobs through the Job Network. It has put real Australians into real jobs in the last 12 months. When we come to intensive assistance, the first thing to say is that 49 per cent - nearly one in two long-term unemployed under intensive assistance - have actually gone back into work, formal training or education as a result of their time in intensive assistance. I will turn to the last point so erroneously made by the shadow minister that only $11 was going to the long-term unemployed. The department gave this shadow minister a brief-ing the other day, and it is a shame that he did not keep his ears open. To make it quite clear, anyone who is at risk of being long-term unemployed - for argument's sake, someone who is an Indigenous or mature age Australian - will, by having the JSCI applied to them, go into intensive support customised assistance on day one. They will be offered the most direct personalised assistance and will have several thousands of dollars worth of direct assistance available to them.The $11 that the shadow minister seems to be fixated on is the $11 that goes into the job seeker's account, which is only one small part of the direct assistance that is available to the job seeker through the Job Network. The money that the federal government are providing is far more targeted and it is delivering results for the unemployed. But we will not rest on our laurels. We believe that, although a million jobs have been created over the last 12 months, more can be done. And we will deliver more - unlike the Labor Party, who believe that the only way to go is to spend more money and create less outcomes. In fact, if you were to apply the same methodology that was used in looking at the outcomes in IA under this particular system to Working Nation, there would have been a negative impact. By putting people through endless training programs year after year with no relevance to their own capacities, they would have had more people out of work than those in a control group who did not actually participate. Job Network is working for Australia, but more can be done and it can be improved upon. As a result, under our active anticipation model, which comes into effect from 1 July next year, modifications that have been built in through input from organisations such as ACOSS, from Job Network members, from businesses and from the unemployed, we will see an even better system providing targeted support to the unemployed. This will build on the success that this government has had in bringing the unemployment rate from a high of 10.9 per cent, under the Labor Party's stewardship, down to 6.2 per cent, and it is heading further down.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and acknowledge his keen observance of the contribution that international trade plays in the Australian economy. I have a couple of simple facts to share in answering the core point of the question with regard to jobs. Since 1996, we have taken our export earnings in Australia from $99 billion to $154 billion. That sustains one in five jobs across the entire economy and one in four jobs in regional Australia. Of course, we had the announcement only a week or so ago that we have seen the creation of a million new jobs in Australia since 1996. Obviously, exporting has made its contribution to the development of those one million new jobs, and invariably they are better paid jobs, they offer better training opportunities in the workplace and they are with much stronger businesses. Balancing and supporting that over the last six years or so has obviously been the sound economic management that our government have been able to provide in Australia. We have provided a springboard, a very strong foundation, for Australian businesses to launch themselves into the international marketplace. Some of the measures that we have undertaken include being more fiscally responsible with the way we spend money as a government, providing budget surpluses, the tax reform package which unambiguously benefited Australia's exporters, industrial relations reform and, of course, the long and stable low level of interest rates that has really secured the future of Australia's exporting businesses over that period of time.On the other side of the agenda is the ambitious trade policy that we run by focusing our efforts to take every opportunity to open up markets and to remove impediments for Australia's exporters in getting into those lucrative markets across the world. Of course, Australia has always been a key player and advocate within the multilateral system. We played a leadership role in launching the round of WTO negotiations in Doha at the end of last year. As the chair of the Cairns Group, we are driving the agenda as far as agricultural trade liberalisation is concerned. And, of course, in November of this year, I will be hosting a mini ministerial council of WTO ministers in Sydney to keep that agenda moving forward, because we believe that it provides the best opportunity to open up the markets of the world to what we sell and, particularly, to remove some of the inequitable impediments to trade. At the same time, we want to also pursue a bilateral agenda. We are proving that we can do both: we can pursue the multilateral agenda but we also can pursue a bilateral agenda in terms of negotiating free trade agreements. We are well through the process with the Singaporeans and hope to conclude that negotiation shortly. We already have the CER agreement with New Zealand, which is probably the longest standing and purest free trade agreement that exists in the world today. That has seen the trade and investment between our two countries grow dramatically over that period of time. Of course, our ambitions to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States of America are well known.Also, to underpin that, we have developed in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a specific group called the Office of Trade Negotiations, with 72 dedicated trade negotiators in there to focus on the multilateral and bilateral agenda we are running. We believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time, to put it into the parlance -  -  - It is something that the Labor Party do not believe we can do. They have a single-track mind as far as trade is concerned. We believe in an agenda of competitive liberalisation as far as trade policy is concerned. We have established a strong and stable economy in Australia. We are now establishing a strong, multifaceted trade policy that will benefit Australia's trading interests well into the future.</DOC>

 - I am disappointed with the shadow minister, because I hoped that he would have something positive. But I guess, as one of his colleagues the member for Werriwa commented to the media in 1998:... if anyone can find a positive speech or idea that Anthony Albanese has ever put forward in public life I'll buy them a lottery ticket. - Right now, we are in the middle of the tendering process. In fact, today the department sent out the invitations to treat to the higher performing members of the Job Network. To address the shadow minister's question directly, the fact is that we have a star rating system which is determined by the outcomes of jobs and the creation of jobs by all Job Network members. That is out there for the public to see. Unlike the old CES, which of course was a monopoly - where it did not matter how bad the system was, you poured more money into it and you churned people around job matching and job network services - here we have a system which is -  - The point that I would like to make to the House and to the Australian public is that we have a great deal of scrutiny on all Job Network members, whether they be Mission Australia, Maximus, Employment National or any other company. We are interested in one thing: positive outcomes for Australian job seekers. The companies that are delivering those have to be able to prove their financial viability and adhere to a code of conduct. If they do not deliver the services to Australia's unemployed, they will be removed from the system. That is what we have put to those that want to enter Job Network 3, and we will stick to that. It will apply to all companies, regardless of where they come from.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his great interest, on behalf of his constituents, in this particular matter - and I also thank the member for Wannon in that regard. They have both contacted me to raise questions on this very important matter. I can inform the House that, on all indications, Australia can expect an extremely difficult and dangerous fire situation this year. - This is something I would not have thought was a matter for mirth or interjection. The reality is that many of Australia's forests are now heavily overloaded with fuel. There has been a substantial reduction in access as the forests have reverted to reserves where there are no forestry industry roads anymore. As has already been mentioned today, the season has been extremely dry and this, of course, will add to the threat.The member asked what we are doing now. I think it is worth pointing out what has already been done. I refer the House to the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, wrote to the New South Wales Premier offering Commonwealth assistance - in fact, the sum of $50,000 - to coordinate the development of a joint proposal amongst the states and territories on cost-effective options for improving Australia's aerial firefighting capacity. I think those words have a lot contained within them because, quite clearly, at that time the Deputy Prime Minister - and I since I have had that responsibility - have been seeking a national response to what is the extremely expensive capital cost, particularly on an annual basis, of providing aerial firefighting services.The responsibility for this survey and this recommendation was taken up by the Australian Fire Authorities Council - AFAC - and they have made a recommendation to the government. This recommendation includes a very long list and a huge variety of aerial firefighting assets. Most of those assets can be found in Australia, some need to be rented on a long-term basis and others can be hired quite frequently at short notice - for instance, crop dusters and aircraft of that nature, which frequently are in the hangar at that time of the year.However, included in those assets - recommended by every state authority in Australia - were three Erickson air-crane helitankers. One of these is better known as Elvis. The cost of these particular pieces of equipment is very high: over $10 million for three. That is just for the freight and the location costs - the lease costs, if you like - while they are in Australia. It is up-front money. It is too late when you have a fire or a high fire risk to be ringing up America and saying, `What about sending out Elvis?' They have to be here whether we have fires or not. Let us hope that they do not have to be used.Notwithstanding that firefighting is the constitutional responsibility of state governments, the Howard government thought it reasonable to offer, for those specialist pieces of equipment, to pay half the location and rental costs, up to a sum of $5 million. This is something of which I am very proud because it has reduced substantially the cost of that equipment, which has a very significant part to play in protecting people's property; it is called the forest interface between a high forest fire and where houses are. These particular pieces of equipment are responsible - and this is already on the record - for saving many people's homes last year.It is a good initiative. In terms of the question about location which the member asked me, that will be a decision for state governments. We have written to all the ministers, and in particular to the minister in Victoria because Victoria has traditionally hired one of these helicopters. We have asked whether Victoria would be prepared to manage the program. We expect some replies this week as to the details. In conclusion, when you get a good national initiative, and everybody is supposed to be in it, and some want little planes and some want big planes, you get a bit disappointed when one state Premier puts his hand up and says, `I just want $1.9 million of the money.' Eight into five surely does not come out at $1.9 million. That was the Premier of Western Australia. It was a very silly response.Then, because there is a sniff of politics, the member for Corio decides that he will get in on the act. He is running around saying, `Western Australia doesn't want a big helicopter.' The Commonwealth came out to give a national response, and it is just a pity that this is all the member for Corio can see in it. By the way, he never wrote me a letter asking, `Could you please help the people of Australia with some assistance on firefighting?' Oh, no; as soon as a good, positive decision was made, his response was to go crook. The fire chief in Western Australia signed off on the recommendation for three Elvises as part of the package. That is what the Commonwealth is giving assistance with. The Commonwealth has no constitutional responsibility for this. Isn't it about time that, when the right thing is done at the right time, the member for Corio - the member for no ideas - comes along and says that it is a good idea?</DOC>

 - It is interesting that at the last election just 11 months ago when we saw the employment policy - if you could call it that - of the opposition, there was nothing at all about checking anybody who may or may not come into Job Network. - In regard to this particular company, when any organisation looks to change its ownership and it already holds a government contract through the Job Network, it is looked at by the department, the department takes advice as to whether the organisation has the financial capability with which to deliver services and it then has to abide by the code of conduct. A breach of the code of conduct can result in companies losing their entire business, their regional business or their site business. As you would be aware, Job Network 3 is currently under way and letters have been sent to businesses to explain why they may or may not be able to participate in this next contract round. As far as any particular company is concerned, when we go through our tender process we will look at all the criteria, including a wide range of parameters, and the companies will be required to meet those parameters. In the event that a company - whether it be a church based, a not-for-profit or a profitable organisation - subsequently does not meet its contractual arrangements for whatever reason, we reserve the right to be able to remove it from the system. We also reserve the right, under contract 3, to be able to remove those companies who are poor performers, because this government is determined to only have the best level of performance of Job Network members across the entire network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In fact, if I am not mistaken, she has one of the great theme parks on the Gold Coast just outside of her electorate and, as part of that, they are using the Job Network themselves to employ staff. That is fantastic. - Maybe you are looking for a major theme park; who is to say? There are many Australian companies, big and small, that are using the Job Network. Some of those include Coles Myer, Pizza Hut, SPC Ardmona, Shell Autocare in New South Wales, Smiths Snack Foods in Western Australia and the Master Fish Merchants Association, which apparently is better known as the Sydney Fish Market. Not only major corporations are using the Job Network; so are some of Australia's major employers that are not necessarily private companies. In the home state of the honourable member - that of Queensland - the Beattie government understands the benefits of the Job Network. It has been using Mission Australia to recruit staff for its soon to be opened Maryborough prison. I understand that the correctional services there will be filling some 200 positions using the Job Network, because it is a quality organisation getting quality candidates for the public service in Queensland.I am also told that the Beattie government `tried before it bought', so to speak, and used the Job Network on previous occasions. It was impressed with the services they delivered, and so it went ahead and used them again. The very devastating fire ant problem in Queensland, which I am sure the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry would be only too aware of, required personnel to be brought on board. On that occasion, the Beattie Labor government employed the organisation of another Job Network member, Sarina Russo, to employ those personnel. At a chance meeting last Friday at a breakfast in Brisbane, one of her managers pointed out to me that some of the long-term unemployed who had managed to gain employment as a result of that are mature age long-term unemployed, and that was very welcome.Instead of giving us the negative harping criticism we receive in this place, perhaps those who sit opposite should take a leaf or two out of the books of other Labor governments who have not only recognised the importance and the success of the Job Network but have actually let their actions speak louder than their words and have backed the Job Network to employ Queenslanders in jobs that are meaningful for them and the state.</DOC>

 - This must be the first time that any member has ever risen in this place and complained about people getting jobs, particularly young people. The member for Werriwa was dead right when he said, `You're never going to hear a positive thing out of the member for Grayndler.' The question about traineeships and apprenticeships -  - I understand you still have your training wheels on but, when you take them off, you may like to know that the minister responsible for traineeships and apprenticeships is in fact the cabinet minister sitting behind me, Dr Nelson. Perhaps your question would be better directed to him. This government stands behind both its school based traineeships and the fact that, having had a 30-year low in apprenticeships when we came to government in 1996 - as a thank you from the Australian Labor Party to the young people of this country - today we have, under the New Apprenticeships system, a growth in employment through both apprenticeships and traineeships. - Those opposite would have denied young people jobs by removing the wages -  - All we have heard from the shadow minister, in the only questions that he has asked, has been negative harping. We are talking about young Australians getting jobs and traineeships, which this government supports. As far as junior wage rates are concerned, you would only have people removed from the workplace through your unfair dismissal laws and removal of junior wage rates. This government stands by its record of employing more than one million Australians since it came to government.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for Riverina on two counts - as a great advocate for her constituency and also in her capacity as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. No doubt you are going to be doing some very good reports in the future. Yesterday I announced the first step towards building a national agenda for early childhood. This early childhood agenda will focus on three key areas: early child and maternal health, early learning and care, and supporting child friendly communities. This is part of this government's approach to building a national agenda for looking at future investment in children.I am glad that this side of the House is keenly interested in pursuing the best outcomes for our children, as opposed to the opposition, judging by some of their comments. I would like to thank some key members of the government who have assisted here: the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and of course the Attorney-General. All of them have been working together quietly behind the scenes to develop a national agenda and an approach which is all about providing the best outcome for children. Why should we in the coalition government not be concerned? We know that those early years from zero to five are crucial years in children's brain development, particularly when it comes to their educational, behavioural and health outcomes. If you enhance those early years then when young children go through primary school and high school, through their teenage years to adulthood, there is a very strong correlation with reducing substance abuse, with minimising the number of young children that end up in the juvenile justice system and - the ultimate - with avoiding the reliance on welfare, which unfortunately is happening more and more with intergenerational welfare dependency, particularly starting at a very young age. I welcome the support from the AMA and from some very leading Australians - Professor Fiona Stanley, Graham Vimpani and also Frank Oberklaid, who have been keen advocates in assisting the government on developing this national agenda for children.There is another point I would like to make today, and that is that today the coalition government gave its formal response to the Child Care: Beyond 2001 report by the Commonwealth Child Care Advisory Council, which was established a few years ago. I would like to thank Patrice Marriott, who was the chair of that council, and all other members, who made an enormous effort in bringing forward some of the key issues regarding child care. One of the key recommendations they made was to develop a national framework for early childhood, which of course the government is doing, and, secondly, to recognise the key issues that are affecting the child-care sector. They recognised, particularly by the community's response, that child-care workers are not just in babysitting but in children's services, a most valuable resource. They are looking - and certainly it is what I intend to do from a Commonwealth point of view - to work with the states and territories through the Child Care Reference Group as well as a think tank that will be established to bring on board all those participants. When it comes to pay and conditions, that is the principal jurisdiction of the states and territories, although we recognise, and I think the shadow member recognises as well, that there is a need to put more value on the work that people do in this sector, and part of that is getting the wider community to recognise their expertise and the effort that they put in.In conclusion, there is a very good reason why this government is absolutely committed to the provision of child care. We are spending record amounts, despite the member for Gellibrand's comments today at a rally where she claimed we were not. May I reiterate that we are spending 70 per cent more than Labor did in its last six years of office. There are 2,000 more services now. We have record numbers of children in Commonwealth funded child care, and the costs have gone down.</DOC>

 - The government strongly support private home ownership, of course. We always have. And we have sought to provide the right sort of environment to maximise the chances of Australians owning their own homes. Nothing has been more important to that than lower interest rates and a generally more competitive banking environment, which has flown from the very responsible changes we have made in the nation's prudential arrangements. But we never have and we never would encourage people to go beyond that which is prudent in terms of their borrowing requirements, nor would we encourage lending institutions to go beyond what is reasonable in terms of lending money to those who might be vulnerable.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I appreciated the opportunity to observe southern right whales off the coast of his electorate as they increase in number as a result of our policies. The Howard government are seeking a global ban on commercial whaling and are working at the domestic, regional and international levels to help promote the recovery of these endangered species. Our primary focus is the International Whaling Commission, where earlier this year Australia achieved its most successful vote yet for establishing a South Pacific whale sanctuary: 24 in favour, 16 against and five abstentions. We will be taking our nominations again to Berlin for next year's IWC meeting.The Howard government are also looking at other international bodies to complement and support our efforts in the IWC. This includes the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, which protects migratory species that are endangered or that have an unfavourable conservation status. The Conference of Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species is currently meeting in Bonn and will decide tomorrow night - Australian time - whether to accept Australia's nomination of six great whales under the convention. I am pleased to announce that the Scientific Council for the convention last week endorsed Australia's position. This decision reinforces Australia's broader push to protect migratory whale species.Australia has now nominated six great whales for listing on the convention: the Antarctic minke, the brooders, the fin, the pygmy right, the sei and the sperm. Listing under the convention would give other nations in the South Pacific an avenue to establish regional whale protection zones in the South Pacific and to undertake other conservation actions which could involve developing and implementing whale watching guidelines, developing non-lethal research programs and developing and implementing bicatch mitigation strategies. I urge all members of the convention to stand with Australia to protect these magnificent migratory species by agreeing to formally list them on the convention when the Conference of Parties meets tomorrow night.The behaviour of the coalition in promoting the conservation of these species stands in very stark contrast to the lack of any action during the 13 years of the Labor government - which failed to do anything to protect these very important species. In particular, they opposed the environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation which enables the Commonwealth to establish whale conservation plans. I am very pleased to say that there is evidence that we are seeing the recovery of some of these species but, unfortunately, commercial whaling devastated a number of the major species, and the listing of these under the convention as a result of Australia's actions would be a great step forward in seeing the populations of the great whales increase again.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that I remember, before I came into this place, seeing quite regularly on television the many tragic stories from people who had set out to purchase their own homes when interest rates were reasonable - back in the days when the Hawke government came to power - only to find that they were left in the most appalling financial circumstances when housing interest rates rose to 17 and 18 per cent under the sort of one-dimensional, blunt instrument approach to economic management that the ALP engaged in.Any suggestion that we are `planning', to use the word put up by the shadow minister, to exacerbate a crisis that does not exist - quite seriously, home ownership I suspect has never been as achievable as it has been under this government - is absolutely absurd nonsense. To seek to pan the Prime Minister's proposals to have a look at further options for reasonably enhancing people's chances of achieving the great Australian dream of owning their own home I think deserves to be confined to the rubbish bin - it really does. It is just absurd. What the Prime Minister has done is set up a task force to look at the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and at issues faced by home owners in outer metropolitan areas in particular. I would have thought that might have been of interest to those opposite. There is a certain seat I referred to earlier - Cunningham, I think is its name - where all sorts of opportunistic practices are being engaged in. The Leader of the Opposition wants people to believe that if they overturn increased line rental fees then people will get cheaper rentals on their telephone lines. It is not actually going to happen; the opposite is going to happen. And in this case I would have thought those constituents would have liked the Leader of the Opposition and his front bench to join with us in looking at every option. Some of them may or may not work out, but that is no excuse for not looking at every option for improving the prospects of people owning their own homes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and recognise his diligent representations on behalf particularly of Landcare coordinators and other facilitators of programs funded under the Natural Heritage Trust and, in particular, the concern that their employment should be secured during the period when we are winding down the old first division of the NHT and opening up the 2nd NHT. Some negotiations are necessary with the states and other parties to put in place the programs which will underpin the new NHT, and during that period many people have been concerned about the security of their employment. So I was pleased to announce last week $25 million in federal government funding to help ensure that this vital resource base, these skills, are not lost to rural and regional communities and, indeed, some urban communities whilst the arrangements for the NHT2 are put in place.Landcare coordinators and facilitators undertake a broad range of activities to provide resources, to help build the skills base and to help communities also to identify their local needs and then set about resolving the problems. These people make an extraordinary contribution towards the landcare movement, which has become internationally recognised as a community based way of dealing with environmental degradation issues. I know there are some opposite who believe that Canberra knows best or the capital city knows best. We very much believe that these projects work best when they are driven at the local and regional level. A very important part of the new national action plan and, for that matter, the NHT will be the regional focus and the partnerships that will be developed between communities and governments to develop the projects of significance to them.As a result of the funding announced last week some 560 people will be employed or will continue in employment through the Landcare grants program to ensure that this vital pool of resources will be available as the NHT is further advanced. The honourable member for Mallee may be interested to know that there are 19 of these coordinators in his electorate. There are 17 in the electorate of the member for Parkes, who I note is particularly interested in these matters as well. In fact, most members are likely to have some Landcare coordinators appointed whose positions have been secured as a result of this initiative of the government. So the federal government has made a major commitment to the Natural Heritage Trust: a further $1 billion now to NHT mark 2 and the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The people's base, the resource base, will now be in place and continue to be maintained as a result of the announcement of these positions late last week.</DOC>

 - Let me say at the outset that on this side of the House, since the beginning of the debate that we had in the parliament last week, we have endeavoured not to make political points on this serious issue. That question is an endeavour to make a political point. Equally, I suppose I could spend a good deal of my time standing at the dispatch box here drawing attention to a whole raft of contradictory statements made by the other side of the House, including contradictions between the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs and the Leader of the Opposition. But we have chosen not to do that because we have taken the position that this is a serious issue at a very serious time in international consideration of this issue when the parliament needs to reflect in a very balanced, mature and constructive way on the choices that lie ahead. The government's position is perfectly clear. The honourable member knows exactly what the government's position is on this question. The government's position, if the honourable member wants me to repeat it, is that we very much hope that there will be a new resolution passed through the Security Council during this week - or slightly beyond perhaps, but very soon - and that Iraq will comply with that Security Council resolution and will comply with all of its obligations under international law. It is not the view of the government that we should walk away from this extremely difficult and challenging issue. We will see the extent to which Iraq does comply with its international obligations. If in the end Iraq fails to comply with its international obligations, then obviously consideration for further action by the rest of the international community will have to be given.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very real interest in this matter. At the outset I seek to pay tribute to the Prime Minister as Chairman in Office of the Commonwealth. Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister very successfully chaired a 19 March meeting in London of the Commonwealth leaders troika on Zimbabwe. At that stage the troika agreed to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth and called for a series of practical steps towards political reconciliation, electoral reform and sustainable land reform, subject to the rule of law, after an adverse report from Commonwealth electoral monitors on Zimbabwe's presidential elections. As I believe the House is aware, Mr Howard has since convened a second troika meeting in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, to review the apparent lack - the very regrettable apparent lack - of progress since March.The Commonwealth Group - Australia, Nigeria and South Africa - met last night in the capital of Nigeria to consider further action on the matter of Zimbabwe. A formal statement has been issued by the Commonwealth secretariat, which I will table. It has to be said, though, that while the 23 September meeting of the Commonwealth leaders troika on Zimbabwe did not go as far as Australia believed was warranted, we have made an appropriate and firm stand on Commonwealth values. The troika members expressed deep disappointment that President Mugabe refused to join them, despite a courteous and proper invitation in the normal way from the Prime Minister.The troika heard a very sobering report from the Commonwealth Secretary-General on the ongoing and deeply disturbing situation in Zimbabwe, where the harassment of the political opposition, the press and sections of the judiciary continues and where division and hostility have increased regrettably in recent months. Deep regret has been expressed that the process of reconciliation in Zimbabwe attempted by the presidents of Nigeria and South Africa has stalled and that the Commonwealth Secretary-General has been unable to establish a dialogue with the government of Zimbabwe. The troika agreed that efforts to engage the government of Zimbabwe should continue. Australia supported the immediate full suspension of Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. I want to make it plain that the outcome statement clearly reflects our position. Nigeria and South Africa, however, sought a further six months for Zimbabwe to respond to Commonwealth requirements before the review meeting in March of next year, when stronger measures may very well need to be considered.Again I say that we applaud the Prime Minister in this place for taking a firm stand on Commonwealth values - a stand, I believe, that all Australians would applaud and would support very strongly. In relation to the possible imposition of sanctions, I discussed this a matter of minutes ago with the Prime Minister. I want to just say that the government have been keeping, and will continue to keep, this issue under constant review. We will continue to do so in the light of the outcomes from this meeting and reactions from Zimbabwe. We will discuss that matter further, as necessary, on his return. I table the communique.</DOC>

 - First of all, I repeat what I said earlier: in the context of the debate over the last two weeks on this difficult and very important issue, I honestly do think that it is very regrettable that the Leader of the Opposition thinks this is a great issue for party politicking. - The whole question of so-called American unilateral action against Iraq is entirely hypothetical because the United States administration has not made a decision to take military action against Iraq. It is a point that I think the House is fully aware of. Nobody in the United States administration - in particular the President, who is also the Commander-in-Chief - has made a decision to take unilateral action, as the Leader of the Opposition puts it, against Iraq. The situation is - and the Leader of the Opposition knows this only too well - that this is a matter currently before the Security Council. The Americans are working with Britain and a number of other countries to try to get a resolution through the Security Council.To be asking questions which are entirely hypothetical and to be getting the government to answer hypothetical questions about circumstances that have not arisen is inappropriate. The government does not have a position on hypothetical situations; the government has a position on practical, real-world situations. The real-world situation here is perfectly clear. The real-world situation is that there is an endeavour to get a resolution through the Security Council. In conclusion, let me say that I think it is important that members of this House do what they can in their public advocacy to place as much pressure as they possibly can on Iraq to comply with their obligations under the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I do not think that we, as a parliament, should be straying into the area of the hypothetical. I think that we, as a parliament, should be maximising our pressure on Iraq and on Saddam Hussein to do what he and his government are required to do under international law.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the member for Ryan for his sensible and considered question, because on this side of the House this is an issue that we treat very seriously. This is a profound and grave issue that the parliament needs to address, and I am glad that the member for Ryan has taken that approach. Let me say that a solution to the crisis that now confronts the world over Iraq must be a solution that allows United Nations weapons inspection teams unfettered and timely access for the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities. We are working, particularly in New York through our ambassador and our mission there, with a number of countries and, of course, with the United Nations as well. In addition, today the Prime Minister will be meeting with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in London. He will also be meeting with Jack Straw, the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I would draw the House's attention to the fact that, this afternoon Australian time, the British government will be releasing their dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.For the convenience of the House, tomorrow I will table the document in the House so that honourable members will have the opportunity to read the document. You could get it off the web site and so on, but we want to facilitate honourable members' capacity to look at the document because I am sure that they will find it very interesting reading. In the meantime - as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question - consideration is still under way in New York, particularly amongst the P5, the five permanent members of the Security Council, of a new resolution to put through the Security Council either during this week or possibly a little later.It is certainly our view that it would be optimal for the new resolution to be agreed by the Security Council before the United Nations mission, UNMOVIC, and its Executive Chairman, Dr Hans Blix, meet with the Iraqis. This meeting is to take place in Vienna next week, beginning on 30 September. It is important that that resolution be a strong and definitive one about Iraq's responsibility to allow those inspectors unfettered access and freedom of movement around Iraq as well - not to put in place obstacles to the movement of the inspectors. It certainly needs to strengthen the inadequacies of the earlier memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the United Nations Secretary-General which left room for restrictions, in particular on access to presidential palaces. I have said this before, but in Iraq the President has defined as presidential palaces something in the vicinity of 42 palaces, which I would say to the House is a lot of palaces. -  - I am glad that the opposition takes this issue so seriously! The fact is, of course, that these presidential palaces are not palaces in the colloquial understanding of the term but, in many cases, are very large compounds and clearly can be used for the hiding of documentation and even weapons of mass destruction capabilities. So I do think the new resolution is important in order to address the inadequacies and the inadequate conditions, for that matter, under which UNSCOM, UNMOVIC's predecessor, had to operate.In conclusion, yesterday I met with representatives from two countries who are elected members of the Security Council. I met with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mexico and also the new High Commissioner for Mauritius. I took the opportunity to stress to both of them the government's view that it is important that the Security Council takes decisive action in the form of a new resolution. I think the government are doing everything they can to try to encourage both a peaceful solution and a solution which is consistent with international law and Security Council resolutions. We will continue to work as best we can at that. I think we can look forward, during the next few days, not just to a new Security Council resolution - because I am optimistic that that will get through; I think in the end the Russians will see the benefit of agreeing to a new Security Council resolution - but also to tabling in the parliament the British dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. I would be the last member of this House to defend the conduct of the Ansett management team prior to the Ansett collapse. I think everything that has emerged about the conduct of Ansett in the months, and perhaps the years, prior to that commercial tragedy suggests that it was badly managed. So I would be the last -  - person to defend the conduct of that management and those senior executives. This government believe in protecting workers' entitlements, and we have done that in a way which has never been done before by any previous Australian government. We believe in protecting workers' entitlements, but we do not believe in retrospective legislation. We believe that retrospective legislation offends all the usual principles of natural justice. If members opposite are that concerned about retrospective rip-offs, I suggest the first thing the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton should do is demand that their own party hand back the money they ripped off from Australian taxpayers through the Centenary House deal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question and acknowledge the deep effect that the drought has had in his own electorate and his continuing interest in securing relief and support for farmers facing difficulties. As was reported to the House yesterday, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in its forecast announced yesterday, predicted a $6 billion downturn in gross farm production and a $3.8 billion reduction in net farm incomes. This will obviously have a very significant impact on farmers themselves and on their rural communities, and, indeed, when farmers do not have that amount of money to spend, it also affects their capacity to purchase services and supplies in the cities. So it has an impact on our nation as a whole. I have noted that some reports in the press suggest that there may be food shortages and dramatic price increases. I think those statements are somewhat dramatic. We need to put some of these things into perspective. There is only about 4c worth of wheat in a loaf of bread. Even if wheat went up 20 per cent, it would still mean only a 1c increase in the price of bread. There are similar tales in relation to other produce on the supermarket shelves. There will obviously be some upward pressure on prices as a result of shortages but, in the tradition of the past, Australian farmers will continue to make sure that there is adequate food and fibre for all Australians. We export two-thirds of what we produce, so there will be plenty of food and drink for Australians even through these difficult times.Some families are facing particular difficulties, and we need to be in a position to provide assistance to them. Yesterday, my parliamentary secretary announced the provision of $8.2 million in funding to support 62 financial counselling services in rural areas to make sure that they will be able to continue their excellent work in helping families in distress. The Farm Help program is also helping quite a number of families. Over $2 million has already been paid out to farming families this financial year, providing welfare assistance to those in particular need. As the Acting Prime Minister mentioned yesterday, farmers have over $1 billion in the Farm Management Deposit Scheme which will help them fund their own way through the difficult times ahead. That scheme is a very valuable scheme -  - which was gutted by Labor. - You utterly destroyed it. - It seems that the Leader of the Opposition is trying to reinvent history. It is clearly a scheme that was originally introduced by a coalition government. It was effectively destroyed by Labor and was reinvigorated under this government. It is now demonstrating its capacity to make a worthwhile contribution in these difficult times. Once again we have the ill-informed interjections from the opposite side. The honourable member asked me whether there were any other alternative policies around. Ironically, we have had two media releases on drought put out in the last couple of days. They clearly demonstrate that there are no alternative policies in relation to drought. Senator O'Brien, who is the opposition spokesman on these matters, has put out a press release blaming everybody else but offering absolutely nothing himself in relation to assistance for farmers. In fact, his press release contains at least four errors of fact, statements that are simply wrong, yet that is the basis of Labor's policy. He probably tried to get something through the shadow cabinet, but agriculture ministers usually miss out when they go to the shadow cabinet. Their proposals well and truly fall on infertile ground in that sort of territory. Shadow minister Senator O'Brien suggested that the first thing that the government ought to do is to introduce comprehensive reform of the exceptional circumstances arrangements. He acknowledged that I had been working on that for the last couple of years. What he seems to have forgotten is that it was his Labor mates at the state level who stamped that out last month. They said they will not be a part of the reform. So, if anyone is concerned about the reform of the exceptional circumstances arrangements, Senator O'Brien should start with his Labor state mates. - He then went on to suggest that we should have buffer zones around the EC areas so there are not rigid lines that cut one producer off and make another eligible. Again, where has he been for the last couple of years? The last three declarations have all had buffer zones surrounding them and the arrangements for New South Wales, if that area is eventually declared, will also have a buffer zone to make sure that there are not rigid boundaries. He then went on to suggest that we should deal promptly with the New South Wales EC application and assess it quickly. Was he asleep when we announced last week that the application has already been referred to the National Rural Advisory Council for consideration and that, in the interim, we will be providing welfare assistance to the people who are affected? Clearly, Labor are asleep at the wheel. They have no responses whatsoever in relation to helping farmers in need. I note that another press release came from the shadow minister for the environment. He has a magic cure for droughts: sign the Kyoto accord and then, suddenly, all droughts will end. That is his proposal. If we sign the Kyoto protocol, it will suddenly rain more and farmers will have no problems! I suggest that the shadow minister for the environment should talk to Senator O'Brien so that the Labor Party can have a policy in relation to exceptional circumstances. - The clear reality is that Labor has no answers on these issues. It is the same old thing. Clearly, if farmers want a caring government that is going to respond to these issues of concern, they need to go to a coalition who will always be there and be responsive to their needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and make the observation at the outset that - as the previous spokesman from this side referred to - as a general principle retrospective legislation which goes to the provision of penalties is something that we do not regard as fair and appropriate. Where penalties are concerned, we seek to make reasonable laws as circumstances unfold.I note that, on this whole area of workers' entitlements, I do not think I could think of an area where the Australian Labor Party have been more hypocritical. They had 13 or 14 years in government and never tackled this issue. They continue by their silence to support the outrageous claims made by the ACTU that we have not done anything to help Ansett workers when in reality we have put in the most far-reaching and substantial set of workers' entitlements arrangements that any government has overseen in this country - arrangements that have seen well over $300 million paid to Ansett workers, for whom we had a great deal of pity. We on this side were prepared to do things for the very workers you say you stand up for, workers that you, in 13 years of government, never moved to help.We have acknowledged the need to act in the case of those company directors who claim outrageous bonus payments - and frankly there have been too many instances of outrageous bonus payments and what have you. That legislation has been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister. But, as we have clearly indicated, we do not believe that it is appropriate, where penalties are involved, to introduce retrospective law. I suspect the overwhelming bulk of Australians would support and uphold that principle.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member and note his very real interest in this matter. We do believe indeed that the Scoresby Freeway is a vitally important project for the development of Victoria. I can see people in the gallery who plainly want it to happen. We want it to happen as well. It is good to see some Victorians here. That is why we put serious money on the table for this project, including $68 million for this financial year to kick it off, and that is on the table now. I record my very real disappointment that we are not going to be able to spend our $68 million this year.The honourable member has asked whether we had been kept up to date by Victoria on what was happening. I have to say that that is a good question. I had to write to the Victorian government twice, asking for a copy of the business case. Last Friday, six months after it was originally due, my department was finally briefed on the Victorian business case. I have to say we still only have part of it. But they told us at that time that they were considering combining the state contribution not for Scoresby alone but for two projects, Scoresby and the Eastern Freeway extension, together into a private partnership. At the same time, they reassured us that they would be kept separate for the purposes of us and our commitment.Something must have happened over the weekend because yesterday the Victorian transport minister announced their intention to combine the Eastern Freeway extension into the Scoresby development. Not only that, in what I think would have to be described as a very transparent move, they renamed the project without consulting us. They renamed it after two marginal Victorian seats. There you go: if that is not opportunism, I do not know what is.But there are some serious problems with this. By rolling the Eastern Freeway project into the Scoresby Freeway, regrettably construction will not begin on either project - remember, we do not construct these things; Victoria does - until mid 2004, two years away. That is two years after we were told construction would begin, when we have our money on the table. We want to see bulldozers on the ground working and that is what we have put our money up for. This is just another excuse, it seems to us, for Victoria not to put its money up. That is a real concern. The honourable member asked me how this development would affect the Commonwealth's commitment. I just want to say that we remain committed to the original project, despite the incompetence of the Bracks Labor government.Let us work through a couple of other issues. Less than 12 months ago, we were told that the Scoresby Freeway would cost $890 million. Now we are told it will cost $1.4 billion. That is a more than 50 per cent increase. The question needs to be asked: how can we trust these figures when the goalposts keep moving on us? I know that the members for Deakin, Aston, La Trobe and Dunkley, not to mention other people in Victoria, want this project delivered. They want it under way. I have to pose the question as to whether the Leader of the Opposition has been doing his job and having a quiet word to his cronies in Victoria, because he lives very near them: `Just get on with it, Steve. You look a bit as though you can't deliver, Steve.'Ironically, and in conclusion, I note that this announcement has come at the same time that the Bracks government has been running self-congratulatory advertisements on television in Victoria, telling people how the state is doing so much in building infrastructure. The ad says: `The Scoresby Freeway is a huge incentive. It will save heaps of travel time. Faster access to the port, Melbourne airport and the Hume. You can't get better infrastructure than this.' The ad should say: `You can't get better infrastructure than this because Steve Bracks is a ditherer and can't make a decision.' - That is what it ought to say. If Steve Bracks cannot make a decision, he ought to move aside for someone who can and who can get on with this project.</DOC>

 - The first point I would make, when you talk about clawing back $500 million from Australian families, is that we have increased family tax benefits to the tune of $2 billion. They are up, not down. We have sought to be more generous. - He immediately concedes the point; that is what he just did. We have substantially increased tax benefits to Australian families. They are very much better off under the set of arrangements we have put in place. - As members of the House may recall, over five years ago - this issue has suddenly arisen now; it might have something to do with a state election - the High Court, in a case called Hammond, decided that the legislative scheme implemented by the states and the territories was invalid. What did the states do to try to address the problem of a $5 billion revenue shortfall? They came to the Commonwealth. What did the Commonwealth do? We facilitated a solution. We came to the party; we did the right thing.There is the suggestion that, somehow, the Commonwealth has been derelict in its duty to taxpayers and has not met the reasonable requests of the states - despite the fact that, at the time, some of them were pretty unfair in their criticisms of the Commonwealth in general and the Treasurer in particular. The Commonwealth has moved to do the right and responsible thing and has put back into place Commonwealth legislation under which, via a Commonwealth-state agreement, it could recover this money.There was a timing issue in relation to the period between the beginning of July and early August 1997, during which, for constitutional reasons - because Commonwealth legislation to collect the excise was not in place and we were not in a position to collect the money, which was acknowledged by the states - the states undertook to collect the money themselves if they could. After five years, it would appear that one or two states have a bit of an interest in trying to make political capital out of this. I want to make a very important point: anecdotal evidence suggests that at least some of the money collected by retailers and given to the tobacco companies or the wholesalers has now been refunded by those tobacco companies to retailers. - I do not know. We will try to find out more, but we do not know how much it is. Furthermore, there is legal action pending in relation to this, and it may very well be that the so-called windfall to the tobacco companies will prove not to be a windfall at all. As this unfolds, the money may very well be returned to the small businesses and other retailers who paid it in the first place.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Lingiari for his question. This follows comments made this morning by his counterpart, the member for Fraser, the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters. The first point I would make in answer to the question is that the GST is Labor Party policy now. The Labor Party support the GST. And, given that the Labor Party support the GST, I think they would be familiar with the fact that all revenue from the GST goes to the states. So, in the first place, any revenue that may come from the GST -  - In terms of there being any windfall from the GST out of any changes to prices across the economy, that is a windfall that would fall to the states. Secondly, in relation to fuel excise - and the honourable member may not be aware of this because this may not be Labor Party policy - the honourable member may be interested to know that the government, last year, scrapped the indexation of fuel excise. The fact is that the sorts of windfalls that the honourable member may be alluding to may not, at first flush, be windfalls that the Commonwealth would get. In the second case, any analyst of this situation has to take into account the elasticity of demand for petrol. The simple fact is that if there are substantial increases in oil prices and therefore petrol pump prices then inevitably, in these circumstances, that has the potential to reduce demand for the product. - Mr Speaker, thirdly, inevitably, prices across the economy are going to fluctuate according to domestic and international circumstances. The fluctuation in prices can have implications, both positive and negative, for revenue. That is why, on a half-yearly basis, this government produces its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook document. The last such Outlook was produced at the time of the last budget. At an appropriate timing, consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty that this government introduced, a further Outlook will be produced and, if there are any adjustments to be made in estimates of revenue, they will be made clear to the parliament at the appropriate time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I think has been canvassed substantially in this place, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is oversighting a testing procedure to establish appropriate levels - minimums and maximums, if applicable - in law for future ethanol blending in this country. But, to this point in time, the fact is that those limits have not been established. Internationally, there is a range of experiences. There are conflicting views on the impact on motor vehicle engines and so forth.In their continual pursuit of this matter, one has to wonder aloud - if I may for a moment - just what the ALP's objectives are. I would have thought trying to grow a new ethanol industry, a bigger ethanol industry, in Australia was a desirable objective. I would have thought it might have created some extra jobs and that it might have been good for regional development. I would have thought that there might very well be some substantial environmental benefits. These matters are under review. I would have thought the ALP might have had some interest in pursuing it, but they seem to have all sorts of objectives in pursuing the interests of other groups. Perhaps they are interested in Trafigura and feel that they need some defence. It is only a little company worth about $US9 billion and is one of the biggest commodity traders in Europe. According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, it is the subject of an ongoing international investigation into oil smuggling. - I am trying to establish why the ALP seems to be so against the development of an Australian ethanol industry, which I think could produce jobs and - done properly in a policy framework that is appropriate - could create further economic activity in regional Australia, which I am all for and which I think a lot of people on this side of the House are for. It strikes me that perhaps the ALP has an interest in defending Trafigura. I make the point that they are the subject of an ongoing international investigation into oil smuggling under the UN oil for food program in Iraq and, according to the Thailand daily newspaper the Nation, they are also at the centre of a customs investigation into irregularities in oil imports to that country.The other possibility is that the ALP, having been wedded to excise increases on fuel - they made it an art form for raising revenue when they were in government - have perhaps broken that practice now and really want to see us in this country importing fuels and substitute fuels which can be sold in this country without excise at very great cost to the taxpayer. I ask the question: why are the ALP continuing to pursue what seems to be, on the surface of it, an anti-Australian approach to ethanol?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and for his obvious interest in the jobs growth that has taken place in Australia in the last six or so years. We have seen a million new jobs created in the Australian economy as a direct result of the sound economic management by our government in Australia. That has also significantly assisted the export sector in increasing their capacity in the international marketplace and in sustaining many new jobs within the Australian economy.I will highlight one particular sector of importance to the Australian economy as far as exports are concerned, and it is not the commodities sector and it is not the services sector. It is the area of manufactures - an area in which Australia has long sought to see an expansion of our exports. Currently, 17 per cent of Australia's export earnings come from elaborately transformed manufactures, and they sustain many tens of thousands of jobs within Australia. This is an area that is not highly reported but, as I say, of the $154 billion worth of export earnings that we receive in Australia, 17 per cent are earned by ETMs - elaborately transformed manufactures.I will highlight one area to the member for Aston that is continuing to grow at a rapid rate. It is the high-tech area of precision measuring and controlling instruments. We are developing intellectual property in Australia through investing in innovation in this country in recent years, through providing a stable economic environment and through providing an environment that is very conducive to being far more competitive in the international marketplace. The precision measuring and controlling instruments sector exported around $751 million worth of goods in 2001. It is the eighth largest manufactured export out of Australia, it involves around 300 companies and we have seen a growth of 16 per cent in employment in this sector since 1996. Quite obviously, our government's policies in terms of creating a very strong and stable economic environment in Australia are creating opportunities in the international marketplace and seeing the expansion in our exports of not just commodities and services but also elaborately transformed manufactures, which are sustaining an increasing number of jobs in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is currently considering the issue of a cap on the ethanol content appropriate for petrol. The paper to which the opposition shadow minister refers reported also that there was considerable disagreement amongst experts as to what the appropriate level of the cap should be. The government is currently considering this issue by undertaking appropriate studies to determine the impact of different levels of ethanol on motor vehicle engines. The government has put in place a $5 million study into market barriers to the uptake of biofuels. As part of this study, the government is conducting an investigation into the impact of 20 per cent ethanol content on motor vehicle engines. It is also, with reference to the previous question, conducting studies into the impact of different ethanol blends on two-stroke engines. It is very important in this area that the decision the government takes be based on appropriate scientific evidence. There are, as the Acting Prime Minister said quite correctly, different views about the impact of different ethanol petrol blends on engines, which is why the government is conducting what will be the definitive study which will underpin the government's decision.I would like to make a comment on the testing program that is being undertaken in relation to two-stroke engines, including outboard motors. The government expects to have preliminary results of this testing program by the end of the year. The Australian Marine Industries Federation has written to me, advising me of its concerns about the potential impacts of higher ethanol blends on outboard motors. It is important that consumers know what they are buying, and fuel suppliers should ensure that they fully disclose to consumers whether the fuel contains ethanol, whether it is suitable for particular applications, and any potential impact or damaging impact on the performance of engines. I advise boat owners in particular to check operating manuals for manufacturers' recommendations regarding fuel requirements. Boat owners should be very cautious in buying fuel which contains ethanol blends. The government believes that there are potentially very significant benefits that could be gained by the use of ethanol in fuels, but equally that it is very important that the quantum of the blend be appropriate for the engines which are available to consumers, and that is precisely what the government's current scientific study is all about.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, and acknowledge his very strong support for the Nepean campus of the University of Western Sydney. You might be interested to know that that university is described by the New South Wales education minister as being `on the fringe of Sydney'. I am sure the member for Macquarie's constituents will appreciate hearing that. Australia currently has 38 publicly funded universities. The Commonwealth government this year will provide $6.4 billion to those universities - 31 per cent in the form of an operating grant. Eighteen per cent of university revenues will be HECS and 15 per cent will be university research funding. That means that universities this year, with $4 billion of non-government funding, will have total revenues of around $10.4 billion, which is almost $2 billion more than they received when this government came to office in 1996.In relation to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, there are 1,115,317 Australian students and former students who currently owe $8.2 billion to the Australian taxpayer. It should be pointed out to the House that HECS - which is money that is lent by the Commonwealth from hard-working Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university - is actually a cost to the Commonwealth government of $300 million a year. It costs the government $300 million a year because of a 25 per cent up-front discount, a 15 per cent discount for part payments, and also remissions and write-downs for students who are not able to meet their repayments.The Australian higher education sector will be reformed by this government. The four priorities for reform will be equity, diversity, quality and sustain-ability. The President of the Australian Vice-Chan-cellors Committee, Professor Schroeder, was reported in the Sunday Telegraph on 15 September as saying:Put simply, there is widespread consensus within the higher education system, government and the broader community that the current funding and regulatory framework for universities is unsustainable.He said:It is inhibiting institutional growth and diversification and it is beginning to threaten the quality of education that our universities are able to offer.I have found some very similar comments made by, shall I say, a rather muscled-up author. In a tome entitled The enabling state: people before bureaucracy - something that would certainly be supported on this side of the House - the member for Werriwa said:The heavy hand of national regulation is limiting the system's freedom to respond to the new challenges of competition ... Our universities will never be able to realise their potential without greater freedom and diversity ... Governments, of course, cannot mandate or prescribe diversity ... Rather, the Commonwealth needs to give the universities greater power of self-direction and self-governance.What do we know at the moment of the Australian Labor Party's policies in relation to universities? Firstly, last week, the President of the Group of Eight universities argued for $385 million more for research. Immediately, the member for Jagajaga came out and said that the Australian Labor Party would support the $385 million. She was quoted in the Australian newspaper on 19 September as supporting the calls for more funds. Further to that, on Wollongong Radio 97.3 on 3 September this year, when the member for Jagajaga was asked if Labor would fund a place for everyone, she said:The idea that there are 50,000 students around Australia who can't get into universities because there isn't a place, I think is a shocking waste.The total cost of that is $640 million. In fact, the unmet demand is about 10,500. On 4 June this year, she was campaigning for Australian universities to drop domestic fee-paying places in universities. That means that, if you are a student in Bligh Park and you want to get a place in a university that is already full, you get less of a right than a student in Beijing to study in Australia. The cost of dropping those domestic places is $70 million. She also argues that the repayment threshold for HECS - currently $23,242 - should be increased. If you assume that you would go to Knowledge Nation with its $25,000 repayment threshold, that is $266 million over four years. In terms of Labor Party policy so far in relation to Australian universities, we are looking at around $1.12 billion of expenditure. As the member for Jagajaga said the week before last at a financing conference on universities, it is a matter of priorities. She said that the government could reorder its priorities. I am sure the member for Lalor would like to reorganise the priorities of government, were she in government. I think the member for Fremantle would reorganise priorities if she were in government. They would take money out of defence and border protection and put it into universities. I think, as the member for Werriwa has actually said, governments need to look beyond the ideologues.</DOC>

 - It was the term `crisis' that I took particular objection to. I think it is absurd to overstate some variability in house pricing. You chose Melbourne presumably because house prices in Melbourne have risen very rapidly in recent years, I suspect in large part because - if you disregard the current government - after a long period of woeful mismanagement in the 1980s, the Victorian government was put back on the economic tracks by a coalition government for most of the nineties, and Melbourne made some pretty good progress. When we talk about affordability, you have got to look at a number of issues. We could start with unemployment, which is about half of what it was when you left office. It is much easier to afford a house if you have got a job.  - Then you could go to real wage levels, which had been in long-term decline under you -  - but which have risen in real terms by some 10 per cent or thereabouts - by 12 per cent - over the last six years. Then, of course, there is the issue of interest rates. Nothing affects housing affordability more than interest rates. I made it plain yesterday that I in no sense could countenance the idea that there is a crisis in Australian housing. I think that is emotive; it is over the top. It is Labor Party scaremongering.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. Not only is he a very hardworking local member but also he shows his versatility by supporting biotechnology in his electorate. This morning, the member for Hume and I celebrated with Chondrogenesis the awarding of a BIF grant of some $150,000 to that company. The proprietors of that company, Dennis and Nancy White, have developed a line of biotechnology which offers extraordinary opportunities for the treatment of arthritis and also cartilage damage. Cartilage damage in Australia not only relates to football injuries, which I know is very pertinent in this House at the moment, but also can lead to osteoarthritis. The importation of the gene which is developed in the deer's antler offers the opportunity to hasten recovery. In fact, the work that has been done has been so welcomed by the Arthritis Foundation of Australia that their CEO, Bridget Kirkham, said today:We believe this proactive approach towards research by the government should be commended. It is great news for Australians with arthritis.Innovation like this, if proven, provides an opportunity for Australia not only to earn international recognition and cure the debilitating disease of osteoarthritis but also to earn significant export funds. It is just one of 39 projects that we have funded over the announcement this morning of the BIF - some $9.1 million attached to that round. Of course, it is only part of what the federal government do in science and innovation. This year we will spend some $5 billion in this area. That is in stark contrast to the innovation void from those who sit opposite. More importantly, it is a billion dollars a year more than Labor ever spent on science and innovation.</DOC>

 - The first point I would make about what the Prime Minister put on the table last week was that he, in the interests of all Australians wanting to own their own home, has been prepared to think laterally and look for new solutions. He is not imposing any ideas, he is not outlining something that is going to be taken forward as policy; he is talking about a concept which can be worked up by the Menzies Foundation. Why anybody would oppose that, I really do not know. Presumably, this is about trying to say to the voters in Cunningham that you are more serious about home affordability than the coalition. That just does not stack up. As I said before - and I can provide the opposition spokesman on this matter with more information, if he would like it - the figures clearly reveal that, in terms of their asset wealth, purchasing power and income, and in terms of the number of Australians who have incomes, housing affordability in the nineties and particularly under this government has been considerably stronger and healthier than it was under Labor in the 1980s. Mr Speaker, I can assure you that, if I were a home buyer, I would far rather be seeking to purchase a home and pay it off under the coalition's economic management than under Labor's.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question and acknowledge the significant contribution he makes to the government members committee on the environment. The Earth Summit in Johannesburg showcased the key fact that economic performance and environmental performance go hand in hand and that it is growing economies that have the capacity, with modern technology, to address the key environmental pressures. It was the advanced countries at the summit that had air and water cleaner than it was 50 years ago and the countries that have not yet put in place the governance arrangements to encourage investment that were suffering from the choking smog of the Asian brown cloud and the foul water from old, dirty technology. This has been well recognised by researchers looking at the connection between flexible, adaptive and dynamic economies and environmental performance.I notice that Daniel Esty of Yale and Michael Porter of Harvard who investigated the link found that environmental sustainability and a country's competitiveness go hand in hand. In the studies that they did, they demonstrated a correlation of some 72 per cent between these variables. It is, of course, the success of this government in paying off $61 billion of Labor debt and the success of our economic reform program which have enabled us to put billions of dollars into the biggest environmental rescue packages in Australian history - the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan. - In fact, our economic success has enabled us to more than double the Labor Party's expenditure on the environment from the levels it was at when Labor was last in office. Labor's historic problem has been that its inability to manage the economy has meant that it has spent, and squandered in many cases, billions of dollars on ineffective programs to try to hide unemployment rather than being able to invest in the country's major environmental rescues. This is becoming much more difficult for the Labor Party now because the increasing divisions within the party on economic, social and environmental policy mean that the politics of the warm inner glow have taken over from the hard work and the politics of reality and actually addressing policies that might work.Nowhere has this been more clearly demonstrated than in the recent press releases from the member for Wills, whose current press releases identify every evil under the sun as being a result of the fact that the government has determined not to ratify the Kyoto protocol at the present time. He has blamed us for coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef because we have not ratified Kyoto. On Monday he went as far as to use the drought as a reason for ratifying Kyoto. Apparently if we ratify Kyoto, we can break the drought. In fact, he said:By refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, John Howard and John Anderson are cutting the throats of Australian farmers.What does he think Kyoto is? Is it some kind of rain dance? Is this what the Kyoto conga line is all about?The Labor Party has not done the work that the government have done to point the way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have put in place effective programs, and all the Labor Party can come up with is yet another treaty ratification - and it is supposed to solve all the problems that Australia is facing at the present time. What is next? I can see that, if Collingwood does not win the grand final, the member for Wills is going to blame it on not ratifying Kyoto. That is where the Labor Party has got itself to at the present time. Ratifying a treaty that will damage Australian jobs and force Australian industries overseas is not going to help Australian farmers. It is a substitute for doing the hard work which would give the Labor Party some credibility in the area of climate change. At present it has none.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The answer is very simple. Of course, we did in the statement provide a great deal of information but, further than that, it is not the job of the Australian government to declassify British intelligence material; it is the job of the British government. In the extraordinarily unlikely event that the Leader of the Opposition should become Prime Minister of this country -  -  - if he were to declassify British intelligence information and table it in the parliament, it would terminate our intelligence relationship with Britain and I do not propose to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question - it is a serious question and a good question. I know the honourable member has a great interest in these issues and, of course, in foreign policy questions more generally - he learnt in a very good place.The government welcomes the document tabled by Prime Minister Blair yesterday in the British parliament and released publicly as a significant contribution to the case concerning Iraq's threat to international peace and security. I think this document has put beyond reasonable doubt the fact that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction - that he has biological weapons, that he has chemical weapons - and that he intends not only to retain those capabilities but that he intends to use those capabilities.Specifically, I would inform the honourable member that the dossier notes that Iraq has continued to produce chemical and biological agents, has pursued illegal procurement programs of controlled materials and has developed mobile laboratories for military use. It has covertly tried to acquire technology and materials that could be used in nuclear weapons production. If sanctions were removed or proved ineffective, it would take Iraq five years or perhaps more to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon but only one or two years to produce a nuclear weapon if it acquired fissile material from foreign sources. It retained up to 20 ballistic missiles with a range of 650 kilometres capable of carrying chemical or biological warheads and has pursued illegal procurement programs to develop long-range missiles in breach of the United Nations imposed restriction of 150 kilometres. In addition, the dossier reveals preparations by Iraq to conceal evidence of these weapons from renewed inspections.The dossier is based on, amongst other sources, British intelligence collection - they are not the only sources - and the House should be aware that the British intelligence services are particularly extensive and effective. The dossier elaborates on a number of points that I made in my speech to the House last week and, importantly, is consistent with the views of the Australian intelligence community. Of course, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in his earlier question, we obviously have a very close relationship with both the British and the United States intelligence communities. - The Leader of the Opposition wonders why we don't declassify British and American intelligence material. - There are 150 members of this House; I think 149 would be able to work out the answer to that. As the Prime Minister said yesterday after his meeting with Prime Minister Blair, the government warmly welcomes the initiative by the British government to produce the dossier. I foreshadowed yesterday that I would make the dossier available to the House. It is available on the Internet and there are substantial media summaries of it, but let me table it so that members will be able to go to the Table Office and obtain a copy of the document. Whatever members' views may be on this question, I would commend to them real and genuine study of these sorts of documents because, in addition to the issues that I just mentioned, this document has quite extensive analysis of Iraq's simply appalling human rights record. Saddam Hussein's human rights record is, without any doubt whatsoever, one of the very worst the world has seen in a very long time, and this document has very dramatic examples of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that this is a matter of importance and of very great interest to all in the community at a time of considerable challenge in our own region and internationally. Let me first say that Dr Allan Hawke will shortly fulfil a three-year contract as the Secretary of the Department of Defence. He deserves - and I have put this down elsewhere - recognition and appreciation for his role in developing the defence white paper, in taking forward the new Defence Capability Plan and in undertaking major internal restructuring. I also want to say that nobody can have any doubts about the qualities, the depth, the experience - in diplomatic as well as military circles - of his successor, Ric Smith. He is highly regarded and very competent to fulfil the onerous tasks that will be expected of him in his new role.When it comes to our serving men and women, I have no doubt that they know they enjoy the very strong support of the government, I hope of all people in this place, and of the Australian people for the outstanding way in which they have performed in recent years. I think knowing that they have the strong support of the government and the Australian people is important to the defence forces.In addition to that, it is highly appropriate that we mention the recent CDF, Chris Barrie, who fulfilled his role outstandingly, and the new CDF, Peter Cosgrove, and the team around him. You could not ask for people who inspire greater confidence and greater security in their leadership and greater certainty for the future in terms of people knowing that their interests will be well looked after at the same time as the nation looks to them to discharge their very important responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. He has shown a very serious and informed interest in this whole issue of Iraq. I appreciate the way he has approached the whole issue and I know his constituents do.There has been some commentary here and there - not so much in Australia, but elsewhere - that the dossier released by the Blair government yesterday did not contain any new information. This is a slogan that you hear from time to time. Regardless of what documents are produced and what speeches are made, there always seem to be people who say they do not contain new information. I am not sure whether some of the people who make those claims have done a great deal of study.I thought that the honourable member, having asked the question, would be interested to know that it is our assessment that this document does contain additional key evidence which was released publicly for the first time. The House might be interested to know what it is. First of all, in relation to chemical and biological weapons, the document says that Iraq is already taking steps to prevent United Nations weapons inspectors finding evidence of its chemical and biological weapons programs, including through the concealment of documentation. It says that the Iraqi military is able to deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so and that it is willing to do so against its own Shia population. The dossier says that a good deal of the personnel involved in Iraq's earlier chemical and biological weapons programs have remained in the country. It goes on to identify a number of very specific facilities as possibly associated with the production of chemical and biological weapons. My point here is this: I am advised by the Australian intelligence community that none of that material has previously been made public. The Australian intelligence community has also advised me that, in relation to the nuclear weapons program, the dossier reveals - it has not been revealed before - that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Iraq, however, has no active civil nuclear program or nuclear power plants and thus no legitimate use for or reason to acquire uranium. The document also details recent attempts by Iraq to purchase various pieces of equipment potentially useable in a gas centrifuge enrichment program for the production of nuclear weapons.In relation to Iraq's ballistic missile program, the Australian intelligence community advises me that this document, amongst the many things that it has drawn attention to - and of course we spoke about some of themin this House last week - has revealed new information. It revealed that an Indian firm was involved in assisting Iraq's ballistic missile program as well as Iraqi procurement efforts to acquire propellant chemicals for its ballistic missiles from foreign sources.As honourable members know, a lot of the material that was released in the dossier was material that I had alluded to or spelled out in my statement to the House last week. But there was a lot of new material in the speech, and I have given the House some examples of what was completely new. It does put paid to an argument you hear every time any major statement is made on this question of Iraq: that there is no new material. There is a lot of new material coming out.I was asked on a television program last night whether the British should reveal the intelligence sources of this information. Most members of the House would understand that, if the British were to reveal their sources of this information, it would of course destroy their sources, not only as sources but possibly as human beings as well. I do not think it is a reasonable expectation that we would ask the British government to do that.</DOC>

 - In 1991, there was a war against Iraq. The point that this government has been making over and over again - and it is a point entirely relevant to this question - is that the question of a war against Iraq is a hypothetical question. Nobody at this stage has made a decision to take military action against Iraq. One could hypothesise endlessly about the impact of the totality of this issue on oil prices. For example, you could hypothesise that, if there were to be military action taken against Iraq, oil prices would increase. And you could hypothesise that, if that military action were quickly successful and sanctions were lifted against Iraq, or if there was not military action against Iraq but Iraq complied with all of its obligations and disarmed - and this is a point that the House might like to reflect on in relation to the question of the Leader of the Opposition - sanctions would be lifted against Iraq. If sanctions were lifted against Iraq, Iraq would be able to increase substantially its oil production and its oil exports, and that would lead to a very substantial fall, at least on the face of it, in global oil prices. Inevitably there will be some increases in oil prices -  - The question is based on the premise of conflict in Iraq leading to massive increases in oil prices. My point is one that the House might like to reflect on: if Iraq complies with the Security Council resolution and disarms, or if disarmament were to hypothetically take place in some other circumstance, sanctions would be lifted; and, if sanctions were to be lifted, oil prices would fall very substantially.  - Mr Speaker -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I appreciate being asked a question on petrol prices. On Neil Mitchell's program this morning on 3AW, the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Petroleum was asked by Neil Mitchell, `So are we right to be worrying about petrol prices at the moment?' I think the answer to this question by the executive director is relevant to the way the question here was formulated. Mr Nye said, `No, I think at the moment there is a bit of scaremongering out there.' And I think we know who he might be referring to. He went on to say, `But, you know, the supply situation in the world is a little different to what it was 10 years ago.' Obviously the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC provide powers, but at the moment the situation is that there has been some increase in oil prices, no doubt partly driven by concern about conflict in the Middle East. Nevertheless, as I said earlier to the House, Iraq potentially supplies something like 10.9 per cent of the world's oil. That is a very substantial proportion of the world's oil reserves. In the event of sanctions eventually being lifted, I think the market expectation would be a reduction in global oil prices.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and note her very real interest in this matter, given the very vast natural resources in her electorate. I am very pleased that my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage have released today the final report of the National Land and Water Resources Audit, which I think is probably one of the highest, if not the highest, quality documents of its sort in the world.I might have a little moment of pride in this if I may, because it originated with a discovery by me, as a shadow minister in 1995 on a visit to Queensland, that no-one knew what the true state of land clearing was in that state at that time. I was astonished. There was no accurate way of assessing whether it was the 100,000 hectares claimed by some sectors, the million hectares a year claimed by the Greens or the assumption made by the government at the time that it was somewhere between the two; no-one knew. It struck me that it was a good idea to do something about this. So after six years of very hard work we have now seen the delivery of a coalition commitment that provides an independent, comprehensive and nationwide appraisal of Australia's natural resources and their uses - a tremendously valuable resource for the nation.This material summarises the condition and management opportunities for Australia's soils, waters, rivers, estuaries and biodiversity. It will be invaluable in its ability to assist natural resource managers to understand the challenges they face and to identify workable and lasting solutions in a timely way, allowing for efficient deployment of available resources and, I believe, the most economical outcomes as well. It is something that I think will in the future be looked back on as an incredibly important foundation stone in the management of our natural resources right across this vast but ancient and very fragile landscape that we call home. The audit report focuses on rural and remote Australia. Those opposite often proclaim their green credentials, but here is perhaps the most valuable resource material ever put together by a government for the management of our environment and its sustainable use, particularly by the nation's farmers and water users. It focuses on eight key themes or issues - namely, water, salinity, vegetation, rangelands, agriculture, biodiversity, rivers and catchments, and opportunities for natural resource managers.This exercise has cost in the order of $35 million. At the time I remember thinking that was a lot of money for this sort of work. I suspect that in the future we will look back on it and say that it was an absolute bargain. It is likely to do an unbelievable and incalculable amount of good in terms of the efficient and timely management of our resources, not just for us but also for future generations of Australians.</DOC>

 - Yesterday I was asked a question about the revenue implications of any increases in oil and, therefore, petrol prices -  - I did not get it wrong. - I would hardly turn to the Leader of the Opposition for advice on economics! I can absolutely assure the House that, of all the people in this parliament, he would be pretty much the last person I would turn to for that sort of advice. If ever there were an economic illiterate, it would be the man sitting there. - Mr Speaker, the only point I would add to what I said yesterday is that changes in fuel prices, particularly those - as in this case - brought about by increases in global oil prices, have significant impacts right around the economy, and it is very hard to assess what the net revenue impact would be for the Commonwealth. Certainly, Treasury is in no position to make any assessment at this stage about the overall net macroeconomic impact as well as revenue impact of any spike in oil prices. As I explained in answer to an earlier question, oil prices could fall later in the financial year as much as they have increased in the early part of the financial year, and that, amongst other things, is going to depend very much - in fact, overwhelmingly - on how the question of Iraq is ultimately resolved. So to answer a question about the net revenue implications of any spike in oil prices is something that the Treasury is not able to do at this time. But as I pointed out yesterday, on a six-monthly basis under this government, the government produces not just a budget but also a Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and any revenue implications one way or the other, whatever they may be, will obviously be taken into consideration in that Outlook.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I appreciate the support he gives to all the government's Indigenous employment programs. As the House would know, Indigenous unemployment is one of Australia's most intractable problems. Indigenous people comprise some two per cent of our population, some six per cent of Australia's unemployed, some eight per cent of intensive assistance commencements and, I am afraid, just five per cent of intensive assistance outcomes. I am pleased to say that the performance of the Job Network with respect to Indigenous Australians is now improving, and improving quite strongly. The percentage of Indigenous Australians participating in intensive assistance in work three months after leaving the program is 30 per cent higher now than it was 12 months ago. I am also pleased to say that, in the last financial year, the number of Indigenous job matching placements has increased by 30 per cent.In recent times, much Indigenous employment has been confined to jobs with Aboriginal organisations. If reconciliation is to be a reality, we need to see more Aboriginal people finding jobs in the private sector. Since the Indigenous Employment Program commenced in 1999, I can say that my department has negotiated 18,000 structured training and employment program places, and more than 80 per cent of those have been with private sector organisations. Some 6,000 Indigenous Australians have received wage assistance and more than 85 per cent of those have received that assistance to enter private sector jobs. More than 60 major Australian businesses have joined the government's Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment Project, and those companies have negotiated some 4,000 structured training and employment program places with my department.As the member for Leichhardt well knows, my department has just entered a whole of government partnership agreement to be the lead agency coordinating the delivery of federal government services to Indigenous people in Cape York. I am very pleased that this has happened. I take this opportunity to congratulate Noel Pearson for the leadership he has provided, not just to his own people but to every Australian interested in breaking the cycle of disadvantage and despair.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I had a meeting with representatives of the Australian Institute of Petroleum on 21 August 2002. They asked to see me because there was speculation at the time that the government was considering a mandate on the percentage of ethanol that should be included in our liquid fuel mix. They expressed to me their concerns about such a proposal, and subsequently made suggestions as to how the industry might be able to cooperate with the government to achieve our stated election commitment of including up to 350 million litres of ethanol in the fuel mix by 2010.The fuel industry made it quite clear to me that they were unhappy about proposals to incorporate ethanol in the fuel mix. I indicated firmly that the government had made commitments in an election context in that regard. I also made it clear that in the record that my office made of that particular meeting - incidentally, it was recorded in shorthand by a staff member, so it was in considerable detail - there was absolutely no reference to the sorts of statements suggested by Mr Nye. I know that Mr Nye made some comments to the effect that he had taken notes at the meeting. We did not observe him taking notes at the meeting, so they must have been quite brief. He acknowledged that his memo was only sent the following day, so it was obviously reconstructed some time later.In answer to the specific question from the member for Brisbane, let me say that at no time has the Prime Minister or anyone else said to me that decisions in relation to the ethanol mix would be dependent upon the way in which those arrangements affected Manildra. The Prime Minister never said that to me at any time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. The member for Grey represents a very large number of Indigenous Australians in the state of South Australia, many from the central desert areas of the country. He is well aware of the very special needs that they have and, of course, the aspirations of the government to be able to address those matters. Today is a very timely occasion on which to raise these issues because the Commonwealth has been working with local Indigenous people and state and territory governments to develop a new approach that shares responsibility between all of the parties for improving the situation with Indigenous communities around Australia.In April this year, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed to identify up to 10 Indigenous communities to participate in a whole of government approach to improve service delivery and to address those needs. There will be at least one site or project in each state and territory jurisdiction and it is, of course, subject to the agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories as well as the relevant people in the communities in which these programs may be conducted. This new initiative requires that we work as partners - as joint venturers - with communities, non-government agencies, and state and territory governments.As part of this process, we are listening very closely to what communities want and are seeking to address those in ways which are meaningful to them. The approach requires us to move away from a `one size fits all' notion. Government agencies that are bound to deliver programs within their own parameters often do not see appropriate linkages with other programs delivered by other authorities and very often the priorities that communities want are ignored in a process where decisions are made in silos or in isolation.The view of the government in regard to programs and traditional bureaucratic boundaries, which are the main obstacle to getting better outcomes, is that we ought to find new ways of moving around them, and one way in which this has been sought is through these new partnership initiatives. The secretaries of key Commonwealth departments and agencies have been meeting together personally, as have ministers, to oversee the implementation of this initiative. They have agreed to set up sponsors for different projects and have set up a task force that reports to the secretary of my department.At the moment, the communities that will be participating are the subject of discussion and we hope that the Prime Minister, premiers, ministers and chief ministers of the territories will be able to announce some of those developments. But the Prime Minister and Premier Beattie were happy today for the announcement to proceed in relation to Queensland and, as has already been mentioned by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Cape York area has been so identified. The Queensland Premier has made an announcement on that, as has the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in this place and earlier at a joint press conference with me, which was attended by Mr Pearson and Mr Richard Ah Mat representing the Cape York partnerships.I certainly hope that we will be able to make further announcements in a matter of weeks about the other areas in which we are working. It is evidence of a very high level of cooperation between the states, territories, the Commonwealth and Indigenous communities about achieving an integrated approach, a partnership approach, to being able to address the issues. I hope the issues will be addressed in ways in which the communities themselves will be wholly supportive, because they have had a role in determining the way in which those decisions will be implemented and the way in which they might affect them.</DOC>

 - I have not got anything really to add to the answer I gave previously. At that meeting we most assuredly discussed the question of ethanol and petrol mixes. That was the specific reason why the institute asked to speak to me. We discussed a range of issues that were associated with our campaign and our election commitment to deliver a larger percentage of ethanol in our fuel mix. - I said in my answer to the last question that I have no recollection of the Prime Minister ever having discussed with me his attitude to the question of the effect of these sorts of decisions on Manildra. Since he had never discussed it with me, how could I possibly have expressed a view on that matter to the Institute of Petroleum?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and acknowledge his particular interest in the sugar industry and his determination to ensure that the industry has the capacity to grow and prosper in the years ahead. I can report to the House today that, in the company of the Queensland Minister for State Development, the Hon. Tom Barton, and the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Henry Palaszczuk, an agreement was signed between the Commonwealth and the federal government to work cooperatively together to endeavour to achieve a more vibrant and prosperous future for the Australian sugar industry. We have undertaken through this memorandum of understanding to jointly look at ways in which we can encourage innovation in the industry, improve the productivity and profitability of the industry and also take care of the immediate emergency needs of the industry, particularly in providing some welfare support as farmers face the current very difficult situation.The Commonwealth has agreed to provide emergency income support, some assistance for farmers who choose to leave the industry, some support with planting subsidies for their crops and funding for regional initiatives to support industry change and adjustment. On the other hand, the Queensland government has agreed to provide $30 million to assist in regional change management, to look at an innovation fund to support new practices in the industry and also to provide concessional loans for farm build-ups. This package will be largely delivered at a regional level, with close involvement with the local community and local industry. It is absolutely essential that these measures be delivered in cooperation with the sugar industry, and I will be meeting with sugar industry representatives this afternoon to continue that process. Centrelink will deliver the income support payments from 1 October this year. Growers can register their interest in applying for these measures immediately by contacting Centrelink on 1800 050 585. Farmers and others in the industry who have immediate needs to support their families in these difficult times will be able to receive this support from 1 October.It is vital that all proposals to secure the viability of the industry for the future are properly considered at this time. It is obvious that there is potential for the industry to diversify somewhat. There is a range of new products which potentially could provide a new income source for the sugar industry. Ethanol production, bioplastics and a range of chemicals and other products that can be extracted from the sugar industry all offer significant potential to improve the viability of and the opportunities for the sugar industry. The governments have also agreed that there should be a joint approach to regulatory change, including looking at what elements of the Queensland Sugar Act might impede efficiencies or innovation. We are going to look particularly at the production area system, the bargaining system and the acquisition and vesting arrangements. It is vital that all of the proposals to change the acquisition, vesting and ownership arrangements of sugar be considered in this context. In this regard, I particularly acknowledge the honourable member for Dawson, who has put forward a number of innovative proposals, particularly in this area of vesting, which I think are particularly constructive and will be considered as a part of this process. These proposals will be among the issues to be dealt with in determining what arrangements should be put in place for the industry in the future. Her proposals are quite radical and therefore important in this context. They will undoubtedly provide an important element in the consideration of the future arrangements for the industry. There will be a further communique to be signed on the legislative change issues once the details have been agreed on how we can effectively secure the regulatory framework necessary for a vibrant and innovative industry.The industry has faced considerable difficulties over recent times. There is a determination by the state and federal governments to work constructively together to achieve a better future for sugar farmers and the regional communities in Bundaberg, up the Queensland coast and into New South Wales and in Western Australia where the sugar industry has been so important and has contributed so much to our nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and recognise his enthusiasm on behalf of, particularly, the small and medium size enterprises in his electorate of Dobell in terms of getting into the export marketplace. It is well known that the coalition's policy at the last election was to target the doubling of the number of exporters in Australia by 2006. To achieve that strategy we have embarked upon a number of policy objectives: firstly, our very aggressive and ambitious stance in terms of opening up markets across the world and, in particular, removing impediments to our exports across the world; and, secondly, but just as important, our trade promotion strategy through Austrade. The new managing director and the board have undertaken a review of the offshore structure of the organisation, announced today, refocusing into the critical areas of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Indian Ocean, North Asia and the Americas - key areas for focus with regional management.We also announced, in the election, our commitment to increase the number of TradeStart offices. In fact, it will go beyond our commitment made during the election campaign, going from the 24 offices that did exist through to 51 offices - and I know that the member for Dobell makes good use of the office in his area on the central coast in terms of assisting exporters who want to get in for the first time. So we are looking at increasing business community awareness of the benefits of export. We are looking at new exporter development programs targeting so-called `born globals' in the biotech, ICT and services sector and bringing potential customers to Australia to interface with potential exporters. The strategy being undertaken by the government and Austrade is about increasing the capacity of our exports, which will increase the value and volume of our exports, which will obviously add significantly to the contribution that exporting has already made to the jobs growth in Australia over the last six years of one million jobs.</DOC>

I also accept that Indigenous unemployment would be even higher but for the 30,000 or so Indigenous people who are employed under Community Development Employment Program jobs; I accept that. But the last thing I want to do is make the Indigenous unemployment situation worse rather than better, and that is why I do not propose to tamper with the CDEP scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. Not only is he a great supporter of regional Australia but he also takes a great interest in the development of resources in regional Australia and has a very significant mineral sands province currently under exploration in the northern part of his electorate.ABARE predicts that exports of resources and petroleum will rise by four per cent in the next financial year. In terms of dollars, increasing to some $60 billion worth of exports, accounting - as I am sure the Minister for Trade would agree - for about 40 per cent of our exports. This government is keen to ensure that those exports continue to grow, and we are currently investigating a number of ways in which we can improve and increase the amount of exploration done in Australia. I am pleased to announce today that we have in fact released six new exploration permits for the resource industry, which will result in an extra $100 million in exploration being done in Australia over the period ahead. - Mr Speaker, if I am going too quickly for the member opposite, I will slow down. - We have announced today the approval of six exploration permits. That is not policy; that is action. That is worth $100 million to Australia's economy in terms of spending on exploration. Am I going too quickly? -  - Yes, Mr Speaker. We do have an action agenda, and I know that those opposite would aspire to have even half as much policy as we have on the resources sector. They would aspire just to have action, let alone an action agenda. Whilst they sit there looking for anything that would make up a policy -  - Go and read the press release, Member for Hunter. - I thank the member for Hunter for drawing my and the media's attention to my press release today. I am sure, in view of the fact that it will create $100 million worth of exploration in Australia, that it will now get an excellent run in tonight's media and, on that basis, merely highlight what the Howard government is doing to ensure that Australia's mineral and resources sector moves forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would draw his attention in good faith to the reality that, if he is really serious about eliciting information in this place, he might like to note that I am not actually the minister responsible for telecommunications, nor am I the spokesperson in this place for telecommunications. -  - No, Mr Speaker, if this place is to be taken seriously -  - No, I was not accusing you of that.  - So, Mr Speaker, I just say that those sorts of questions are important and deserve some technical elucidation. It is true that Telstra does pair lines; there is no doubt about that. There is no doubt too that in certain circumstances it can have an impact on data speeds, as I understand the technology. - That does not alter the fact of some general comments that I think are very important to make in this place. Firstly, we - and not the Labor Party, in 13 years in government - have put in place a set of universal service obligations and customer service guarantees which give consumers rights that they can exercise, that they can insist that Telstra, for example -  - To respond - unwisely, I suppose - to the interjection, they can go to Telstra and demand their rights to certain data speeds. It would also -  - You can insist on certain data speeds in rural and regional areas in particular. It is also important to make the point, though, that the reality is that charges for many of these services are coming down -  - and that in relation to line service charges -  - This is the next point I want to make: in the line rentals issue, it has been known for a long time - supported by the ACCC and Allan Fels, supported by telecommunications experts everywhere -  -  - Mr Speaker, they are not interested in my elucidating these facts at all. - No, I have not. I meant, when I referred to the ACC, the ACCC. I make the point -  -  - If they are interested in information, Mr Speaker, I am prepared to provide them with quite a bit. The fact is that the ACCC and the Productivity Commission have both argued strongly for removal of what is known as the access deficit, because it will enable more competition for access to lines. Competition brings down charges and improves services. I know that is novel to the neo-socialists opposite who now want to go back to the public ownership of -  -  - Any day now we will see them wanting to take over public ownership of Qantas again, and then it will be the Commonwealth Bank, and it will go on and on and on. But competition improves services and brings down prices. The ACCC and the Productivity Commission have both highlighted the need to remove what is known as the access deficit, and we have agreed that that ought to happen over four years. The really important point of all of this is that the Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition more generally, has known about these price increases for some five months. Not a word was breathed - because they knew the policy argument - until the Leader of the Opposition found his way down to a certain seat, which he is a bit worried about, on the east coast of New South Wales. He went out and made a hero of himself saying that he would save battlers money -  -  - He made a hero of himself by saying that he would disallow these line rental increases because it would save battlers money. It will not; it will not save them any money. In reality, if he were to succeed, he would remove the opportunity for a new competitor that wants to provide services to the people in that seat by providing easier access to the lines in the area. This is political opportunism of the first order, and the people of Cunningham will have no opportunity to benefit at all from the Leader of the Opposition's misplaced heroism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Howard government's oceans policy is recognised as a world-leading policy. At the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, Australia put forward a number of initiatives to improve the management of the world's oceans and recognised and gained international recognition for the fact that these are critical for global food security and for sustaining economic prosperity.There is no doubt at all that oceans management would not have achieved the recognition it did at the world summit had it not been for the leadership that Australia provided. As a result, we have made significant gains in the areas of marine biodiversity conservation, sustainable fishing, pollution alleviation, information development and sharing and strengthening the governance of the world's oceans. The summit partnerships that we have now put in place involve some 24 nations, including countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, Japan, Norway and of course our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.In this context I am also very pleased to be able to announce to the House that, overnight in Bonn, at the meeting of the convention on the conservation of migratory species, the Howard government was successful in its campaign to have listed under the convention six species of great whale. The Antarctic minke, the brooders, the fin, the pygmy right, the sei and the sperm whale are now listed under the convention. These listings open the door for Australia to begin consultations with our South Pacific neighbours to develop a memorandum of understanding on the conservation of all listed mammals under the convention that can be found at various times during their migrations in the South Pacific. Such an MOU would be the first agreement in the region to specifically assist the conservation of these whales and other mammals under the convention.I am also very proud to be able to announce that today, with the Lord Howe Island Commonwealth waters management plan coming into effect, the Howard government has put in place statutory management plans for all 20 Commonwealth parks and reserves. The completion of a proper management regime for all the Commonwealth parks has now finally overcome the neglect of Commonwealth parks and reserves that occurred under Labor during their 13 years in office. In office they were not prepared to do the hard work, and they are not prepared to do the hard work now.Take greenhouse. Greenhouse is another example where the Howard government is prepared to do the hard grind to reach the 108 per cent target, while Labor seems to think that ratifying an international treaty is all that it takes - as if it is some kind of magic wand - and that no hard work is required. That is the difference. This is a government that is prepared to address these issues - to do the work - while on the other side of the House we have an opposition which is simply not prepared to do the hard policy work to have any credibility whatever. While the Leader of the Opposition concentrates on party factions and trying to deal with union domination of the party and the Labor Party is looking to its past, the Howard government is looking to the future and putting in place the policies that will protect Australia's environment.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for her maiden question and I am very happy to answer it on behalf of Senator Amanda Vanstone, who has carriage of this area. Certainly, if standard 9 is disallowed the effect is that there will be no wage standard for business services on which we believe that the government can act on wages. No person with a disability will gain from this approach for the reason why you are objecting to it. - Some of the leading business services already have wage assessment processes in place that satisfy standard 9. - I am sure he is very interested in this. Some use the supported wages system designed for open employment and others have developed similar approaches of their own better suited to their employment environment. We are developing a new pro rata wage assessment tool. We hope to have this in place by March 2003. We believe that, if this is accepted, we could have it operational as quickly as possible.It is interesting because the model of this tool is actually being supported by some of the leading advocates in the disability sector - and you know this - from ACROD, from the National Caucus of Disability Consumer Organisations, and from the ACTU and from relevant Commonwealth agencies. So I am a bit surprised that you have such resistance to this new tool that we are developing.Nevertheless, unlike the supported wages system, the new tool will include both competency and productivity components, so it will provide links to training and career advancement. It will be also used to train and accredit assessors. We do believe this is an appropriate step. There has been a long process of reform within disabilities, particularly when it comes to the business services review. We do believe there needs to be flexibility within that system, but ultimately our objective remains the same - that is, giving the best opportunity to those people who have disabilities, whether it is in supported employment or whether it is through the business services review.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Corangamite for his keen interest in the Green Corps project. Why shouldn't he be interested? In his electorate, there have been a number of teams operating. In particular, he has brought to my attention one very successful project which I would like to tell the House about. That is the Western District Lakes Ramsar and High Value Wetlands Restoration Project at Colac. This is an excellent example of where the Green Corps team has been working to advance the outcome of a better environment.I am very happy to state that the Green Corps project, a coalition government signature project, has been extended to the year 2005. I was also happy to announce quite a few weeks ago that the successful bidder for the $69 million, three-year Green Corps project was Greening Australia, which has done a wonderful job in partnership with Job Futures - and there are some interesting characters in Job Futures. We welcome them. I also would like to pay tribute - and it is important to do this - to Conservation Volunteers Australia, which had the project since its inception and did a terrific job. - We wish them well, and I know they are doing many other projects in Green Reserve and the like.We stated as soon as we got into government in 1996 that we would introduce the Green Corps project. I would like to thank the Minister for the Environment and Heritage at the time who was a great champion of Green Corps. Indeed, it has probably been our most successful project that has engaged young people. Why shouldn't it be? That is a very good question. It was executed by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and advanced by all members of the coalition.There are three key attributes of the program that I would like to acknowledge to the House. It is giving young Australians the opportunity to develop more skills and an interest in the environment. That is a worthy cause. It is geared towards young Australians between the ages of 17 and 20. The sheer popularity of the program demonstrates its success; demand consistently outstrips supply. Another of the Green Corps' attributes is that, for the first time, these young Australians are given active training in, for example, bush regeneration and habitat protection. It gives them 134 hours of accredited training, which I know the Minister for Education, Science and Training is very keen about. - If they continue with it, they can use that training component to go onto further education. Plus, they get paid a training allowance of up to $300 a week. This is a very good program of the coalition government. The best outcome is for the environment. Since its inception, over 8,200 young Australians have gone through the program. There have been 700 projects through which we have planted four million trees, done 2,000 kilometres of fencing, weeded 30,000 hectares, planted five tonnes of seeds - there are a lot of seeds on that side of the House - and established 16,000 kilometres of walking tracks. Do not just take my word for it. Let me quote a Green Corps participant:Greencorps gave me the motivation, the independence and a sense of self-esteem that I had lost somewhere along the way.He went on to say:Before this opportunity presented itself, I was wasting my days and watching them roll past in front of me.That is a bit like what the Australian Labor Party are doing at the moment, isn't it?The member asked: are there any alternatives? From this side of the House, the answer is simply no. Indeed, they have shown very little enthusiasm or support for this project. Their silence condemns them. - As the Acting Prime Minister suggests, I am sure there are ample opportunities for members of the opposition to participate in some Green Corps projects. I suggest that they are perhaps a little bit old and that maybe the Green Reserves might be more suitable. I would like to acknowledge the work of Conservation Volunteers Australia and the fine work of all of those young Australians who are participating in Green Corps, which is a wonderful Liberal-National Party initiative.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think he would understand that we naturally would not go into the details of the military to military consultations we have with other countries. Suffice it to say that the government has been frank and open in saying that we have had military to military consultations with the United States in the course of this year - obviously we have over many years. The fact is that the United States have not asked us to participate in any military conflict against Iraq. They haven't even made a decision to do it. If they were to decide to take military action, no doubt they would choose the best path they imagine it would take to achieve their objectives, but I expect they would not be announcing those plans too publicly to anybody, including the United States Congress. I think the House would understand that it would be inappropriate to go into the details of military to military consultations. I remind the House that in the event that the United States decide to take military action, and if in those circumstances they decide to invite Australia to participate in that military action, the cabinet and the government will consider the issue. The government, having considered the issue, will no doubt also ensure that there is appropriate debate in the parliament and in other public fora in Australia.</DOC>

 - In taking up the theme of the preamble of the honourable member's question, I am happy to inform the House that I hope the Brisbane Lions win.Opposition members - Hear, hear! - I am glad members opposite agree with me, yet again, particularly the member for Griffith. The International Monetary Fund has released its world economic outlook assessment overnight, as honourable members may be aware. After a downturn in the world economy in 2001, the International Monetary Fund expects a gradual recovery this year, 2002, and also next year, 2003. But the IMF expect the pace of global recovery to be slower than had been previously forecast when they published forecasts in April of this year. In particular, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2002 and then by 3.7 per cent in 2003. Growth of the world's advanced economies is expected to be slower, at 1.7 per cent in 2002 and 2.5 per cent in 2003. Importantly, the IMF identifies the pace of economic recovery in the United States as a critical factor in achieving stronger world economic growth, but the outlook in the United States is clouded by uncertainties, volatility on share markets, which honourable members will be aware of, and prospects of below trend growth in domestic demand going not just through this year but well into 2003. Despite these heightened risks and uncertainties to the world economy, the IMF has delivered a very positive, very upbeat assessment of the Australian economy. Our GDP growth, according to the IMF, was amongst the highest of industrialised countries in 2001. What is particularly relevant is that the IMF attributes this to supportive macro-economic policies, a highly competitive exchange rate and higher housing wealth. The IMF predicts that the Australian economy will perform strongly in 2002 and 2003, that we will have moderate inflation and that there will be further declines in our unemployment rate. This assessment of our economy, consistent with previous assessments also by the IMF, is extremely promising. This is a great credit to the government's performance and to its management of the economy - its continuing commitment to taxation reform, to sound and sensible fiscal policies, and to ensuring that we get our budget into good shape, which has been an important contribution to Australia having lower interest rates and very positive in terms of economic activity. So at the end of the day this government can be very proud of the extremely high marks and the excellent report that it, and Australia overall, have been given by the International Monetary Fund. As the IMF has pointed out, Australia's recent good economic performance has been achieved despite the large number of external difficulties that we have had to weather. So it is a great credit to the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It goes to some matters that I think are very important for Australia at the moment. I note at the outset that the Prime Minister did not unilaterally reject the brigadier's remarks, nor did the Minister for Defence. Mr Speaker, it is a serious matter; I assume you would like it taken seriously, and I have to say I did. I should at the outset note that I do know Brigadier Jim Wallace, as probably quite a few people in this place do, and I have a high regard for him. I would also note that I certainly believe that the Prime Minister was justified in rejecting the assertion put to him by someone in the media, as I understand it, that Australia was `perilously underprepared for war'. He rightly rejected that. This is the government that have taken forward a white paper process which has been widely acclaimed. We have massively increased Defence expenditure. In fact, the Defence Capability Plan proposes expenditure of some $50 billion over some 160 projects, or phases of projects, over coming years as we prepare for our defence future. We think this is very important.There is something else that is perhaps easily overlooked. This government and the Prime Minister have set up the National Security Committee, which is an extremely effective mechanism. It meets regularly, it considers matters in great depth and it coordinates policy responses between the government, the military, military bureaucracy and our intelligence and strategic authorities. I think that works very well. The Prime Minister also, rightly and very importantly, made the point that we do not send our serving men and women into theatres that they are not equipped for. It is beyond the remit of the Australian community and of a mid-sized - although very strong - economy to prepare our people for activities in every theatre across the globe. Having said that, as Senator Hill has acknowledged - as I am sure the PM would acknowledge and as I do - we are now from time to time seeing ourselves engaging in theatres that we might once have not foreseen. To that end, as the Minister for Defence noted, we are from time to time stretching the troops and stretching the equipment. The NSC process helps us to get this right, helps us to make the right judgments.I also want to tell the House that, because I took this matter very seriously - I think it is important; it does concern Australians - I spoke to the CDF shortly before question time. He made the point that he has considered carefully, and that the military have today considered carefully, what Brigadier Wallace had to say. He noted their very high respect for their former colleague and said that they do take on board his contributions; that they do not dismiss them. He did make the observation that the brigadier has for a long time held a different perspective on the development of strategy; he felt very strongly about that and, indeed, it is part of the reason he is no longer with the Australian Defence Force, as he has said. The CDF also made the point that Australian service personnel have delivered time and time again on behalf of the Australian people. They deserve great credit for it. They, I think, very strongly support General Peter Cosgrove, the CDF, and the heads of the Navy, the Air Force and the Army.The final comment I would make is that I think issues of morale are at stake. They are very important. We want the Defence personnel to feel appreciated. This was brought home to me the other day when I attended a function, at which a lot of Defence families were present, with my wife, who is the Patron of the Australian Defence Families Association. Quite a few people at that function said that they did not remember feeling so appreciated by the broader Australian community and the government. I think that is important. Your question is an important one; it deserves consideration. I think it is important that we note that the government seeks to be wise and sensible in these matters. The Defence Force is well led, and I believe the serving personnel appreciate very much the actions of the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of these claims that Australia's waterfront performance is limited by the ability of the stevedoring workers. Those claims have been made repeatedly by the unions that represent the waterfront workers and by their mates in this place, the Australia Labor Party, who consistently told us that, in the Australian context, our reform objectives of achieving 25 container movements on average across our five major ports were unachievable - that it could not be done. I think that really was pitching to the lowest common denominator. But the government pressed ahead with our reform agenda, and towards the end of 2000 we achieved our target of around 25 movements on average across our five major container ports. It has consistently improved since then. I am delighted to be able to tell the House today that the latest Waterline shows that national crane rate productivity in the June quarter of this year increased to 26.9 containers per hour. The Labor Party and the union movement said it could not be done. When we came to government, it was 16 movements an hour; today, it is good enough for 27 movements an hour.The question also asked me to consider whether or not there were further impediments to transport efficiency improvements, particularly in relation to seafaring matters, and there are. I am afraid the MUA, the Maritime Union of Australia, pays scant regard to the interests of people who depend on the transportation industry for their jobs. The point was not missed this week by none other than Mark Crosdale, the Secretary of the Northern New South Wales Branch of the Transport Workers Union. In an article on MUA action in relation to the ship Wallarah in the Newcastle Herald - which the member for Paterson might occasionally read; perhaps that is why his attention was drawn to this matter - Mr Crosdale wrote:The reality is that the ship - which is being sold by ANL - had to go because it was simply too expensive considering the reduced amount of coal now coming from southern Lake Macquarie.He also wrote:... transport costs mean the difference between life and death for small mines.I would add to that: to all businesses, particularly small businesses. He made the comment that `the 50 jobs at Chain Valley and a further 40 jobs involved in transporting the coal' were of critical importance and would be lost without improving waterfront and shipping efficiency. There is a union representative who clearly understands where the best prospects for jobs in Australia lie, and efficient transport is a very important part of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Forrest, who is a member from Western Australia, is vitally interested in the protection of our borders and whether or not the efforts the government have been involved in have been successful. In that context, I can certainly confirm that next week in Geneva I will be raising some of these issues when I am participating in the executive committee meeting of the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. This government have taken a strong stance against people-smuggling, and we have done that for a very good reason: the potential that these sorts of operations have to undermine the integrity of our migration program but, more importantly, to undermine the integrity of the international protection system.The messages that have come from the strong stand we have taken are having an impact. The fact is that, in Sri Lanka - quite recently, in published news reports - there has been considerable discussion and publication of the penalties that have been imposed as a result of conviction of people for people-smuggling. Sentences of up to five years jail have been imposed. That is obviously having an important impact on the willingness of people to be involved in people-smuggling. The Sri Lankan media has also carried stories about the arrests of 22 major smugglers by Sri Lankan investigation authorities, about directives by the government to crack down on smuggling and on the potential of people using smugglers to try to achieve unlawful migration results. The fact that a vessel that had originated in Sri Lanka was located in Dili - where the UNHCR dealt with any asylum claims and where people were able to be returned to Sri Lanka - also received substantial coverage.This of course sends a very powerful signal to people who may seek to use smugglers. It gives me a great deal of confidence that, as a result of the range of measures we have implemented, for almost 12 months we have had no unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia. That is a very significant and changed circumstance. Most countries around the world would like to have a situation where movements have dropped from of the order of 4,000 to nil - a 100 per cent reduction. The fact is that it gives me a great deal of confidence to be able to speak internationally about what that means for Australia. Primarily, it has meant that, last year, offshore resettlement of refugees who are unsafe where they are and have no prospect of being able to return safely home has been increased substantially. The refugee and humanitarian program offshore was taking 8,400 people. Without further boat arrivals I believe that, this year, the numbers will be between 10,000 and 12,000 people. That is a very significant change.One should never lose sight of the fact that you have a greater range of options to help those who are most vulnerable if you are able to ensure that those who are wealthy enough to engage people smugglers are not able to achieve their outcomes. It is certainly the case that we ought to be able to choose who we help on the basis of need rather than having people chosen for us by organised crime.In leading Australia's delegation to the executive committee meeting next week, I will continue to press the very strong position we have taken: that the international protection system requires new and creative solutions and that the impact of secondary movements - that is, people moving from situations where they are safe in order to get a better outcome - is something the UNHCR has to address in a very positive way. I have been raising those issues internationally for some three or four years now. At the meetings of the Excom in January, where we reaffirmed our commitment to the treaty dealing with refugees, I made it very clear that the executive committee had to deal with secondary movements. The fact is that that message is now getting through. In the speech to European ministers recently by Commissioner Lubbers, there is now a willingness to reach agreement on secondary movements relating to refugees and asylum seekers. In other words, the UNHCR is saying that it wants to be part of the solution in relation to dealing with these issues.We are in a powerful position because we have been able to demonstrate that you can influence these issues. This is not us saying, `We've got a problem; please help us.' This is us saying, `We had a problem; it has been substantially addressed.' That is not to say that we will not see future attempts to reach Australia without authority, but we had a problem and it has been addressed. We are in a position to work constructively with governments in countries of first asylum and we are in a position to work in relation to push factors. I will continue to highlight the importance of regional approaches - such as the Bali process, in which Australia has been involved - in building cooperation on these issues. I conclude by saying that I will, at that meeting, also take the opportunity to speak with a wide range of ministers and senior officials - including Commissioner Lubbers and the newly appointed High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio de Mello - to continue a constructive dialogue for these issues as we strive for solutions to what is a very large and global problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do not think it can really be seriously challenged that the government, from the Prime Minister down, take very seriously the nation's defence and strategic interests. I do not think it can be seriously challenged that we take seriously the morale, the equipping, the resourcing and the training of our defence personnel. I do not think, either, that you can take seriously any challenge to the credibility of those people who ultimately command Australia's forces.I - and, I think, most Australians - view the current CDF, Peter Cosgrove, as a veritable rock of Gibraltar in uncertain times, with a proven track record. I acknowledge Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie as a man whom I respect enormously, and also Lieutenant Peter Lay of the Army. In the case of the Air Force, I know and have worked quite closely with Air Marshal Angus Houston. They are a group of people in whom I have enormous confidence. Any suggestion that they are not capable of providing sound advice, strong leadership and enormous stability at a time when the nation looks for those things ought to be dismissed as what I can only describe as the opportunism I see it to be.I am asked a question about impropriety, which I presume is in relation to the claims made in the Daily Telegraph today and the dossier on the Courier-Mail web site that senior DSD staff have acted improperly. I do not take those claims lightly. I do make the observation that there are channels for staff from the intelligence agencies to have any grievances dealt with. I have touched on it very briefly with the Minister for Defence and I will undertake to touch on it again with him. If it is appropriate for the government to take any further action in regard to referring those matters, then we will do so. But I do make the point that there are normal channels through which these matters can be pursued.Let me recap: I believe that we have every reason to believe that the processes put in place by the government for the management of defence strategic and intelligence matters through the NSC, by the leadership of the defence forces themselves and by the commitment of the government from the Prime Minister down ensure that our troops and our serving personnel are well equipped and well trained and are not sent into theatres - I have made the point in the previous answer that we cannot equip our people for every theatre across the globe; the globe is a big place. Australia is not the biggest of countries and we cannot do that. We carefully assess our personnel and the assets they have and where they might be able to make a contribution when we have to make a contribution in the national interest. We do not send them to areas where we believe their health and wellbeing would be exposed to unnecessary risk. We do not do that to our serving personnel in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I can inform the House that there are many government offices in Barton, which is perhaps the most sought after CBD office location in Canberra. One of these government offices is actually Centenary House, thanks to a deal negotiated between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party. Thanks to this sweetheart deal, the rent paid by the Australian taxpayer to the Australian Labor Party is now $845 per square metre per month. I can inform the House that more office space has just become available in Barton; in fact, office space has just become available for lease in Centenary House itself. I wonder what the asking rent for this office space is? Remember that the rent which the taxpayer is giving to the Labor Party is $845 a month. Would it be $600 a month per square metre? No. It is not $500 a metre. It is not $400 a metre. It is $320 a metre, which means that the Australian Labor Party is ripping off the taxpayer to the tune of $525 per metre per month. This means a $36 million free gift from the Australian taxpayer to the Labor Party over the life of this deal. It is a rolled gold rip-off. It is the ultimate rort. It amounts to theft from the Australian people. -  - As I was saying, this amounts to a rolled gold rip-off; it is the ultimate rort. It is the equivalent of theft from the Australian people and it is completely supported by the Leader of the Opposition who, by his support for this rip-off, has demonstrated that not only is he not fit to lead a political party but he will never be fit to lead the country.</DOC>

 - I have checked to the extent that the minister believes that what he said has not been understood accurately and he will seek to make an explanation at the end of question time. It highlights again that one should never take for granted that the `assumptions' made by the Labor Party when they roll out these questions can be relied upon. I got one the other day that purported to have the Prime Minister `encouraging' the banks to use the First Home Owners Scheme irresponsibly to leverage new homeowners into homes that they could not afford. -  - The relevance is that you ought never take what the ALP claims to be the statements of others to be accurate. When I went away and had a look at this, it was drawn to my attention that, at the time when the Prime Minister was supposed to have made that claim, the Prime Minister had actually written a letter to the Australian which I think is worth quoting. - Mr Speaker, the relevance is that it is quite apparent in this place that you cannot rely on the integrity of questions asked made on assumptions by the Labor Party - questions which are often simply misleading or untrue, let alone inaccurate. The Prime Minister actually wrote a letter to the Australian in relation to the First Home Owners Scheme in which he specifically made it plain that banks should respect proper lending policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. He has spent most of his adult life supporting trainees and apprentices, particularly Cumberland Industries in his electorate. He is a great credit to employers and their trainees.This morning I announced the outcome of an election commitment made by the government before last year's election. After six months of detailed work, I have announced that we have changed the arrangements which enable employers to take on trainees and apprentices - in particular, employer incentives. Two hundred and sixty-nine organisations were consulted and 100 submissions were received. What I announced this morning is very good news for employers because it will cut the amount of red tape that they have to go through to take on apprentices and they will also find that they will be dealing with a greatly simplified system. The government has announced that it is consolidating the employer payments so that there will be an increase in the commencement payment and a significant increase in the completion payment, with a progression payment being distributed between the two. Twenty per cent of the progression payment will support employers when they take on an apprentice and 80 per cent of the progression payment will be payable to them when they finish the training for that apprentice. In addition, employers in non-metropolitan areas and rural and regional Australia will now find that they will get their regional incentive when they take on a trainee or an apprentice. That means an extra $1,000 plus GST when they take on a trainee, particularly with skill shortages.I know the member for Grey, the member for Hume and many members on this side representing regional and rural seats will welcome the fact that the government is increasing the living away from home allowance for apprentices and also extending that to the second year to make sure that young apprentices do not leave their training when they have to move away from home. The government is also recognising the importance of supporting mature age workers. When an employer takes on a person who is over the age of 45, who is unemployed, has been made redundant or is not in the labour market, an extra $825 will be paid to the employer and another $825 will be paid when they finish their training. Further, the government is also making sure that group training companies that are on a not-for-profit basis go onto the same basis as everybody else and get a completion payment when their trainee or apprentice finishes their training.Today is also a very good day for parents of young apprentices and trainees because the National Centre for Vocational Education Research has announced that the latest figures to the end of the June quarter show that 362,000 Australians are in training and apprenticeships. That is an increase of 15 per cent over the last year. That means around 2.4 per cent of working age Australians are now in apprenticeships and training. It also ought not be lost on the parents of Australia that one-third of teenage full-time employment is now in apprenticeships and training. The other good news - I think the member for Grayndler might even be interested in this - is that completions increased 27 per cent in the last year. Completions have gone to 107,000. Australian employers and the parents of young apprentices and trainees can be quite pleased with what I have announced this morning.What needs to be understood is the pattern of growth in relation to apprenticeships and training over the last decade or so. What I am holding is a graphical representation of that position. You will notice that, under this government, the rate of growth for apprentices and trainees has substantially accelerated. In fact, in 1995, at the trough of this graph, when the Australian Labor Party was in government, the percentage of Australian working age population in training was the lowest in three decades, at 1.1 per cent of the working age population.The question I ask myself is: why is it that this year the Australian Labor Party, which purports to represent working men and women in this country and the parents who want to get their kids into apprenticeships and training, has asked me multiple questions about universities but not one single question about apprenticeships or training? What about the 70 per cent of kids who do not go directly from school to university, who predominantly are going into apprenticeships and training? The Labor Party needs to remember what the priorities of Australia are. Every career choice and educational choice is important. One is no more important than the other. The day the member for Grayndler asks me a question about it is the day I know I get a lottery ticket from the member for Werriwa. And the member for Kingston knows that the way to get on in the Labor Party and get a promotion is to show no interest at all in apprenticeships. I table the graph.</DOC>

But I had no knowledge of, no interest in and no involvement in anything that Ian MacDonald did as a solicitor or anything that he did in the conduct of his mortgage business. Obviously, I deeply regret what Ian MacDonald did, as any Australian would. I deeply regret it, as I am sure he does now. Ian MacDonald has faced the courts and is now appropriately paying a very heavy price for his crime. I really do think that the parliament has sunk to a new low when we have these sorts of questions.

 - I thank the member for his question. I very much thank him for his support for the various initiatives that this government has put in place to assist Indigenous people. The initiative in question is a response to Aboriginal people who tell us that they are tired of what they call the seagull syndrome - that is to say, government officials flying in, fidgeting around, flying out and then saying that they cannot address the problem because it is not really within their portfolio. In 10 regions, starting with Cape York, the government is designating particular portfolios to act as lead agencies responsible for the coordination of all federal government services delivered to Indigenous people in those areas. I am pleased to say that my department is basing four additional staff in Cairns, including one SES level officer, to ensure that this initiative works.This is a grassroots partnership between the federal government, the Queensland state government and local Indigenous leaders. It is a response to the work of Noel Pearson, whose analysis of welfare dependency and how to beat it has been an abject lesson in national leadership. I am pleased that when this was announced yesterday Noel Pearson said:Cape York is really privileged to start off with this very unique situation of having complete support from State and Commonwealth governments to a common direction and a common policy.Ritchie Ahmat, Noel Pearson's successor at the Cape York Land Council, called this a huge step forward. The Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, said:I am delighted the Department of Employment will lead the federal government's effort because jobs and economic development are intrinsic to improving life in these communities.I am very proud to be involved with this. To be honest, I feel a bit humble to be involved with Noel Pearson, who really has shown extraordinary leadership to all Australians. I commend this initiative to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. I am aware of the report that the member refers to which is the Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index constructed by the international management consultancy at Kearney. That report shows that Australia ranks as the 10th most desirable destination for foreign direct investment in 2002. This is unambiguously good news for Australia. It means that the policy settings of our government are on target and that is reinforced by comments in the report. The report states that Australia was a top 10 destination because of tax reform and the sound macroeconomic environment that has been established. Obviously, that has been the result of low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment, and environment and policy settings that have been created by this government. Our reform agenda over the past few years has created a very strong and stable economy within Australia but every single one of those measures - it must be said and put on the record - that have fed into creating Australia as one of the top 10 investment destinations in the world has been opposed every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party. Every reform measure that has created the robust economic situation we have in Australia today has been opposed by the Labor Party.Because we are a major destination for investment, we see companies investing in Australia, creating regional headquarters for the South-East Asian region here, generating jobs. One classic example is a company that was represented in Australia during the Olympic Games in Sydney - Infogram Entertainment of France. They were here during the Olympics and were impressed by the economic climate. Australia is now their regional base for expansion into Asia. They have invested $25 million into their headquarters here and created 160 ICT jobs in Australia - a French company investing in the electorate of Sydney. I am sure the member for Sydney would appreciate that company establishing in her electorate. The report states that we are attractive because not only is our economy strong but also the political risk is low. They know that ours is a politically safe environment, that we have stable government and that the sound economic management being delivered by the coalition government has put us in the top 10 destinations for investment across the world.</DOC>

 - To the tremendous gratitude of former Ansett workers, this government put in place a scheme to protect their statutory and community standard entitlements. Under that scheme, 13,000 workers have received $330 million at an average of $26,000 each and about a quarter of those workers have received 100 per cent of their entitlements. This is a great scheme which the government put in place to protect workers left in the lurch because of the failure of the company. When we put the scheme in place, we said, with this as with other entitlement protection schemes, that the government, having paid out the money or having ensured that the money was paid out, would then stand in the shoes of the worker for the purpose of recovering money from the administration. So of course, to protect the taxpayer, we will try to get back as much money as we can from the administration. It is quite simple; you would expect us to do no less to protect the taxpayers of this country.So far, I understand we have collected some $120 million dollars by way of the ticket levy, which means that the federal taxpayer is still $210 million out of pocket, and we have not received one cent from the administrator. We are doing exactly what we said we would do. We are protecting workers' statutory and community standard entitlements and then we are trying to recover as much money as we can from the administration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. He is a very strong advocate of not only regional Australia but industry in his electorate - and in South Australia, of course, including the car industry. While I am thanking people, can I also thank the now absent member for Batman for his compliment yesterday in the House calling me `Action Man'. My mother always says, `Bear closest to your heart the compliments of your critics,' and I bear that much closer than I do most compliments, although it does not quite have the resonance of `Chainsaw'!In all honesty, I am just part of the Howard government team that focuses on action and outcomes. Let me say for the record what the Howard government has delivered, apart from low interest rates, low inflation and solid productivity growth. Let me talk just about my area. In manufacturing, GDP growth is up 16 per cent, auto industry export growth is up threefold, there is record spending on science and innovation, and a $25 billion trade deal with China - the biggest trade deal to China ever. Invest Australia in my department has attracted 55 new investments to Australia in the last financial year. I will list just five: $2 billion extra in expenditure on a gas train at Burrup Peninsular - 2,000 jobs during the construction phase; $1 billion for Methanex on the Burrup Peninsular - 1,000 jobs during construction; $1.2 billion to Rio Tinto in their high smelt process - 500 jobs. Are you adding these up, Mr Speaker? - The fourth one was $1.5 billion to Comalco - 2,300 jobs during construction; and, finally, AMC - Australian Magnesium Corporation - 1,300 jobs during construction. That is a total $7 billion and 7,000 jobs. The opposition sit there and do nothing while this government makes the partnership with industry that creates Australian jobs and sees Australia grow.</DOC>

We did promise about a year ago to change the priority order of repayments in the event of insolvency. We intend to do this and we will keep our promise, but the important thing is to ensure that this change is done in a way which is most friendly to the creation of jobs and the continued expansion of business and the prosperity that it brings. That is what we have been doing these last few months: engaging in a very thorough process of consultation with the financial sector, with the business sector - particularly with the small business sector - and with insolvency practitioners to ensure that this important and necessary change will be made in the way that helps workers and does not damage the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I know she has a very keen interest in families and in what the coalition is doing for families, particularly as she has brought up three boys on her own. Of course, among the greatest things that the Liberal-National party government has done for families is provide low interest rates, which means far greater affordability of mortgages, and tax cuts, not to mention increased family assistance benefits, where $2 billion extra has gone to two million families.One of the greatest areas of improvement and increased funding is child care. The fact is that we have spent 70 per cent more in the last six years than Labor did in their last six years in office. Indeed, in the next four years we will spend around $8 billion compared to around $3.2 billion in Labor's last four years in office. The good news is that we have more children now using Commonwealth funded child care - there are now 720,000 children, an extra 190,000 places. The cost of child care is going down and we have 2,000 extra centres. Child care now is becoming far more affordable. Clearly, one area that is used quite often is outside school hours care. For members of the parliament, that is obviously referring to those young Australians who go to child care before school, after school and in school holidays. With the school holidays coming up, I am delighted to announce that the initial reallocation of 1,600 vacation care places will be in place before school holidays begin.In the member for Makin's electorate at the Golden Grove Primary School there will be a further 55 vacation care places allocated. Indeed, in the city of Ballarat, which I am sure the member for Ballarat would be interested in, there are 60 extra vacation care places. In the electorate of Page, adjoining my electorate, there are 15 extra vacation care places. In the city of Lismore -  - I hear the interjection from the member for Gellibrand. In her electorate, there are 30 extra vacation care places in the city of Maribyrnong. So there is no doubt that the coalition government has a very good record when it comes to outside school hours care. Why shouldn't we? - When we came to government in 1996 there were around 72,000 places in outside school hours care. That has risen now to around 230,000 places, a 221 per cent increase. Today, there are 80,000 vacation care places. Let us remember that when Labor was in government the whole sector of outside school hours care comprised only 72,000 places. So it is absolutely ridiculous for Labor, and the member for Gellibrand, to claim that we are spending less money when it comes to child care. I was surprised to read the following comments which the member for Gellibrand made about child care in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday: `I hope Senator Vanstone is putting the hard word on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.' I thought to myself, `This is most interesting language. It was not so long ago that the member for Gellibrand was claiming that a member of the parliament was doing the same to her.' I am all for equality, but this is absolute hypocrisy. She should not be taking her lessons from the member for Lilley when it comes to pulling tactics such as this fabrication. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The current advice available to the government is that, on the assessment of the Indonesian authorities, the death toll remains at approximately 180. At this stage, 20 Australians are confirmed killed. Two others, who have not been identified, died in Australian care, one during evacuation and one in hospital in Darwin. We expect that the Australian death toll will grow significantly. I do not think it appropriate to do other than speculate as to the figure, but it will grow significantly. As I indicated on Sunday evening, the nation must prepare itself for a much worse death toll than the publicly confirmed number of Australian fatalities. Officials are working as quickly as possible to identify those who have been killed. A further 22 disaster identification specialists from federal and state police forces will arrive in Bali today to assist. The government is confident that there are sufficient Australian specialists to identify those killed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working with families to clarify the status of 200 Australians whose whereabouts remain unknown. Stabilisation of the remains of those killed is a major priority. I can inform the House that five refrigeration units were flown by the RAAF into Bali this morning, and Defence is currently assessing whether it needs more refrigeration capacity. The identification of the remains will take place in Bali. The government, in this context, has engaged Kenyons, a firm of international disaster morticians, to prepare the remains for repatriation. Qantas will fly them back, in cooperation with the international firm.There are, on my advice, no Australians still in hospital in Bali. All have been evacuated, most of them to Darwin by the RAAF. Many have been transferred overnight to Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney. The most seriously ill remain in Darwin - there are 13 of them.As the House knows, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice and Customs, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the directors-general of ASIO and ASIS are in Bali today and will be travelling to Jakarta tonight. They will be holding discussions with their Indonesian counterparts on the investigation, with a view to cooperation to bring those responsible for this outrage to justice. There is mounting evidence of the involvement of al-Qaeda, together with Jemaah Islamiah, in the attack. We will be moving as a government to have Jemaah Islamiah listed as a terrorist organisation in the United Nations as soon as possible, and we have received indications from other countries, including at least one P5 member, that that move will be supported. This will give rise under certain trigger mechanisms in legislation for certain action to be taken.Can I say again how much the nation should be in debt to the emergency services that have been involved. This is distressing, awful, tragic work; but it has to be, and it is being, undertaken. I hope that what is being done is adequate. I believe it is. But, as always in a situation such as this, the government remains open to considering suggestions as to how additional things can or should be done. I record my thanks to the medical services, particularly to the staff of the Royal Darwin Hospital, which has been the main receiving point for people being brought from Bali. As always in these situations, the work of doctors and nurses is absolutely magnificent. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. Australians deserve answers to what happened in Bali, and the government is committed to doing everything it can to bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. As the Prime Minister has just mentioned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs are in Bali. They are accompanied by the Director-General of ASIO and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. As the Prime Minister said, they will travel to Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian government, and the subject of these discussions will of course include law enforcement. Cooperation in this respect between our two governments is essential in the pursuit of those responsible for this indiscriminate, unprovoked slaughter of human life. Our agreement with Indonesia on counter-terrorism provides a good framework for this to occur. In Australia, following notification of the bomb attacks in Bali, the AFP and ASIO established a joint strike team within the AFP's incident coordination centre. The Australian Customs Service is also represented on that team. The centre is coordinating all information and inquiries in relation to the incident. All AFP regional offices have also established major incident rooms.The initial team deployed to Bali consisted of 10 AFP members and two ASIO officers. This has been supplemented by two experienced AFP crime scene examiners. Two technical officers and a further ASIO member travelled to Bali from Singapore. There were also a further seven AFP personnel at the location; two were liaison officers and I understand the others were there on holiday. A further 22 AFP and state police members are due to depart for Bali today. They attempted to leave last night but unfortunately the New Zealand Air Force aircraft in which they were travelling suffered a cracked windscreen. An AFP media adviser is currently en route on a commercial flight. That will provide a significant team.Let me summarise what the team will comprise. There will be two AFP liaison officers, an AFP operational commander, 10 AFP investigators and four police technical officers. There will be a total of 11 disaster victim identification officers - two from the AFP, three from the Queensland police force and six from the Western Australian police force. There will be an AFP intelligence analyst, three ASIO intelligence officers and two AFP intelligence support officers. There will be an administration and coordination support officer, four crime scene examiners, two fingerprint examiners, two bomb examiners and two search and rescue experts, all from the AFP. As I mentioned, there will be a media adviser in addition. That makes a total of some 46 personnel in that team. There will be three ASIO officers working with the team.The AFP have advised that their incident control centre is operational. The AFP are taking interview statements from all Australian citizens returning from Bali. A specific survey form has been prepared for that purpose. We must and we will direct all available resources, including the might of the law, at protecting our community and ensuring that those responsible for threatening our security are brought to justice. We will do so as swiftly as possible. Further down the track, we will examine with the Indonesian authorities options for pursuing prosecution. At this stage, it is too early to say what those options might be; however, the public can rest assured that we will leave no stone unturned in working with Indonesia and other allies in the war against terrorism. The allies include the United Kingdom and the United States, who will be providing people on the ground in Bali. We intend to bring all those responsible to justice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Watson for his question. As with so many members of the House, he has been touched by this awful event. I understand that the first repatriation will probably take place today. The repatriation arrangements are being organised by Kenyons, in cooperation with Qantas. I can inform the House that the government will pay the entire cost of the repatriation back to Australia of the remains of all the people killed. We will also pay the costs of any Australians who need to go to Bali in order to assist with identification, although it is my understanding that the great bulk of the identification has occurred either in concert with people who are already there or on the basis of dental records or DNA and that the number of people required to leave Australia for identification purposes is not extensive. But if there are people who need to do so, we will be ready.The repatriation arrangements, so I am told, are best carried out by the company I mentioned, which has had experience in, amongst other things, major air disasters not only in the region but also around the world. It is an American company that is very experienced in this awful work. It will be operating with Qantas. Obviously, care has to be taken in relation to identification before repatriation takes place, lest the repatriation of the nationals of another country occurs. That is why the decision has been taken for the identifications to occur in Indonesia, in Bali, rather than in Australia, for reasons which I think will commend themselves to the House. That is why the arrangements I mentioned in response to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition regarding stabilisation and preservation of the remains are so very important. If there is anything further that the government can reasonably do to make it a little less burdensome for the people who are caught up in this event then we will certainly do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. We are obviously working around the clock to ensure people with relatives missing in Bali are informed of their whereabouts as soon as possible. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a help line early on the morning of Sunday, 13 October, to assist people seeking information about Australians in Bali. The number for that help line has been widely publicised; I think it has been carried in all the major Australian newspapers. By this morning, we had received 17,500 calls to that line. It is worth noting that this is a special number for inquiries about relatives in Bali only and that it will help if only one family member at a time contacts the hotline to gain information and then disseminates that amongst other family members. DFAT is also keeping its web site up to date on the broader issues and the latest developments in Bali.There were 113 seriously injured Australians hospitalised prior to evacuation. The Australian Consulate-General in Bali has been working tirelessly with medical staff and has arranged medical evacuations of those injured in the blasts. Three additional consular officers from Canberra have arrived in Bali, together with 14 staff members from the embassy in Jakarta, to assist with the consular effort. Following a search of Bali hospitals on Monday, we are now confident that there are no injured Australians remaining in the hospitals in Bali. Around 200 Australians remain unaccounted for at this stage. This should not be confused with the likely Australian death toll, which should become clearer within the next 24 hours. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff have worked through the night to reconcile cases reported to us by families with information available in Bali and from other sources. Resolving the number of Australians unaccounted for remains a key priority at this time, obviously. DFAT, Defence and the Australian Federal Police are working hard to establish a proper process for the difficult task of identifying, preserving and repatriating to Australia the remains of Australian victims. As the Prime Minister indicated, an additional 22 Australian disaster identification specialists from Australian police forces are either in Bali or on their way to Bali as we speak. Australians are advised to defer all travel to Bali until further notice and to defer all non-essential travel to other parts of Indonesia. Australians in all other parts of Indonesia should exercise a high level of caution, defer all non-essential travel within Indonesia and avoid public places where possible - particularly areas known to be frequented by expatriates such as clubs, restaurants, bars, places of worship, schools or outdoor recreation events. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will obviously, on a continuing basis, upgrade the travel advisory.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. I indicate to the House in response that the Australian government has been closely involved in the provision of emergency treatment and medical evacuation services for the people injured in this terrorist attack in Bali. The Department of Health and Ageing is working closely with Emergency Management Australia, with the Department of Defence, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and with territory and state governments and their health departments to ensure that critically injured Australians who have been airlifted to Darwin can be safely transferred to major hospitals. So far, as has been indicated in earlier answers, there has been an evacuation of the seriously injured from Bali, the provision of a quantity of medical supplies to Bali and the dispatch of four Medivac teams to Darwin to help those admitted as victims of burns, trauma, fractures and amputation.To relieve pressure on the staff and the resources of the Royal Darwin Hospital, transfers have been undertaken to other states and territories and are expected to be completed in the next two days. I should indicate to the House that many of the staff members of the Royal Darwin Hospital have been working virtually without rest for the last 48 hours. Aircraft have been operated by the Royal Australian Air Force, by state governments and by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Many patients - including 15 who are suffering from critical burn injuries - have been moved from Darwin to hospitals in Perth, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne, and there are other Australian hospitals on stand-by should they be required. I also mention the fact that there are Australians in Bali, including doctors and nurses there on vacation, who have lent their assistance to those who have been the victims of that terrible incident. These are examples - there, in Darwin and elsewhere around Australia - of people working together in very tragic times.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. The terrorist attacks on the United States last year marked a fundamental shift in the international security environment, and the recent events in Bali have brought that reality, in the most horrific possible way, directly to our doorstep. No longer can we sit back and assume that we are safe from such devastating events. The Prime Minister has announced reviews of our security arrangements and domestic security laws, and those reviews are under way. The Protective Security Coordination Centre in my department, as the primary agency responsible for coordinating and managing the Commonwealth's protective security and counter-terrorism arrangements, is on 24-hour activation. The PSCC's watch office plays a central role in the coordination of Commonwealth responses to threats or incidents of terrorism, and forms a vital part of the crisis management arrangements under the National Anti-Terrorist Plan. My department has coordinated a Special Incident Task Force - SITF, as they are known - and guarding and security arrangements are being increased as required. SITF is a committee made up of appropriate Commonwealth departments and agencies that are responsible for the coordination of the Commonwealth's response to a terrorist or national security incident within Australia. It is called by the PSCC coordinator in consultation with or at the request of relevant Commonwealth authorities, and it includes representatives from the Attorney-General's Department, ASIO, AFP, Defence, DFAT, Emergency Management Australia, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, PM&amp;C and other Commonwealth agencies as required. The Office of National Assessments, ONA, has also established a watch office which is operating on a 24-hour basis. Emergency Management Australia, at the request of DFAT, has been coordinating the movement of injured people from Darwin to other states, and casualties have been transported by a combination of civilian and Defence aircraft. Forty additional APS staff are providing additional static security in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, and 40 additional AFP close personal protection personnel have been deployed.Australia needs to be able to protect itself from the inexplicable and horrifying violence of terrorists. The government moved swiftly last year to strengthen our counter-terrorism arrangements. In the budget, the government committed an extra $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security. In my portfolio, an additional $426.6 million was earmarked specifically to bolster our counter-terrorism abilities. Following the high-level review of Australia's security and counter-terrorism arrangements instigated by the government, the government has introduced a series of measures designed to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism legislative framework. As I said, in the wake of the events in Bali, the government has announced a review of both our domestic terrorist legislation and our counter-terrorism capacity. While both were recently reviewed, the terrorist attack in Bali makes another such review a matter of responsibility to all Australians. As the Prime Minister indicated, it could be necessary to further strengthen our domestic security laws in the light of the Bali terrorist incident, but until that review is complete it is not appropriate to speculate on outcomes.We are doing everything we can to ensure we catch and prosecute those responsible under our tough anti-terrorism laws. In developing our new laws, the government has consistently argued that we need strong laws to both deter and prevent terrorism as well as to punish those who plan or carry out terrorist acts. It would be irresponsible of the government not to do everything within its power to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. We must make sure that we are in the best possible position to identify, stop and punish those responsible for terrorist acts and those planning terrorist acts, and the government is committed to doing just that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Australia has world practice nationwide counter-terrorism arrangements in place to respond to any security related incident. The national counter-terrorism plan clearly sets out arrangements for how Australia responds to terrorism. These are in line with our federal system of government. The Commonwealth acts in cooperation with the states and territories through longstanding arrangements between security, defence, law enforcement, intelligence and emergency services. Under the plan, the federal government and the states have agreed that the states and their police forces retain responsibility for protecting themselves from terrorist attack but, where it is required and where it is appropriate, the federal government will make available a wide range of assistance to the states. These measures were reviewed and strengthened following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Australia's determination to win the war against terrorism has galvanised our state and federal leaders into united action. In April this year, the Prime Minister convened a leaders summit to consider the challenges of the new security environment and to ensure the right arrangements were in place to deal with a terrorist attack. The leaders summit was a landmark event and marked a new beginning in cooperation between governments in the fight against terrorism. For the first time, state and territory leaders publicly recognised that certain types of terrorist incidents needed to be strategically managed at the national level. Leaders reached agreement on a clear mechanism in which the government takes charge of the strategic coordination of Commonwealth, state and territory resources in a national terrorist situation. They also reached agreement on a number of other antiterrorist related measures. Leaders agreed to a reference of power to the Commonwealth in relation to terrorism. Legislation to implement this agreement is well progressed at both the state and federal levels and is on target for early enactment. Leaders agreed to take any action necessary to ensure that terrorists can be prosecuted under criminal law. The leaders also agreed to reconstitute the Standing Advisory Committee for Commonwealth/State Co-operation for Protection Against Violence - the so-called SAC-PAV - as the national counter-terrorism committee, with a broader mandate to cover prevention and consequence management issues. Leaders also agreed to work towards better processes for gathering and sharing intelligence and to improve the effectiveness of our efforts to combat organised crime by transforming the National Crime Authority into a new body known as the Australian Crime Commission.Following the summit, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments are developing an intergovernmental agreement in relation to Australia's counter-terrorism arrangements. This will include an annual report to the Council of Australian Governments on national counter-terrorism preparedness, including emergency response and recovery measures. The leaders summit was an important milestone in the history of Australia's national security. The outcomes were groundbreaking and they reflect a commitment at all levels of government to work together to ensure that we have an appropriate framework in place to deal with any terrorist threat. Following the Bali terrorist attacks, it is vitally important that we continue to implement the outcomes of the leaders summit as swiftly as possible. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The airlines, particularly Qantas, have responded quickly to the circumstances in Bali. I can inform the House that Qantas has scheduled additional flights from Bali to return as many Australians as quickly as possible. It has sent two of its own doctors and three nurses to Denpasar. It has transported 16 medical specialists from Emergency Management Australia to provide medical attention to passengers in need. Qantas has also waived all conditions on tickets to Australia from Bali. That means that, if you get a flight to Sydney but have a ticket to Perth, you can use that same ticket to complete your trip. Qantas has also advised us that it is also carrying all airline customers from other carriers with tickets from Denpasar to Australia at no additional cost; that for those without a valid ticket a reduced price ticket is available; that a special compassionate return ticket is available for families; and that Qantas will return the deceased to Australia at no charge to families.As a result of the travel warning issued in relation to Bali and Indonesia, in many circumstances Australians will receive refunds for holidays cancelled or postponed. Qantas and Singapore Airlines are offering full refunds for air fares and package deals, with no penalties. Customers can transfer to other flights at a later date at no additional cost until the end of October. Garuda Airlines are making a similar offer until 27 October. Many travellers who have booked their travel through licensed operators should be able to cancel for some refund for the month of October, defer their travel or transfer their booking to alternative destinations. People with any concerns about cancelling their travel should contact their travel agent. I should also advise the House that Air Paradise International, a new Bali based airline that was to have begun operation next month, has suspended all services until further notice. There will be full refunds on all tickets.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I certainly recognise the concerns of the sugar industry, particularly the cane growers in his electorate and in the electorates of other members from North Queensland.  In considering its decision with regard to the production subsidy, obviously the government analysed the WTO legality of the subsidy and of so-called green rebates. I can inform the member that green rebates are not WTO compliant, whereas the production subsidy is, as is the excise that has been applied and the balancing production subsidy. With regard to standards, the member for Kennedy would be aware that the government is currently conducting a review of fuel standards with regard to biofuels. I understand that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage will receive that report later in the year. As far as the capacity of imports is concerned - I think that was the other part of the question - obviously this country imports and exports oil of different standards. From memory, the level of imports of oil from Indonesia is probably in excess of $1 billion, as is the case for oil from the Middle East. We will look at maintaining a stable flow as far as that energy source is concerned to maintain stability in the Australian economy. Certainly we are concerned about the status of the sugar industry. We want to ensure its sustainability. The ethanol industry as proposed is not going to be a silver bullet. It is part of the answer. It is an issue that the government continues to work through.</DOC>

As the Prime Minister mentioned, travel arrangements to Bali, particularly for those who need to go for identification purposes, have been put in place by the government. As far as Centrelink's role is concerned, Centrelink is a bit unsure of the full scale of this disaster. Indeed, it will be some time before the government or Centrelink can assess the impact and make any consideration. In the past, Centrelink has always stood ready in periods of crisis and I am sure there will be no exception in this case. </DOC>

 - The government is willing to consider that proposal. I do not dismiss it out of hand, but I do not automatically embrace it. I will consider it. When something on the scale of what has occurred happens, you have to be ready to look at a number of responses, but you have to do so in a measured, considered way. We will seriously consider what the opposition has put forward. If we think there is merit in it, we will go down that path.Of course, we recognise, as I am sure the Leader of the Opposition recognises, that building an alliance against terrorism is something that has to occur both locally and internationally. Terrorism knows no particular geographical, provincial or regional restraint. There is little doubt in my mind that, in one form or another, al-Qaeda is either a major player or an inspiration for terrorist behaviour that is taking place in different parts of the world - as distant as Chechnya and Indonesia. In those circumstances, what is very much needed is a world alliance against terrorism as well as a consideration of regional gatherings. We will give it serious consideration, but along with a number of other things that we need to consider.</DOC>

 - I cannot give the member exact numbers of foreign nationals except to say this: there are significant numbers of people from a variety of countries as well as a significant number of Balinese people and other nationals of Indonesia. It is clear that those countries whose citizens have died include the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland and Singapore. I am afraid I am not in a position to say more at this stage, for reasons I hope the House will understand - not through indifference to the suffering of others but because, as Prime Minister of Australia, my priority, my preoccupation, has been to establish Australian fatalities and Australian injuries. I do recognise that the atrocity has gone beyond what has affected Australia and Australians. In Bali today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced some emergency assistance to Indonesia's health services, which remain under very heavy pressure. We will provide a cash grant of $200,000 to the Indonesian Red Cross to assist in the replenishment of emergency supplies and to support its work in Bali. In addition, Australia is urgently procuring medical consumables from Australia, including bandages and medicines, for immediate dispatch to Bali, at an estimated cost of $100,000.The Australian Defence Force has provided urgently needed medical teams and air evacuation of the injured from Bali to Darwin. I might indicate that some of the people medically evacuated were nationals of other countries. This morning, amongst the many calls I have received from world leaders, I received a call from Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada. As well as conveying the sympathy of the Canadian government and the Canadian people, he thanked me for the way in which we had assisted Canadian nationals who had been caught up. We have, of course, a longstanding reciprocal consular arrangement with a number of countries, and Canada is one of those that we have a very close consular relationship with. If there are other ways in which we can help the local Indonesian people of Bali we will. I do think that one of the things this country could do when - how shall I put it? - the immediate emergency has been responded to is to consider a more substantial recognition of the shared suffering and grief and also to mark in some way the warmth that Australians who have been to Bali in happier times feel towards the people of that island. It is quite a deep bond, and we will never feel the same about it again, unfortunately. But it is not the fault of the Balinese people; it is the fault of others. I think, as well as the things that have already been announced, something additional would be entirely appropriate.</DOC>

Certainly I am aware that there is currently a conference in Melbourne of heads of the various workers compensation jurisdictions and, at the instigation of the Commonwealth government, that has gone onto the agenda of the workers compensation systems.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The latest advice to the government is that 30 Australians are confirmed dead. I regret to inform the House that one of those evacuated to Perth died in hospital yesterday. There is every expectation that the Australian death toll will rise considerably as the authorities work through and further identification takes place in relation to the missing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been working urgently with families to narrow down the number of people missing, and at present there are 140 cases unresolved. The countries from which other victims have come include Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France, the United States, Sweden, New Zealand, Germany, Ecuador, South Korea and Switzerland. I cannot at this stage establish firm numbers from those different countries.It is of course now, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated, the highest priority to identify and repatriate the remains, and I want to provide the House with some information on that. This is not easy and is, I know, very distressing to the families of those concerned. Let me say at the outset that I do fully appreciate, understand and sympathise with the sense of frustration and grief and all the other emotions being suffered by the families, which you can only begin to contemplate if you are not actually involved. The condition of the bodies means that identification is extremely difficult. The Indonesian authorities - for reasons I have to say I understand - are insisting, except in cases where obvious identification is possible, on the application of the international or Interpol protocol regarding the investigation of remains, particularly in cases where there have been multiple fatalities. That international protocol means identification occurs according to one of three methods - dental records, fingerprints or DNA.Sadly, many of these victims are young Australians. As such, their teeth were in good condition, and accessing dental records is not easy. In many cases also, because of the badly charred character of the bodies, fingerprints are not available. I have been told by somebody who I will come to in a moment that, as a consequence, in at least 50 per cent of the cases the only way of properly identifying people is through DNA analysis and sequencing. This was the advice I had from the relevant departments. This morning I spoke for some half an hour on the telephone to Professor Chris Griffiths, who is in Bali. He is the head of the ID unit of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Westmead Hospital. He is also an Australian delegate to Interpol. He is an expert in dental forensic identification and he, along with other professors of forensic medicine, is coordinating the task of identifying the remains. He confirmed from his on-the-spot experience what I had previously been told. I do know the gentleman concerned; he is a constituent of mine, and I have dealt with him in the past. He is a professor and is an expert in this field. He said that he fully understood the problem. He understood how, in some cases, a relative will say, `I can identify my wife or my husband from a piece of jewellery.' He reminded me of the fact that the appearance of remains alters often very dramatically after death, and his very strong professional view as expressed to me was that, if the Interpol protocol was not followed, there was a one in five possibility of an identity error. He said this process was followed very closely in cases where multiple deaths have occurred in the one incident and where, as a consequence, the possibility of a mistake is that much greater. I know that in the eyes of some - and I understand that and I recognise it - this will be perhaps taking a distressingly strong or formal position in a difficult situation. But I do not think, in the circumstances, the Indonesian authorities can be criticised, and in the end we have to work with the government of another country where this horrific event has occurred.Could I also inform the House by way of comparison that - and this information I have obtained from the Australian Federal Police - in the case of the Childers backpackers disaster in Queensland, there were 16 victims. They were almost exclusively the victims of burns. It took two weeks to complete the identification process, and that process was carried out in Australia under a very controlled crime scene regime.I am sorry; this is very difficult for the families. I feel for them and I have had some representations - and I am sure many members have - about this and I sympathise with them. That is why I have not only got the advice of departments - and I did not seriously doubt that advice, but it is always good to have a separate professional on-the-spot assessment - but have also spoken to Professor Griffiths. Having spoken to Professor Griffiths, I have to say that as of now - and, if some other argument is put forward, I will listen to that - I can do none other than support, difficult though it is, the stance being taken.If DNA identification is to take place, there will need to be samples obtained. The taking of the DNA samples, in turn, will not be easy because a lot of the muscle tissue will have disappeared and the process will involve, in some cases, extracting marrow from bones. That will need to be sent to Australia. It will take time and it will be very difficult.I have to explain this in detail to the parliament to underline two things: that I do understand how people feel; but that we are faced with a situation where a formal and careful identification has to take place. As I say, because of the nature of the injuries, fingerprinting is not possible in many cases; it is in some. And because, sadly, many of the victims are young Australians and young Australians these days have much better teeth than their parents, there is not such an availability of dental records. So we are left with that situation.I appeal to all of those who are focusing on this to please understand the difficulty faced by the Indonesian authorities. In the end they control the situation, it is their country, and I have to say that they are following an established practice in applying the Interpol protocol. That is the advice I have received. If I receive any contrary advice or if there is any further or better view that can responsibly short-circuit the process, I will be only too happy to ensure that that is embraced.The process is under way, but it will take a considerable amount of time. There are 24 police specialists in Bali working on this now. State police will soon start collecting identification information and material from family members in Australia - photographs, clothing, dental records where they exist, and hair samples - but we need a confirmed missing list, and we are working urgently on that. The staff of Kenyons, the international disaster morticians, will arrive in Bali today and, where possible, they will start preparing bodies for eventual repatriation.I said yesterday that we had hoped to repatriate the first body yesterday, but this was not possible because of the identification procedures - and I might indicate that I have been informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the family of the person concerned indicated, after the situation was explained, that it was better for the proper identification process to proceed. I do appreciate that state government agencies are keenly seeking information and will have an important interest and role in the repatriation process, and we are staying very closely in touch with them. Mr Downer, the foreign minister, Senator Ellison, the AFP Commissioner and the directors-general of ASIO and ASIS are in Jakarta for talks with their Indonesian counterparts. Can I say in relation to that that the foreign minister and I will be having a lengthy discussion this afternoon after question time. Because of some of the time differences, he will be in a position then to inform me of the outcome. I know the Attorney-General will be saying something a little later in question time regarding the investigation that is going on there. I think the House will be aware of some of the reports regarding the work of the Indonesians. I can only stress again that we need to work closely with Indonesia. It does not really serve our purposes, given that this crime occurred in another country, to be speculating publicly or in advance about the nature or quality of the Indonesian response.I indicated yesterday some of the preliminary financial assistance given to the authorities in Bali. It included medical consumables - bandages and medicines for burns victims - and a cash grant to help replenish medical supplies. I might also mention that, in the first 48 hours, we also flew in two pallets of Defence medical stores, 300 kilograms of medical supplies from a civilian company and aeromedical evacuation supplies. This included IV fluids, analgesic medicines, bandages and blood. The government continues to work with Australian medical organisations to meet the demands of the hospitals in Bali.I might say that always in the memory of those who have been touched by this tragedy will be the response of an overloaded inadequate medical system in Bali. It is very much in my mind and the mind of the government that something significant and more permanent should be done not only as a memorial to the people who have died but also as a gesture of gratitude from the Australian government for the way in which, despite the enormous shortcomings of the medical system in Bali - through no fault of their own - the Indonesians tried in a wonderful way to respond on Saturday night and Sunday. I will be having something more to say about that later on - not now, but later on. I think something more significant and tangible should be done, and it will be done, to recognise our debt as a nation and also as individuals touched by this for what they have done.Can I also mention to the House that, since last question time, I have had a number of other calls. I had a very thoughtful call from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and also from the President of South Africa. In addition to the message of sympathy from Her Majesty The Queen, I have received a message from His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales saying, `I have been deeply shocked by the reports of the terrorist outrage in Bali in which so many young Australians have been killed.' He joins his two sons in expressing their grief and their anguish.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie. As I told the House on Monday, the intelligence available to the government highlighted the general threat environment but at no time was specific about Saturday night's attack in Bali. Today the official spokesman for the American Department of State has confirmed that the United States had no specific information of a planned bombing in Bali. As the House will know, many general warnings of possible terrorist attacks in Indonesia have been made. For instance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advice regarding Indonesia has, for some time, warned inter alia in the following terms: Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted.I have been informed by the relevant intelligence agencies that the only possibly relevant reference to Bali in recent intelligence reporting was its inclusion, along with a number of other tourist and cultural locations across Indonesia, for possible terrorist activity against United States tourists. This intelligence was assessed by agencies and the view was formed by them that no alteration in the threat assessment level - then at a high - applying to Indonesia was warranted.The Director-General of the Office of National Assessments, Mr Kim Jones, has specifically informed me that the intelligence agencies have searched their records to establish whether there was any information that warned of the bomb attack in Bali on 12 October. He has said that although there was a body of information from numerous sources that pointed to a terrorist presence and threat throughout Indonesia, no material that specifically warned of the attack in Bali was identified. Nevertheless, and given the magnitude of what has occurred, I will ask the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to assess all of the relevant intelligence material and report to me on his findings. This request to the inspector-general does not connote any want of confidence by me in the work of our intelligence agencies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I advise her and the House that around 80 officers in total of Australian government agencies have now arrived in Bali to assist with a range of activities, some of which have been outlined in considerable detail by the Prime Minister. There is also a provision there to provide counselling and any further assistance which the authorities in Bali may require in this regard. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, may I add in relation to a question concerning counselling in Australia which the honourable member for Lingiari asked me about yesterday, that I am advised that state and territory health authorities have also put in place comprehensive mental health and counselling programs and there is a range of organisations providing these services. Those 1800 numbers will be made available through a variety of ways, including the web site of the Department of Health and Ageing, for those who wish to make use of it. I am sure that all honourable members are aware of the services provided through Lifeline, for example, and similar organisations which are funded in part by the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth has also made it known to the states and territories that, if there is any further assistance required beyond what they say they are coping with at the present time, they should come back to us in that regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. There are many Australians who have been looking for ways in which they can show tangible support for the victims of the Bali bombing and their families. They have been looking for a vehicle by which they can practically help those who are in need. Today the Australian Red Cross is launching an Australia-wide appeal to help the victims and their families. As a humanitarian relief organisation, Red Cross is already providing support to victims in a number of ways - with blood and blood products, registration of evacuees, coordination of accommodation and personal support. Through the Bali appeal, the Australian Red Cross will help alleviate the loss suffered by victims who have been injured, who have lost close family members or who will suffer sustained physical and emotional trauma. It is important that the funds raised are directed to where there is the greatest need and where other sources of funds and support are lacking. The Red Cross will liaise with government agencies to determine the areas of greatest need. Donations can be made in either of two categories: to assist Australian victims and their families or to assist the Red Cross to continue their work in providing relief and addressing medical supplies in the affected areas in Bali. The Red Cross advise that they will spend 90 per cent of donations on providing direct assistance to the victims and that residual funds will be used to recover administrative costs, in accordance with the Australian Council for Overseas Aid code of conduct and Australian Taxation Office rules. Under Australian tax law, the Australian Red Cross Society is considered to be a deductible gift recipient, which means that gifts or donations of $2 or more to the Red Cross are deductible for income tax purposes. The Commonwealth will be making a contribution of $1 million to the appeal. Donations can be made online at the Australian Red Cross web site, by mail, by telephone or at any branch of the National Australia Bank.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for her question and her obvious concern in relation to this matter. I am aware of the demand for skin and burns treatment products for victims of the Bali bombings. The Department of Health and Ageing has been liaising with the state and territory chief health officers to continually assess the demand for skin and burns treatment products for the victims of the bombings.The most important product in this regard is TransCyte, which is marketed in Australia by the company Smith and Nephew. This is used as a temporary cover to reduce fluid loss and to prevent infection for a sufficient time for the patient to be grafted with their own skin. A further shipment of TransCyte was in fact brought into Australia just last night to deal with this situation. The advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration prior to question time today was that they believe that there is sufficient product now available in Australia. However, they are continuing to assess the capacity to bring in further supplies to meet additional need if that arises - for example, if patients of other nationalities were brought into Australia. I assure the honourable member and the House that these matters are being looked at carefully and that I am advised there is no cause for concern at the present time; but we will continue to monitor this and to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of the product available.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. At this very moment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs are engaged in discussions in Indonesia on a range of subjects, including of course the investigation of what occurred. We have reason to believe that those discussions are proceeding positively and we look forward to the ministers' full report in due course. As I mentioned yesterday, the criminal investigation into the bomb blasts in Bali has begun and is continuing as a matter of the most urgent priority. The AFP and ASIO are continuing to work closely with Indonesian authorities in assisting them with the criminal investigation. There are currently 48 AFP, ASIO and state and territory police officers in Bali assisting the Indonesian National Police with the many aspects of the investigation. In addition, I am advised that there are personnel from at least four other countries in Bali assisting the investigation team. I am advised that the make-up of the team is constantly changing, as the operational needs dictate the skill sets required at various stages of the investigation. As I informed the House yesterday, this group currently includes forensic specialists, crime scene investigation officers, specialist victim identification officers, post bomb blast investigators, intelligence officers and general investigators and support staff.I note that there have been media reports claiming that a particular sort of explosive was used in the blasts. My advice is that no official report has been made on this and that analysis is still being conducted. As the House can appreciate, it would not be appropriate in any event to be discussing particulars relating to evidentiary matters. There have been other reports suggesting that the Indonesian National Police are to interview Abu Bakar Bashir among others. Again, it would not be appropriate to speculate on who may or may not be interviewed by the INP. This is an operational matter within their jurisdiction. It is expected that a large number of people will be interviewed by the authorities in the course of the investigation.Teams of federal agents have been speaking to passengers as they arrive at Australian airports from Bali to debrief them and to identify potential witnesses to the incidents. State and territory police have also been assisting with this task. It is expected that the total number of people returning from Bali and having contact with the police will be in the thousands. Already approximately 5,800 questionnaires distributed to returning passengers have been received. The vast amount of information obtained through this process is being collated in conjunction with many other sources of information. The number of inquiries resulting from the process will be extensive and will take time and resources to pursue. The AFP is coordinating those inquiries and pursuing all possible leads.This is a massive task and, on behalf the government, I express my heartfelt thanks to the AFP officers. I also thank the public and those returning from Bali in such traumatic circumstances for their cooperation and the assistance they are providing to the authorities. I would also like to acknowledge the huge public response to requests for information made through the media, the immediate and continuing response from the medical sector as well as the collaborative response from Australia's law enforcement agencies - Commonwealth, state and territory.The AFP is continuing to seek from visitors to Bali any videos or photographs taken in Bali which could potentially contain evidence beneficial to the investigation. If any member of the public discovers he or she has relevant material, they can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 to pass these on to the AFP. The AFP's international network is also working closely with host country authorities to obtain information from travellers that may assist with the investigation. In addition to the on-the-ground investigations, a forensic major incident coordination centre is being established in Canberra to provide forensic support to the investigation.While it remains too early to say who may have been ultimately responsible for the bomb blasts, the team in Bali backed up by AFP resources in Australia, the AFP's overseas liaison officer network along with state and territory police will be working around the clock to bring the perpetrators to justice.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for his question and follow up on that question and, indeed, the question yesterday, by outlining what Centrelink is doing for victims of the Bali bombing and the families and relatives that are associated with them.The first point is that Centrelink will be streamlining access to payments for victims of the Bali disaster, particularly eligibility for mainstream payments. Our first priority, of course, is to those who are injured and who may be eligible for sickness allowance. Likewise, the next priority is to partners and dependants of people injured, deceased or missing and, again, looking at how we can speed up the eligibility for parenting payment, family tax benefit or even Newstart. Clearly, the priority as well is to see how we can speed up payments, whether they are bereavement payments and bereavement allowance, for the partners of those who are confirmed dead. Likewise, we will be looking at the eligibility criteria for people who are caring for dependants of people who are injured, deceased or missing.We intend to process those claims as quickly as possible. People can contact Centrelink - those forms can be partially filled out - and we can try to get a payment to them as quickly as possible. Likewise, we can expedite payments to be made automatically through electronic transfer. Where people may not be eligible for a Centrelink payment, an avenue exists through a special benefit payment, which in the short-term might alleviate some of the concerns that you have just raised. Indeed, that can be facilitated very quickly and the circumstances of that can be resolved later on. These are the measures that Centrelink is putting in place at the moment - along with a number of counselling services - to assist victims, families and dependants. Regarding the insurance and travel insurance area, of course the government is open to looking at those specific requests.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is continuing to provide extensive consular assistance to Australian victims of this atrocity and their families. The Prime Minister announced yesterday that the government would pay the entire cost of repatriation back to Australia of the remains of people killed and for any Australians needing to go to Bali to assist with identification. Information available indicates that about 40 family representatives have gone to Bali to assist in that process. I can also inform the House that the government will pay air fares and accommodation costs to enable family members to be reunited with their loved ones injured in Bali and recovering in hospitals in Australia.To date the crisis centre here in Canberra - the helpline - has received about 19,200 calls, providing advice and guidance to concerned Australian citizens. I informed the House yesterday that about 200 Australians were unaccounted for at that stage. Since then, we have been able to account for 60 of those 200, so that the figure now stands at 140 unaccounted for. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff continue to work to reconcile all cases reported to us by families with information available in Bali and from other sources. Resolving the number of unaccounted for Australians remains a key priority. We have completed the process of recontacting families in Australia who have family members currently unaccounted for. Mr Speaker, I ask families that have received information that their relatives are safe and well to please contact the DFAT helpline on 1800 002 214. It will help us enormously in the process of working through those numbers of people who are still unaccounted for. To repeat, if families have information that their relatives are safe and well, please contact the helpline to assist in resolving those unresolved cases. It should also be noted that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is keeping its travel advisory for Indonesia under constant review. Australians are currently being advised to defer all travel to Bali until further notice and to defer all non-essential travel to Indonesia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I can inform the House of a number of developments in relation to insurance. Where individuals have taken out travel insurance, they should look at the contract and discuss with their insurer the extent of the coverage provided. For example, some credit card companies that provide travel insurance may have existing arrangements in place that provide full coverage for acts of terrorism. However, some newer travel insurance policies may have specifically excluded acts of terrorism. Following discussions between the Insurance Council of Australia and the government, the ICA has advised us that all major travel insurers have indicated that they will be covering the costs of medical and repatriation expenses of the victims of the Bali terrorist attack - that is, notwithstanding the specific exclusion of terrorism in the policy. The insurers have also indicated that they will provide coverage for the personal effects of those directly involved.However, for many affected individuals, travel insurance does not cover the cost of travel cancellations. Accordingly, we have spoken with the Australian Federation of Travel, who have indicated that various travel wholesalers, travel agents and airlines are providing refunds for travel and accommodation already booked but not yet taken. Qantas, Garuda and Singapore Airlines have said passengers will not pay a penalty for amending, deferring or cancelling travel to Bali for the month of October in the course of the travel warning, which the minister referred to a little earlier. In addition, Qantas, Venture Holidays and Viva Holidays have all announced that they will not impose penalties on customers due to travel to Bali before late October who decide to cancel or defer their holidays. In addition, Creative Holidays, Bali Bound Holidays, travel.com.au, Asian Explore Holidays, Bali Tours and Intrepid Travel have also all abolished cancellation penalties. We advise travellers to contact their travel agent to confirm the special arrangements they are making for cancellations.I can further advise the House that this morning private health insurers in Australia have announced that they will provide health insurance coverage to their members as if the terrorist attack in Bali had occurred within Australia. In addition, if travel insurance, travel industry refunds and the actions today of the private health insurers do not provide an appropriate safety net, the government is currently working on guidelines to ensure that Australians injured by the attack in Bali are not left out of pocket because of medical or evacuation expenses that are not covered by insurance. Such a scheme will also relate to meeting the uninsured costs of repatriating those Australians who lost their lives. There will be many who did not take out travel insurance. That may particularly be the case with some of the younger travellers. The government's scheme will ensure that those injured people without insurance will not be out of pocket because of their medical or evacuation expenses. We are grateful for the response from the travel related companies and the insurance industry, and we will continue to monitor and address events as they unfold.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. Since the beginning of this crisis the Commonwealth's Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr John McEwen, has been in regular contact with state and territory health departments, which has been a reason why we have been able to deliver - I believe - a successful nationally coordinated response through the emergency health system to this crisis. As indicated earlier to the House in other answers, evacuation of all known critically injured people has been completed and all departures from Bali are now by commercial means. The RAAF C130 aircraft have been running shuttle services to transfer patients from Darwin to other Australian centres, this being coordinated through Defence in conjunction with the Department of Health and Ageing and Emergency Management Australia. The four medivac teams have also been sent to Darwin and so far some 49 seriously injured patients have been transported to major hospitals in other states - for the information of the House: six to Adelaide, 11 to Brisbane, eight to Melbourne, 12 to Perth and 12 to Sydney. Seven injured people remain in Darwin Hospital and 12 injured foreign nationals have been evacuated to Australia, including at least five who are seriously injured.I also indicate to the House that the Private Hospitals Association in conjunction with Catholic Health Australia and Mayne Health Australia have also indicated their readiness to assist victims from Australia, Indonesia or elsewhere. In fact, the Darwin Private Hospital has already taken patients from the Royal Darwin Hospital, and we are grateful for this additional assistance. I have provided the House with some information in relation to other questions about burns and skin grafts and also counselling services. Adding to what I said to the member for Sydney earlier in relation to counselling, counselling services are being provided to relatives of victims by four Australian Defence Force chaplains, two psychologists and one trauma counsellor at the registration centre in the consulate in Bali and also at the morgue. These services will be supplemented as necessary in future days. The consulate in Bali is also in the process of establishing support services to assist Australian and other volunteers who have come to the assistance of victims following the explosion. The Australian government has also offered to fly Indonesian and Balinese victims to Australia for care if required and the Jakarta Embassy is closely monitoring this situation.The Prime Minister referred earlier to the provision of $200,000 in cash to the Indonesian Red Cross and also $100,000 in relation to medical consumables. I am also aware that Australian doctors are travelling to Bali to provide care for Balinese victims and that Senator Patterson has asked senior officers to consult with their state and territory counterparts to ensure these initiatives are effectively coordinated so that we can deliver the greatest benefit through these voluntary efforts. In conjunction with the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Department of Health and Ageing and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have put in place arrangements to waive the normal requirement for a death certificate to accompany a body being brought into Australia, an action that hopefully in some way will help some of the grieving families.I finally report that Senator Patterson has personally spoken to state and territory health ministers to thank them and the officials and officers of their various departments for their efforts - our doctors, nurses and all those others in the health system who have responded so magnificently to this very difficult and tragic situation.</DOC>

I can also inform the House that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission is meeting today and it will be considering some workplace relations ramifications of the Bali tragedy at the Commonwealth's instigation. I can also inform the House that today the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australia's peak employer body, has issued the following statement:Flexibility in working arrangements, appropriate leave and counselling have been provided in the past, and will again be important in affected workplaces.These types of matters are usually best handled by the good sense and judgment of Australian citizens. I would like to congratulate the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for its prompt and speedy advice and guidance to Australian employers. I should point out that on Friday I will be addressing the national council of Australian business.

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. The government has been in contact with a number of the major telecommunications carriers and they have reacted compassionately to the plight of victims of the tragedy and their families in an effort to relieve financial cost or burden, both in regard to the immediate events surrounding the attack in Bali as well as the hospitalisation of the injured and maimed.Optus will waive all charges for fixed line calls from Australia to Bali for a week-long period starting midnight Saturday, October 12; will waive all international charges for calls from an Optus mobile to any number in Bali during this period; will waive charges for calls from an Optus mobile where the Optus customer was in Bali during this period; and will waive bills to customers who died in the tragedy. Optus has provided a number of mobile handsets and prepaid calling cards to the Darwin Hospital for use by victims and their families. Optus will work with government to put further such arrangements in place to provide assistance in relation to telephone calls between hospitalised victims of the tragedy and their immediate family.Telstra, for all Australian immediate families who have been affected by loss of life or injury, will waive for a period of one month from the date of the disaster - after which the situation will be reviewed on the basis of continued hospitalisation - all fixed and mobile telecommunications costs, including calling, fax and Internet charges incurred for local, national and international communications in connection with the disaster. This would include, for example, international fixed and mobile calls to Bali from any Australian location and between various Australian staging locations. Telstra will also waive outstanding personal phone bills of the deceased victims. For all those Australian non-government not-for-profit organisations which are assisting victims and their immediate families who have been affected by loss of life or injury arising out of the disaster, Telstra will waive, for a period of one month from the date of the disaster, all fixed and mobile telecommunications costs, including calling, fax and Internet charges incurred for local, national and international communications. I should add that Telstra has today donated $100,000 to the Australian Red Cross Bali appeal.Vodafone will waive any outstanding personal phone bills of deceased victims and also will waive those additional phone costs incurred by the injured or their immediate families for calls between each other while the injured are hospitalised in Australia. Finally, Vodafone will waive the costs of any international call charges incurred by victims and their families for calls between Australia and Bali from the time of the bombing to the time the victim returned to Australia.These finer details will be announced by each of these carriers in a short while, including a contact number that customers affected can call and seek further information and assistance. The government - and indeed the parliament - welcomes these initiatives by the carriers involved. I am sure other carriers whom we have yet to contact will join in providing support to the victims of the terrorist attack and their families.</DOC>

 - Earlier this year, the Australian Labor Party claimed that there had been a $5 billion loss, which was false, as I made clear in the statements. Subsequently, on 4 March I released an extensive statement and did a full press conference, where I set out the material details in relation to the management of the Commonwealth's debt portfolio. Management of the Commonwealth's debt portfolio began using currency swaps in 1988, which amount to the same thing as borrowing in a foreign currency. They were entered into by the Labor Party in 1988 so that the Treasurer of the day could claim that he was not borrowing in foreign currencies but that he was borrowing in Australian currency and swapping it for foreign currency.From 1988, an $80 billion build-up in debt met with a 15 per cent benchmark - a huge build-up in foreign currency exposure. It was not until 1997, with the beginning of the repayment of Labor debt, that the currency exposure was reduced. This government is determined to repay Labor's debt, including the foreign currency exposure. As a consequence - as I indicated in my statement on 4 March and in debates subsequently - the Commonwealth will manage that down to zero over the period of maturities, with some maturities not due to expire until 2008. In relation to individual transactions, they vary according to the maturity date and the currency at a particular time. Since some of them are not going to mature until 2008, it is impossible to give an overall outcome of the program.For accrual purposes, we value the stock as at 30 June each year. It had a write-down as at 30 June 2001 of approximately $1.9 billion, and a write-up in the last financial year of $1.2 billion. Whilst the Labor Party showed a great deal of interest in the write-down at 30 June 2001, the Labor Party apparently shows no interest in the write-up on 30 June 2002. If it were being consistent, it would have been referring to it in the material which it was referring to today and the material which it was passing to the Bulletin.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Sunday has been declared a day of national mourning for those Australians and others who have died in the horrific terrorist attack in Bali. Australians will celebrate this in their own chosen ways. But the government has asked that Australia observe a minute's silence at 12 noon, Australian Eastern Standard Time. I am sure that television and radio services will mark the moment in an appropriate way. Also, as a simple unifying tribute, I encourage the wearing of a piece of wattle during the day and, where possible, the planting of wattle seeds as a personal gesture of remembrance and reflection. Church leaders of all denominations and religious leaders of all faiths have indicated that they will be conducting services as part of the national day of mourning. The Prime Minister will be attending morning service at St Paul's Church in Manuka. I am sure that many sporting clubs, including many football clubs, will also choose to spend the day of mourning together to remember people from their own teams or to remember people from their own competitions. The Australian national flag will be flown at half-mast on Sunday on all Commonwealth buildings, and I encourage others to follow suit. This has been a terrible loss to the people of Australia, to the victims and to their families. All of us have been touched and all of us are diminished by it. I encourage all Australians to take part in the day of national mourning.</DOC>

 - We now hold serious concerns for 119 Australians. We have a high degree of certainty that 30 are dead but, as has been indicated, the nation should prepare itself for a mounting death toll. Our Ambassador to Indonesia, Rick Smith, is on his way to Bali to take charge of the operation in Bali. We now have 24 federal and state police working on this in Bali, and we have another 16 arriving today in order to assist. I can understand the frustration of loved ones and relatives about identifying the victims and bringing their remains home. In fact, I met a grieving father at Sydney airport last night. I would ask the relatives, in their time of grief, to also bear in mind, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, that we need rigorous Interpol standards to ensure that no mistakes are made in identifying the victims. The AFP has advised that human remains are still being found at the scene. The identification in relation to the Childers backpackers disaster took two weeks, so it could still be some considerable time before there has been full identification.A missing persons registration centre was established in Bali yesterday, which is collecting personal details of those missing and, where possible, DNA samples from family members, and facilitating counselling. Yesterday the government announced a reward of $2 million to encourage the provision of information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the terrorist attack. Medical assistance is proceeding in terms of medical supplies, cash grants and, still, evacuation, with one Balinese patient evacuated to Darwin last night. As I have already indicated, there will be a memorial service on Sunday for the day of mourning, which Australians are encouraged to take part in. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will be attending a memorial service this afternoon as part of their trip to Bali.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. As I told the House yesterday, the scale of the operation in Bali is really quite enormous, and as the Acting Prime Minister has just indicated the disaster victim identification task is also enormous. Over and above what I reported yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs have concluded their discussions with authorities in Indonesia. Out of that trip has come an important agreement to establish a joint investigation and intelligence team to investigate the bombings. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the directors-general of ASIO and ASIS have remained in Indonesia to finalise the arrangements to ensure that the very best Australian and Indonesian expertise is applied to this task. The Federal Police and the Indonesian National Police enjoy a well-established and highly cooperative relationship; they have worked together for many years. Evidence of that relationship can be seen through the memorandum of understanding which was signed in Perth on 13 June this year. The MOU provides the basis for the close working relationship enjoyed by the Indonesian National Police and the AFP in combating transnational crime in general, and it identifies terrorism as a key focus for these collaborative efforts.The latest advice I have received - it is very recent - is that there are now 58 AFP and ASIO officers and state and territory police in Bali assisting the Indonesian National Police with the many aspects of the investigation. As I indicated yesterday, there are among them disaster victim identification experts. I understand another contingent of officers, numbering something like 16 and mainly comprising disaster victim identification experts, is to join the others in Indonesia shortly. The numbers in the AFP and ASIO teams are likely to change on a daily basis or even more than once a day, as different aspects of the investigation are focused upon.As I said yesterday, the scale of this investigation is monumental. It will be assisted by travellers providing information. Already thousands of travellers returning from Bali have been interviewed by the police, and thousands of questionnaires provided by the police have been collected. We have great confidence in the skills of the AFP, state and territory police and ASIO officers who are engaged in this task. We are very grateful as a government for their efforts and we wish them well in what must be an awful task.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The question he raises is an important one, and this whole issue is a very legitimate one. After the events of 12 October, one of my first tasks was to review the travel advisories that had been sent out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in cooperation with the embassy in Jakarta. I have also taken time to look at travel advisories sent out by other governments.To understand this issue of travel advisories, first of all it is important to appreciate that there are essentially three different types of travel advice. Firstly, there is the global advice; regardless of what country somebody may be proposing to visit, there is advice for them. In Australia we call that the Travellers Bulletin, on global issues. The United States has an equivalent called the Worldwide Caution and issued by the State Department. Secondly, Australia has specific Travel Advices, and the United States has an equivalent, although they are not called travel advices but Travel Warnings. Thirdly, our embassies issue from time to time Embassy Bulletins, and the United States embassies do the same thing. Their equivalents to the embassy bulletins are called Embassy Notices.On 20 September, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a travel advice for Indonesia that specifically referred to the general threat of bombing by terrorists. Bearing in mind that we had no information about the bomb attack that did take place, of course there was no reference to that specific incident, tragically - and of course, if anyone had known about it in advance, then in our case we would have moved heaven and earth to ensure that Australians were nowhere near Bali and particularly that part of Bali. In any case, on 20 September a travel advice for Indonesia was issued which did refer to the general threat of bombings by terrorists. I think the Prime Minister referred to this yesterday. I will remind the House: Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted. In view of the ongoing risk of terrorist activity, Australians should maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.I had a look at the equivalent travel advice issued by the Americans. Prior to 12 October, their most recent travel warning specific to Indonesia was on 23 November 2001, so it was rather old. Actually, I was surprised that it had been so long since they had issued an update. In relation to their embassy notices, on 26 September 2002 the American Embassy in Jakarta issued an embassy notice that stated:Americans and Westerners should avoid large gatherings, and locations known to cater primarily to a Western clientele such as certain bars, restaurants and tourist areas.I have noticed that some in the media have reported that the Americans had specifically referred to Bali. I met with the American Ambassador in Jakarta yesterday, and he explained to me - and this is borne out by an examination of their documents - that neither in their travel advice nor in their embassy notices was there any reference at all to Bali.On 3 October, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta issued an embassy bulletin, which as I said is more or less the equivalent of the American embassy notice, and it was somewhat similar to the American embassy notice. It said:As in the past around religious holidays, militant groups may conduct intimidatory activity against night clubs, bars and other places where expatriates are known to gather....				...				...Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted.From 3 to 4 October, I know, was a period of a religious holiday; 12 October was not, as far as I know, a religious holiday. We are coming into the period of Ramadan, but this did refer to `around religious holidays'. It makes, of course, very similar points to the American embassy notice.In relation to the worldwide advisory, the Australian travel bulletin - or, as the Americans say, the worldwide cautions - on 10 October the Americans issued a worldwide caution which was focused on a specific threat made against American interests as contained within the then most recent Osama bin Laden tape - which members will recall, I am sure, because it was substantially in the media. The bin Laden threat was reflected in the US caution of 10 October and a US FBI alert of 9 October, and these were then referred to in a DFAT travel bulletin, which is the equivalent of the US worldwide caution, issued on 11 October Australian time. It was entitled, `Terrorist threat to United States interests in United States and overseas'. That bulletin was, as these bulletins are, posted on the DFAT web site. It said:In light of the warnings by the United States Government, Australian travellers and residents overseas are advised to remain alert to their own security.The US caution was global so, of course, it covered every country in the world. It did not single out Indonesia, any part of Indonesia or any other country, let alone any specific province or city.With regard to the threat to Australia's interests in Indonesia, DFAT had already issued a travel advice on 20 September which specifically referred to maintaining personal vigilance. As I have pointed out, an embassy bulletin of 3 October warned about intimidatory activity against nightclubs and the like. As the House will recall, yesterday the Prime Minister said that, with regard to the intelligence, there was a generic threat to a number of cities in provinces in Indonesia. This included Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Kalimantan, Lombok, Bali and Sumatra. I think the opposition saw this intelligence material last night - at least, I think the Leader of the Opposition did. He, of course, is not here today, but I think he saw this intelligence material last night. The point here is that this threat was not only non-specific and broad based across Indonesia but also, importantly, contingent upon the arrest of certain individuals. Of course, those arrests did not occur and have not occurred.  That, to the best of our knowledge at the moment, is the full extent of the Australian intelligence that might refer to threats in Bali. But, as the Prime Minister said yesterday - and, I think, very sensibly - all the intelligence material is being referred to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and he will obviously examine the material to see whether the intelligence community and my department have responded appropriately.But, as the US government stated on 15 October, the United States itself had no specific information about the planned bombing in Bali and that, of course, if it had had such information, it would have issued a public warning regarding the potential danger. It did not issue such a warning; indeed, one United States Embassy staff member who I met a day or so ago had been holidaying in Bali on the weekend of 12-13 October at the time the bombing took place.As the Prime Minister has stated in the House, like the US government, the Australian government had no specific information. Having reviewed the warnings contained in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advice of 20 September, the embassy's Jakarta bulletin of 3 October and the DFAT travel bulletin - the global travel bulletin - on 11 October and having looked at the intelligence material, I think they were appropriate on the basis of the information that was available at the time. I choose my words carefully, because the great tragedy here is that no intelligence agency, to the best of our knowledge - including, by the way, the Indonesian intelligence agencies - had any foreknowledge of this bomb attack taking place. Obviously, if we had had that foreknowledge, we would have been able to take appropriate action.Mr Speaker, I apologise for taking a bit of time on this issue, but I am sure honourable members are interested in it; it is a reasonable and important question. Let me just say in conclusion that today I have announced that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advisory will be upgraded for Indonesia yet again. The decision to amend our travel advice today is based on disturbing new information of generic threats to Australians and Australian interests in Indonesia. We have been recommending since the Bali atrocity that Australians defer all non-essential travel to Indonesia. We are now recommending that all Australians in Indonesia who are concerned about their security consider departure. In particular, short-term visitors whose presence in Indonesia is non-essential should depart. We urge Australians to exercise extreme caution, particularly in commercial and public areas known to be frequented by foreigners, such as clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, and, importantly, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas. The government also strongly advises Australians in Indonesia to monitor carefully developments that might affect their safety. We are also revising our travel advice notices for a range of countries in South-East Asia to highlight the need for vigilance, given the ongoing risk of terrorist activity.Although I was not here yesterday, I understand that the member for Griffith asked the Minister for Trade if a number of travel advisories could be tabled from a number of different countries. Let me apologise to the House that it has not been possible yet to get the back copies of the British and, I think, Canadian travel advisories. We have to get those from the post because they have been replaced by new travel advisories and the web site does not have the old travel advisories on it that the department can find. What we have been able to get is the United States travel advisories, which I know will be of particular interest. I am certainly happy to table those American travel advisories. I think they will be of substantial interest to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for his question and his obvious concern, as with other members of this place in relation to the families of victims of this tragedy in Indonesia. At the current time, as I have indicated over the last few days in answers to questions, the state, territory and Commonwealth health authorities are working closely together. Our primary aim, as I am sure all honourable members would understand, is to provide for those victims who have been injured, and in some cases quite severely injured, and to provide for the treatment of burns and a range of other injuries in relation to those people.One of the other things we are doing is trying to put together a full list of people because, as is well known by honourable members, people with injuries have returned to Australia by commercial flights. It was only those in the most serious situations that returned to Australia by way of the evacuation carried out by the Royal Australian Air Force. We are in the process, in cooperation with states and territories, of trying to provide that full list so that a full range of services can be provided to these people. As for specific details about any assistance for families in those circumstances, that is something which the government would give consideration to, but I will take that aspect of the question on notice and come back to the honourable member.</DOC>

 - Can I begin by responding to the remarks made by the member for Griffith at the end of my previous answer. I did not mention it, but I did table the former Australian travel advisories, so obviously we can easily access those.I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. As the House knows, I came back this morning from Jakarta and yesterday I met in Jakarta with President Megawati and Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. I also saw the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Bambang Yudhoyono; the Minister for Justice and Human Rights, Yusril Ihza Mahendra; the commander of the Indonesian armed forces, General Sutarto; as well as a number of other people. I was greeted graciously by the President and her ministers, as was Senator Ellison, who travelled with me, and the senior Australian delegation. The House will be pleased to hear that they passed on their deep condolences to the families of the victims of the Bali incident and to the Australian people as well. They showed great concern and grace. While I was in Jakarta I had a sense that in Indonesia there is as great a sense of shock about this incident as there is here in Australia. That sense of shock is carried by everybody, from the President downwards.Obviously one of our key objectives in Jakarta was to ensure that those who are responsible for this simply appalling act are hunted down and brought to justice. I was very encouraged by the commitment given to me by the Indonesian government that they would do all they could to achieve that objective. Between us, we have agreed to establish a joint investigation and intelligence team. That team will be formed under the auspices of the memorandum of understanding on international terrorism, which was signed by the Prime Minister and President Megawati in February of this year. As it has turned out, that memorandum of understanding has been an extraordinarily important and useful framework for going forward on this particular issue.I have instructed senior officials from our intelligence agencies, the Federal Police and my department to remain in Indonesia today to finalise arrangements for the joint team and to ensure that the very best of Australian, as well as Indonesian, expertise is applied to this crucially important task. The establishment of a joint team will formalise the joint investigation that is already under way between Australia and Indonesia through our police and intelligence agencies. We will also hold discussions with other countries which are offering to support this activity, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Japan. They all have people at the moment assisting in Bali and in Jakarta. While I was in Bali I met with the director of the main hospital in Denpasar, and also with the director of the morgue. In the space of several hours the hospitals, including the private hospitals, in Bali did their very best to deal with an emergency that went way beyond their expectations, way beyond their supplies and way beyond their capacity. I did express on behalf of the Australian people my sincere gratitude for the simply extraordinary efforts of the hospitals, of the doctors, of the nurses and, by the way, of the many volunteers who assisted on the night of the 12th, on the morning of the 13th and beyond. This effort by all those people continues.I think it is very important that Australia does what it can to help the Indonesians who suffered from this disaster as well as, obviously, first and foremost looking after our own people. So I told the hospital and I told others I met within Indonesia that we would provide substantial aid to the hospital to help it replenish medical supplies and to ensure that it has appropriate equipment. I did say while I was there that if there are Indonesians in the hospital who are suffering very greatly and would rather be moved to a hospital in Australia which might have greater capacity to deal with their particular injuries then we would be happy to facilitate that. It is important that we build on the spirit of cooperation that was shown by the people of Bali on the night of the 12th and beyond and that we do what we can to look after them as well to reciprocate their kindness and generosity.I will conclude by saying that one of the things that really struck me in Indonesia -  and I have been the foreign minister for six and a half years and have seen some interesting developments in our bilateral relationship over that period - was the outpouring of tributes from the Indonesian people towards Australia and Australians. It might surprise and would certainly please the House to hear that. For example, if you go to the Australian consulate in Bali, there are wreaths laid all across the front of the consulate. There are people coming up the whole time there, laying wreaths and praying. Last night when I was in Jakarta not only did I notice the enormous number of wreaths in front of the Australian Embassy but there was a spontaneous candlelight vigil by Indonesians in front of our embassy. I think this is an event that has brought our two peoples closer together. I think it is a sorrow we both share but on top of that it is a very great determination we both share to bring to justice those people who were responsible for this simply appalling crime.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Yes, one of the things that the government has considered is putting in place some kind of training for medical services and upgrading of medical facilities in Bali, which would provide an ongoing opportunity for doctors to be trained and for treatment to be given. I am not in a position to announce any outcome in relation to that, but that has certainly been one of the matters that the government has been considering.In addition to that, the government has been considering a lasting memorial; if you like, a place of pilgrimage that the relatives and friends of victims, and other Australians, could go to, which would be an acknowledgment of the terrible loss that Australia has suffered. Obviously, while the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are in Bali they will have the opportunity to engage in further discussions, but I can assure the honourable member that that is one of the matters that is under discussion. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question in relation to these tragic events. I also join at the outset with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his comments and pay tribute to not only the work of health workers in Bali but the magnificent work which has been undertaken by doctors and nurses and a range of other allied health professionals in dealing with the consequences of this tragedy here in Australia. I reiterate in response to the honourable member for Boothby - as I did in an answer to a question from the member for Greenway - that there has been and will be ongoing discussion not only between health ministers at the Commonwealth, state and territory level but obviously also between officials of departments in relation to this particular matter, and that will continue. The liaising with the state health authorities has continued in relation to the availability of hospital treatment and particularly in relation to the burns patients who were victims of the disaster.One of the matters I referred to yesterday was the offer to also treat victims from Indonesia and Bali in Australia if required, and that offer has been made to the Indonesian authorities. To date, I can indicate that one Indonesian victim of this tragedy arrived in Darwin for treatment last night. I am informed as of this morning that that person is in a serious but stable condition. Unfortunately, another Indonesian person who was identified for evacuation to Australia for treatment died before being airlifted to Australia. Ultimately, however, the decision about whether or not further evacuation of Indonesian nationals to Australia will occur is a matter for the Indonesian authorities in relation to their assessment of the situation.I also inform the House that, on behalf of the states and territories, the government has agreed to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service exporting albumin to Bali to treat casualties from the terrorist bombing. I am advised that that will take place shortly. As I said earlier in an answer to a question, the government is also assisting in the compilation of a full list of people who have been admitted to Australian hospitals as a result of injuries received in Bali.It is also significant that there has been significant goodwill and effort displayed by many private companies and community organisations across Australia in assisting the victims of the tragedy in Bali and their families. There are also offers of support and support being provided by pharmaceutical companies and medical supply manufacturers who have provided resources to aid groups for the Indonesian victims of this crisis. I am advised that one pharmaceutical company has agreed to supply to Australian hospitals its latest product - asepsis for the treatment of the Bali victims - for free. As I mentioned yesterday, the Australian Private Hospitals Association, in conjunction with Mayne Health and Catholic Health Australia, have also indicated their readiness to assist with private hospital facilities. As I said yesterday, I understand that that offer has been taken up in relation to the private hospital in Darwin. Overall, I hope that provides some update for honourable members in relation to the response by health authorities across Australia to this tragedy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lingiari for his question. The short answer is that we have made some changes today on the basis of new information that has become available to us. Let me just explain to the House how the travel advisories work. They are basically adjusted from time to time on the basis of information made available to us from a number of sources, including from intelligence sources - obviously it is sensitive to talk about that, but we must reflect our concerns from intelligence in travel advisories. We also, from time to time, make public statements to try to publicise even more those particular concerns. We also structure our travel advisories very much on the basis of advice given by the post itself - in the case of your question, our High Commission in Kuala Lumpur or our High Commission in Singapore - and they are constantly reviewed by the mission and by the consular officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They upgrade them when their perception is that there may be a change, either positive or negative, in the threat assessment or the circumstances for Australians, obviously on the basis of information made available to them - and, hopefully, they typically get it right. That is not to pretend that they could ever be flawless but, anyway, they endeavour to do that.We have changed our assessments a bit for South-East Asia more generally - so that does include those countries - today, on the basis of our concerns that the security environment there is worse than it was prior to the events of 12 October. But we always try to be cautious. I often say this to the department: `Always try to be very cautious. Try not to take into consideration' - this is a very important point, I think - `diplomatic issues.' In the end, governments quite often say to you - not necessarily in the region; often beyond - `We don't like your travel advisory very much. It's putting people off coming and visiting our country.' And I say to them, `Look, my first responsibility is to the security of the Australian people. I don't think I as the minister should be intervening in just changing the department's travel advisories for some sort of international political reason.' That is why they are or are not upgraded, and it is why there has been some upgrading in South-East Asia today.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Cook for his question. Qantas have four scheduled services that have operated since Sunday and have provided seven additional services since Monday, bringing home from Bali a total of 2,500 travellers up until midnight last night. They have also transported medical specialists, as well as Qantas's own doctors and nurses. They have waived all conditions on tickets to Australia from Bali. Qantas are also carrying customers from other airlines with tickets from Denpasar to Australia at no additional cost, and there will be no penalty to amend, defer or cancel travel to Bali or Indonesia.Garuda have provided two extra services on Sunday, with increased capacity on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I am advised by Garuda that they have transported approximately 4,000 people to Australia on Garuda flights. They have also transported medical supplies, such as linen, water, crutches and saline solution, to Bali. They have transported 4,000 kilos on Monday, 1,000 kilos on Tuesday, 12,000 kilos on Wednesday and 8,000 kilos today. They have also transported additional supplies for the Balinese hospital, and I understand they are leaving later today. Garuda have also indicated that there will be no penalty to amend, defer or cancel travel to Bali or Indonesia. It is important to note that there are other airlines, obviously, operating to and from Denpasar to other parts of Asia. There is an unknown number of Australians that may have flown out to Singapore or other destinations on other airlines. I have been advised by Qantas that those waiting to come home as soon as possible are being accommodated wherever possible, and Qantas have undertaken to us to provide additional services should it become necessary. In the light of the Minister for Foreign Affairs's departmental reassessment of the travel warning in relation to Indonesia, the issue will be looked at again. Of course, additional evacuation services have been provided for injured victims. The RAAF has been operating C130 and P3 Orion aircraft to assist in medical evacuations. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has also provided interstate medical transport, transferring serious burns patients from Darwin to Brisbane for treatment. I know all Australians are very grateful for the work of both Qantas and Garuda. Qantas, in particular, have indicated that they will do whatever they can to accommodate the concerns of those who are travelling to and from Bali during these difficult moments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question and recognise that the University of New England is a very good example of a fine regional university. It specialises in research in beef, wool and rural futures amongst other things. In reviewing Australian higher education and thinking about the role it will play in driving our economic and social development, including our engagement in Asia, one of the key things the government is looking at is research. There will be $2.77 billion invested by the Australian government this year in research in Australian higher education. I can certainly reassure the House that absolutely nothing will be done to undermine the role of research that is undertaken in regional universities. In particular, we are determined to see that research is of a very high quality and that it serves the interests and the social and economic wellbeing of people in those regional communities. Out of this reform process I put it to the House that universities and campuses in regions of this country will be very significant winners.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. As indicated previously to the House and announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Australia's chief contribution to the humanitarian aid has been the $300,000 emergency assistance to Indonesia's health services in Bali, consisting of a $200,000 grant to the Indonesian Red Cross and related medical services, and around another $100,000 worth of medical consumables, including intravenous fluids, antibiotic injections and sterile bandages that have been requested. AusAID, the Australian government's international aid agency, is being informed by Australia's embassy officials in Indonesia as to the country's humanitarian response to emergency aid arising from this attack. In turn, AusAID is providing advice to Australian government departments on appropriate medical support, including the importance of checking with the authorities in Bali if the items and services are needed and can be utilised.Initial Australian funded medical supplies arrived on a Qantas flight and additional flights are anticipated. Items that have been provided include sterile bandages, IV fluids, analgesics and burns creams, which have been dispatched to hospitals. I also understand the Australian government is exploring a request from the Indonesian plastic surgery foundation for essential equipment. If this is endorsed by the Indonesian authorities, it will be supplied.We are continuing to monitor the situation closely, including the need for additional humanitarian items. Considerable quantities of medical supplies are arriving in Bali from private contributions and other donors. The largest quantities are actually coming from Australia. There is a real risk of inappropriate items swamping the Bali services, and refrigeration of perishable items is an issue. I understand that with Indonesia's own response and that of other donors and private contributions, additional material is not warranted at precisely this time. Many Australians are asking themselves the very real question: what can I do and how can I help in this circumstance? One way in which they can help, if they are able to, is by making a cash donation. This can be done through a number of appeals such as the Australian Red Cross appeal line, which people can contact on 1800 811 700, or the Overseas Pharmaceutical Aid for Life in Adelaide, which is accepting cash donations as well. There are also obviously a number of other national teams overseas, but this is one way in which Australians can contribute in this circumstance.I will add one further piece of information which really responds to the question asked to me earlier by the member for Greenway. In response to his question about travel and accommodation, the government will pay air fares and accommodation costs to enable Australians injured in Bali and recovering in hospital in Australia to be reunited with family members. This is for families who live a long way from hospitals where their injured relatives are being treated and where they would have difficulty paying for the air travel and accommodation. These matters are being coordinated through the Department of Family and Community Services and details of the ex gratia payment will be appropriately communicated to the victims' families. The Commonwealth is considering other measures that may be put in place to address other domestic issues as they arise. There is a toll-free number which family members can use if they wish to access this facility or obtain further information. For the benefit of members and the Australian public generally, the number is 1800 002 214.</DOC>

 - It is based on intelligence material that we received a number of hours ago, not a number of days ago. If the honourable member wishes to come and see me this afternoon before we all take off to go home, I would be happy to tell him a bit about it. I think that might be the best way to handle it. I am not aware of whether the Americans have changed their travel advisory today. They obviously changed their travel advisory straight after the events of 12 October. You would naturally expect that. You are asking me to be rather precise about what the Americans know and do not know at what time. But I will tell you that this change to our travel advisory would not have played into the considerations of the American travel advisory at that time - that is, Monday. That information would not have been available to the Americans at that time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. The government is committed to doing everything it can to prevent and deter terrorism and to prosecute the evil perpetrators of terrorist acts. Our resolve to do that is unwavering. The recent evil perpetrated against Australians in Bali has brought the threat of terrorism closer to our shores and impacted within those shores. The government has passed a significant package of antiterrorism legislation and thereby created a new suite of terrorist offences. The government has acted to enhance the ability of ASIO to gather intelligence to assist it to deter and prevent terrorist acts. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 was introduced into the House on 21 March this year. The House passed the bill, including a number of government amendments, on 24 September. This bill is a vital element of the government's counter-terrorism legislative package.  Let me remind the House of the intent of the bill. It is not designed for law enforcement purposes. New terrorism offences for that purpose were created in other parts of our counter-terrorism package which was passed in June. Our key aim with the ASIO bill is to find out as much as we can about potential terrorist attacks so we can stop them before people are harmed. This bill will strengthen our ability to do just that. At present, ASIO is empowered to seek search warrants, computer access warrants, tracking device warrants, and telecommunications interception warrants and to inspect postal articles. But ASIO cannot obtain a warrant to question a person. In order to prevent and deter terrorist acts it is necessary that ASIO has the tools it needs to gather relevant intelligence. The bill does that by establishing a warrant regime to allow ASIO to question those who may have information relevant to its investigations.The bill has already been examined by two parliamentary committees: the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The parliamentary joint committee made 15 recommendations for changes to the bill. Both of the committees, which included senior Labor representatives, supported the passage of the bill with amendments. The government took on board the majority of the recommendations, explaining and providing alternatives to those recommendations that could not be accepted because they would have undermined the purpose of the bill. The bill is not about punishing individuals; it is about gathering intelligence. It is about community safety. The government is mindful that we must not erode civil rights in the name of security. That is why the bill has such extensive safeguards. But let us not forget that terrorism is a deadly assault on the basic human rights of people around the world.The Leader of the Opposition acknowledged in the House on Monday that the most effective way to prevent terrorism is to have good intelligence about terrorists and their operations. The intelligence that could be gathered under the bill would be invaluable and is exactly the type of information the Leader of the Opposition knows we need. However, this morning in the Senate, Labor moved a motion to refer the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It is disappointing that the opposition has chosen to delay the legislation by moving a motion to refer it to yet another parliamentary committee. It is important we arm ourselves with strong tools to prevent and deter terrorism. We cannot afford to delay this bill any further. I have repeatedly offered, including in writing, to discuss any remaining concerns with the leadership team of the opposition. Rather than referring it to yet another committee, I invite the opposition, yet again, to sit down and discuss concerns with us. This legislation was not developed on a whim; it was part of a comprehensive government response to needs clearly identified in a review of Australia's counter-terrorism arrangements after September 11. I urge the opposition to reconsider its position and allow us to strengthen ASIO's ability to gather intelligence so we can identify and prevent terrorist acts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I was returning from overseas when I heard of the tragedy on Sunday morning, and I was in touch with departmental officials that day in expectation that there might well be a requirement for the evacuation of people to Australia for medical treatment and that that would require putting in place arrangements to ensure that people who may have lost documents - as documents may have been destroyed - and people from other countries who may require assistance to access Australia would have special arrangements. The tragedy of it all as it unfolded revealed that there were at least 24 nationalities amongst those who were included in the fatalities. As a result of the need for prompt action, my department responded by streamlining the border processes to facilitate the evacuation of critically injured Australians and non-Australians. I am aware that 15 non-Australians have been evacuated via the military and charter flights that have been in place, including a number of German, British, New Zealand, Canadian, Swedish and South African nationals.As the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned, assurances have also been given that we would medivac those Indonesian nationals who were unable to get adequate treatment in Indonesia. As was mentioned earlier by the Minister for Ageing, last night an Indonesian woman was transferred from Bali to the Royal Darwin Hospital, her condition having been seen to be very serious and treatment here being seen as appropriate for that condition. Another person who it was judged would also be able to benefit from such treatment unfortunately passed away before the evacuation could occur.My department has made available additional staff to assist with the government's total response. Three additional immigration officials were sent immediately to Denpasar. They have been assisting the consular-general and other agencies on the ground, as well as assisting with producing appropriate documents. Again, extra staff of my department have been called to Australian airports to ensure that passengers arriving both commercially and through charter flights were processed sensitively and were able to move through the airport as quickly as possible. The special arrangements will continue. We will judge with the Indonesian government if there is a need to respond with further evacuations for medical treatment, and appropriate arrangements will be put in place to achieve that outcome.As one who has not been personally affected, nevertheless one is touched when your own family and their friends are. In the case of my children, friends from school have lost or appear to have lost a loved one. I am sure most Australians have been affected in much the same way. I am gratified, having been in this House for such a long period of time, to see the way in which people have responded - I think appropriately - at a very crucial time in our nation's history.</DOC>

 - We are unable to list Jemaah Islamiah because it has not been listed by the United Nations Security Council. As the Prime Minister indicated, we are pursuing the listing of that organisation. It has been on the agenda for some time, but there has been some resistance to it. As to other organisations, the process involves confirming the listing by the United Nations Security Council, an assessment then on the basis of which the Attorney-General is obliged to form an opinion that the organisations are terrorist organisations and then a listing by regulation. That process has been under way and I actually have documents in my office in relation to it. We are proposing to list six organisations but, as I said, because we do not have the power to list of our own motion - except through the United Nations Security Council - we will not be listing Jemaah Islamiah until the United Nations Security Council does.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, before answering could I welcome to the House a visiting delegation of senior editors from Indonesia. Most major Jakarta daily newspapers are represented and the delegation has been here as part of a program funded by the Australia-Indonesia Institute. It is the fourth in a series of exchange programs involving Indonesian editors.Nothing could have displayed more vividly than the Bali bombing the fact that Indonesia's security is Australia's security and that the security in Asia is an issue for the security of Australia. Australians are involved in working and living all the way through Asia, and Asia's security is their security, it is their lives. We have a legitimate interest, as do the countries of Asia, in the security of the Asian region. This is a problem that we must work on together. In the immediate aftermath of the Bali bombing, we will strengthen our engagements with Indonesia in law enforcement and security. We have a common interest, Australia and Indonesia, in disrupting the organisation of terrorism. We have a common interest in disrupting the financial support of terrorism. We have a common interest in freezing the assets of people who engage in terrorist activity. This is most obvious in our relationship with Indonesia as a result of the Bali events, but it is wider than just Bali - this is now an issue for the whole of our region, and particularly South-East Asia. We are now receiving reports that a bomb has ripped through a department store in the southern Philippines city of Zamboanga, injuring up to 10 people. We do not believe that any foreigners have been injured as a result, and reports are still sketchy. The city is on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, which has been the subject of a number of terrorist attacks over a long period of time. It brings home to us that, not just in Bali, Indonesia but in the Philippines and in other countries of the region, the common security problems of Asia are the security problems of Australia. Just as we have responded with expertise and just as we have responded with heightened cooperation in relation to Bali, so the government intends to engage in a security sense to heighten our links in the region generally, for the region's sake and also for Australia and Australians' sake. The lesson we take out of this terrible tragedy is to heighten our engagement because Asia's security is Australia's security.</DOC>

 - I do not have the American travel advisory with me, but I can say that as far as the Australian travel advisory is concerned the reason that it has been changed, as I said in answer to a previous question, is that we have had new information made available to us in very recent times. I am not going to get into what information the Americans have or do not have available to them, but this is information that became available to us in recent hours - not in recent days - and on that basis it has changed the assessment of the safety of Australians in Indonesia.I am not responsible for the American travel advisories - that is beyond me. It is a matter for the American Embassy in Jakarta, for Ambassador Boyce and for the State Department to consider what they should do in terms of adjusting their own travel advisories. Other than that, you are getting into the question of what information do we and the Americans exchange with each other, and I am not prepared to canvass that publicly except to say that it is widely known that we exchange an enormous amount of information with each other.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. Very briefly, I can inform the House that today my department issued a formal advice to Public Service agencies, headed up `Bali tragedy - helping employees'. This advice noted that in some Public Service workplaces there could be some issues arising from the Bali tragedy. Employees could have friends or family who were involved in the tragedy and they might need to take time off. The advice noted that the Australian Public Service had a long tradition of supporting staff who need to be away from work as a result of personal or community emergencies. The advice states:Agencies will no doubt apply these provisions - that is, the provisions of the agreements in the Public Service - flexibly and sensitively to appropriately support employees affected by the tragedy.This is very good advice that my department has provided to Public Service managers. I would commend that advice to Public Service managers and indeed to all employers at this time.</DOC>

 - Let me say at the outset that the opportunity that I had, accompanied by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to visit Bali last Thursday evening and Friday was I hope of some help and reassurance and - however inadequate - comfort to the people who have been so sadly affected by these terrible events. My dominant emotion was one of great humility to find in the face of such dreadful adversity people displaying enormous strength and enormous courage.I know how upsetting it is that the remains have not all been repatriated. Indeed, the current information I have is that at this stage the remains of only one has been repatriated, but more should be, I hope, soon. I cannot tell the House or the Leader of the Opposition exactly how long it is going to take. He was present of course at all of the briefings I had. I should point out to the House that I invited the Leader of the Opposition to all of the briefings that I had from the officials in Bali, and I think it is fair to say that he and the Deputy Prime Minister and I operated as a team in Bali. We were there on behalf of the entire nation; we were not there representing individual political parties. I hope the House would see the visit in that context.The process of identification will take quite some time. It is hard for the reasons I outlined to the House last week. I can only repeat again my profound understanding to people who are waiting on the repatriation of the remains of a child, a mother, a father, a brother, a sister or a mate. The latest advice I have is that serious concerns are now held for 92 Australians: 41 from New South Wales, 23 from Victoria, eight from Queensland, 15 from Western Australia, three from South Australia, one from Tasmania and one overseas based Australian. DFAT and AFP staff continue to work to reconcile all missing cases reported by families and friends. Resolving the number of unaccounted for Australians will, of course, remain the top priority. AFP and state police officers in Bali and in Australia are working as quickly as possible to expedite identification and repatriation of remains. Forty-three federal and state police are working on victim identification in Bali. State police are contacting relatives in Australia of potential victims to obtain information to assist in the identification process.My understanding is that the process of contact and collection of DNA relevant material is already very well advanced. As a result I believe that, after an inevitable delay at the beginning because of the difficulty of immediate identification, the process can expect to pick up a little speed. But I should warn the House that we could reach the situation where some remains are never identified. That is a difficult thing to have to say, but it remains the case. I know that some of the families to whom I have spoken were themselves already contemplating that prospect, and it will only add to their grief. As identification occurs and people are repatriated, those who are left will assume a greater concern regarding that possibility. I do understand the sense of frustration but, unfortunately, the process has to go on to avoid the possibility of mistaken identification.There are another 25 Australian Federal Police officers working on the investigation in Bali; and there is a total of 109 Australian police, from various forces, in Bali. There is a memorandum of understanding covering the joint investigation that we signed with the Indonesian police last week. The Australian Federal Police have collected 6,000 questionnaires from those at Bali at the time of the bombing to obtain information on the attack, and they are following up with interviews of 450 people. They have made good progress so far, but it is quite impossible to predict how long the investigation will take.AusAID has been in close contact on the ground with the Bali medical authorities. Twenty-two tonnes of medical supplies from a range of sources have arrived in Bali since the bomb outrage. Local hospitals in Bali do not need any more medical supplies at this stage. AusAID will continue to assist with any specific medical needs, as it did with the provision of plastic surgery equipment and training, and this assistance will arrive this week.I think all of us would have been seized of the spontaneous response that Australians gave to the national day of mourning yesterday. In different parts of the country, in different ways, according to their own particular desires, Australians marked this terrible event in a respectful, united, sensitive fashion, and it reflects enormous credit on our country that we can respond in that fashion with such genuine, heartfelt feeling.As I announced last week, there will be an interdenominational national memorial service in the Great Hall of Parliament House on Thursday, 24 October, at 10 a.m. The House will assemble at 9.30 a.m. and then, by agreement between the government and the opposition, it will be immediately adjourned for the rest of the day, and parliament will not meet again until November. The families of those affected by the Bali tragedy have been invited to attend, and the government will cover the travel and accommodation costs of two family members to attend the memorial service. Arrangements can be made through the Ceremonial and Hospitality Unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I will announce further details of the service tomorrow, but I can indicate to the House that Bishop Tom Frame, who is the senior chaplain of the Australian Defence Force, has been invited by the government to officiate. I also inform the House that the service will include an address from myself and an address from the Leader of the Opposition to reflect in full the completely bipartisan character of the occasion. Other arrangements relating to the service will be announced shortly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and I appreciate the interest he shows in the travel advisories in relation to Indonesia. As the House is aware, we have changed over the last week the travel advisories for Indonesia on a number of occasions. On each occasion these changes have been made to reflect information that has come particularly to intelligence authorities and to other Australian government officials about what could be possible threats to Westerners and, in our case, obviously, particularly Australians. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has been briefed on some of this information today.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is continuing to recommend that Australians defer non-essential travel to Indonesia, that all Australians in Indonesia who are concerned about their safety should consider leaving and that those who are there on a short-term basis and whose presence is not essential should depart. We also, to be specific about that, include Bali - that is, Australians should defer travel to Bali. Australian visitors in Bali should consider advancing their departures on available flights, and I understand that seats are available on these flights. In the meantime, they should remain in their hotels; avoid public places, where possible; and call home to advise families of their wellbeing - it is very important they do that so that the families are aware of where they are and what they are doing.The government has authorised, on a voluntary basis, the departure of non-essential staff and all dependants from our various posts in Indonesia and, in particular, our embassy in Jakarta. This is not to say that these posts, our consulates and our embassy will be closing. There still will be substantial numbers of staff available at those missions.Australians should also be particularly careful in Jakarta, in Balikpapan, in Surabaya and in Yogyakarta. More generally, Australians in Indonesia should exercise extreme caution and avoid commercial and public areas known to be frequented by foreigners: places such as clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas. We have received reports that certain up-market entertainment areas may be targeted. Also, based on new information, we now note that these tourist areas include resorts outside of the major cities, and historical and cultural locations including the temple of Borobodur.The honourable member asked about the arrest and detention of the extremist leader Abu Bakar Bashir and whether this had any implications for the safety of Australians in Indonesia. The detention of Abu Bakar Bashir is welcomed by the Australian government and we look forward to the Indonesians successfully questioning Abu Bakar Bashir with a view to obtaining information about the activities of both himself and the organisation of which he is the spiritual leader, Jemaah Islamiah. It is important that Australians and other Westerners in Indonesia understand that the detention of Abu Bakar Bashir may very well lead to a strong reaction from his supporters and supporters of other extremist organisations including the risk of public demonstrations. Although this has not happened on any significant scale yet, that is not to say that it will not in the future.So, in the context of the detention of Abu Bakar Bashir, our expectation is that there could be further detentions, further arrests of other extremist leaders in Indonesia. In those circumstances it is extremely important that Australians in Indonesia heed the travel advisories that have been issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is extremely important that they are aware of the danger of demonstrations and of possible attacks of one kind or another by militants - be they bomb attacks, gun attacks or whatever they may be. It is something that I cannot emphasise strongly enough. There are risks of these types of incidents occurring.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question and for her interest. We commend the Indonesian government for the firm action that it has been taking since 12 October in the face of the threat of terrorism. In answer to the previous question, I spoke a little bit about the detention of Abu Bakar Bashir. Very late on Friday night, President Megawati signed two emergency antiterrorism decrees. These decrees will enable Indonesia to act immediately by providing wider powers to Indonesia's law enforcement authorities to investigate suspects and prosecute those charged with terrorist crimes, including on the basis of intelligence reports. These are not powers that the Indonesian authorities had prior to the signing of the decree. Very significantly, this decree is retrospective with respect to action against the suspected perpetrators of the Bali bombings.The government welcomes this much stronger action being taken by the Indonesian government and Indonesian authorities to address terrorism. While we understand that there have been, in the past, some reservations about decrees of this kind - particularly bearing in mind Indonesia's history - nevertheless it is our view and the view of many of our allies and other regional countries, that Indonesia must act decisively and with fortitude to deal with the problem of terrorism. The signing by President Megawati of these decrees was an important step forward.As the House knows, Senator Ellison and I visited Bali and Jakarta last week and talked extensively about the priority we gave to there being immediate cooperation between Australia and Indonesia, including cooperation in bringing the perpetrators of the Bali bombings to justice. Let me say five or so days on that I am very encouraged by the positive way in which both our countries have pulled together in the wake of the terrible tragedy. As I said last week, in talks with President Megawati we agreed to establish a joint investigation and intelligence team. That joint investigation and intelligence team had an initial meeting on Friday and it has been agreed that further meetings of the team will be held this week. For our side, the team will include senior officials from our embassy in Jakarta, from ASIO, from the Department of Defence, from the Australian Federal Police as well as the Australian Defence Force.Australia and Indonesia are also cooperating very closely in their joint investigations of the Bali crime scene, and the House will be interested to know that in addition to the 30 DFAT officers in Bali there are currently more than 81 Australian police in Bali assisting with the investigation. We have 28 Defence personnel, including four chaplains and six investigators. There are six ASIO officers there to assist with the police investigations, four DIMIA staff and two AusAID staff, as well as two AusAID funded medical inventory specialists to assist particularly the hospital in Bali. There are two Federal Police psychologists there and an additional two Defence psychologists will be deployed to Bali.The point I want to make in answer to the honourable member's question is that when you look at all of these things together it has to be said that it is extremely encouraging that in the period of just over one week since the tragic bombing in Bali not only has there been good progress made within Indonesia towards addressing the question of terrorism and extremist organisations within Indonesia but also the level of cooperation between Australia and Indonesia is, as we had hoped, without precedent and extraordinarily strong. The joint commitments of our governments in particular not just to provide relief to those affected but also to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous crime are extremely strong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It was following comprehensive market testing processes earlier this year that Mayne Health Services were selected as the preferred tenderer to provide health services to the ADF personnel in Victoria for the next five years. Under the new arrangement, 86 military medical staff will be redeployed to core capability areas such as operational deployable health support units. This decision will enhance Defence's operational capability.Importantly, the statement of requirement for the tender maintains, and in some areas improves upon, current health services delivery in Victoria. Areas of improvement will include on base inpatient services at Albury-Wodonga and primary health care at RAAF Williams. The statement of requirement was developed in consultation with current ADF health service providers and client ADF unit and base commanders. The statement of requirement complies with Defence health service standards of care, including access to services, and is consistent with health industry best practice. It goes without saying that Mayne Health Services will still have access to the range of specialist health care providers currently used by Defence. This will continue to include members of the reserve forces.The benefits of this contract will include improved health service delivery, a more rational and productive use of ADF health assets and a cost saving of some $16 million. The position of Labor on these issues demonstrates a commitment to Defence capability and their legacy of mismanagement that resulted in only 40 per cent of Defence personnel being employed at the sharp end of capability. - Yes, I was. - Yes, it was.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. The House is aware that Australia is working closely with the Indonesian authorities to both identify the victims of the atrocity and hunt down those responsible. As the foreign minister has just indicated, on Friday, 18 October the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian National Police signed an agreement to form a joint Australia-Indonesia police investigation team into the Bali attacks. This followed meetings between the foreign minister and the justice minister and President Megawati Sukarnoputri and members of her ministry last week.The agreement gives the AFP equal partnership in the conduct of the investigation and builds on the already strong relationship between investigators in the two countries. It allows for things such as security of the crime scene and the taking of evidence. In addition, a decision has been made to immediately enhance the ASIO presence in Indonesia.Within 24 hours of the tragedy occurring, a multidisciplined team from Australia was on site in Bali. The AFP is actually highly experienced in complex murder and war crimes investigations and it has a mandate to investigate criminal terrorist acts. It has the experience and the ability to undertake this complex investigation.I am informed by the AFP that there are currently more than 100 Australian law enforcement, intelligence officers and specialists working in the team in Bali, including about 50 involved in identification of victims. This figure is fluid and will continue to change to meet operational requirements. So we now have a highly experienced multinational forensic and investigative team assembled in Bali, specialising in investigations, intelligence, explosives and disaster victim identification. The team includes specialists from another 10 countries who are assisting with investigations, intelligence, explosives and disaster victim identification. Some of those have actually had experience at the World Trade Centre and other sites of terrorist attack.The joint Indonesia-Australia police investigation team is continuing to work closely to determine what happened in Bali and who is responsible for the attack. I have been advised by the AFP that the crime scene is still closed and that the forensic team will be consulted before it is either partially or completely reopened. Despite initial concerns about the time it took to close the crime scene, it is yielding a considerable amount of valuable evidence, and the investigative teams in Bali and Australia are following up on a number of inquiries.While the forensic examination of the scene is ongoing, it is at this stage too early to confirm the type and number of devices used. The AFP have advised, however, that preliminary evidence suggests that two devices exploded at Paddy's Bar and the Sari Club at around 11.15 p.m. Bali time. The suggestion of further explosive devices is still being examined. The Australia-Indonesia police investigation team is treating this line of inquiry as a priority, with a thorough forensic examination expected to provide answers as it painstakingly pieces together the complex circumstances. The team is developing three-dimensional imagery of the crime scene to assist investigators in re-creating the tragic events.In addition to the crime scene investigations, a large volume of information has been received and is being processed in Australia, with witness accounts of the night providing a number of very useful leads. The number of questionnaire responses received from passengers returning to Australia now exceeds 6,000. Our investigation team reports that those questionnaires and interviews conducted to date have been extremely beneficial, with around 450 detailed witness statements to be taken. There are still approximately 100 potential witnesses in hospitals or not in a condition to be spoken to at this stage. I am advised also that it has been established that approximately 200 people were treated by Australian Defence Force personnel in Bali and discharged. The AFP has now obtained the details for these people, and they are to be traced internationally and interviewed regarding evidence that they may have.In Australia, the investigation currently involves more than 400 AFP personnel. In addition, the AFP's international network is working with overseas partners to gather evidence. Again, these numbers are fluid and are likely to grow as avenues of inquiry are pursued here and abroad. As the foreign minister said, Australia continues to work very closely and cooperatively with Indonesia and with other countries to hunt down those responsible for this atrocity. We are determined that they will be brought to justice.</DOC>

 - I understand that the question from the member for Shortland - and she will correct me if I am wrong - relates to the Department of Defence originated email that was referred to in the media over the weekend. Is that correct?  - I am not trying to be clever about this.  - There have been different descriptions given to the same communication, and I just wanted to isolate it. I naturally had that checked out and I have been advised as follows. Defence did not have any information available to suggest that there was a specific threat in Bali. Defence security staff did not have access to any material not available to and being considered by other agencies and taken into account in threat assessments and travel advisories. On the information available to me, that email is being misinterpreted, and some of the reporting of the email is not consistent with its content.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and for his ongoing interest in the consequences of this tragedy. Over the weekend, my department continued to liaise with state health authorities about the provision of hospital treatment for the victims of the Bali tragedy. As of today, I can advise the House that a total of 91 Australian and foreign national patients, excluding Indonesian nationals, are being treated in various Australian hospitals. The distribution of these patients is as follows: there are 22 in hospitals in New South Wales, nine in Victoria, 14 in Queensland, five in South Australia, 36 in Western Australia and five in the Northern Territory. The health system is coping with this unexpected and considerable increase in demand for its services, and I think that stands as a tribute to the doctors, nurses and other medical personnel in these various hospitals throughout Australia. In addition to those people, three seriously burnt Indonesian patients were flown to Darwin last Saturday. One of these patients regrettably died soon after being admitted to the Darwin Hospital, and the two other patients were transferred to Perth later that day. I am advised that their condition currently is stable.I can also advise the House that each of the state and territory health departments is providing a comprehensive range of counselling services for victims of the Bali bombings and their friends and relatives. The Commonwealth will cover any out-of-pocket costs for the treatment of injuries directly attributable to the bombings in Bali. The assistance will cover the difference between the Medicare rebate and the fee charged by the doctor for medical services, the full cost of pharmaceuticals under the PBS, including any copayments that normally would be payable, and the cost of allied health services that are certified by a doctor as necessary and related to the injury. The Commonwealth will be paying for economy air travel for the patient and accompanying family members to travel from hospital to their home town and will also meet the cost of road or rail transport. The Department of Health and Ageing, in collaboration with the Department of Family and Community Services and the state health authorities, has established a mechanism to manage this initiative.Finally, I inform the House that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, is today and tomorrow visiting hospitals in Darwin, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne to meet the victims of the bombings in Bali and their families and, importantly, to thank all those medical staff whose magnificent services have been a wonderful response to this sad occasion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. Enhancing ASIO's ability to obtain information which may prevent a terrorist attack in Australia is a vital element of the government's legislative response to the new security environment. Since the events of 11 September and 12 October have made this environment so terrifyingly real, we have consistently argued that we are not immune from terrorism. We need to give our security agencies the tough tools which will enable them to do all they can to protect the community from terrorist attack. Sadly, we now know at horrific cost that our region - and indeed Australia's shores - is not immune from the evils of terrorism. It is even clearer that we must do all we can to protect Australians and Australian interests.The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is currently before the Senate. If passed, it will help us to attack terrorism at its source. As ASIO has stated in its unclassified annual report and as I have repeatedly stated, there are groups within Australia which are sympathetic to terrorists and their interests. It is important in this environment that we strengthen ASIO's ability to gather intelligence about possible terrorist attacks which will assist to deter and prevent them. Senator Faulkner claimed in today's Australian that the ASIO bill goes further than corresponding legislation in other countries facing terrorist threats, such as the United Kingdom and United States. This is wrong. If a person has information relevant to the gathering of intelligence in relation to a terrorism offence or a possible terrorism offence, the community can legitimately expect that that person should provide the information to the authorities. Where they are unwilling to do so and a warrant as provided under the ASIO bill is required, the bill contains significantly more safeguards than laws in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Canada. The bill contains a detailed warrant procedure that must be followed before a person can be detained or questioned. The procedure requires the agreement of the federal Attorney-General, a federal judge, a federal magistrate or other authority.In Canada, a person may be detained for 24 hours before a warrant is sought. In the United Kingdom, a police constable may detain a person suspected of being a terrorist, without a warrant. In the United States, the Patriot Act 2001 provides that a person may be detained for up to seven days, if the Attorney General certifies that the person endangers national security. In addition, our bill contains a number of safeguards, including a role for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.As the House would be aware, the bill has already been through a very thorough process of committee examination. It has been closely examined by two parliamentary committees and significant amendments have been made in response to their recommendations. I repeat the offer to the opposition's leadership team to sit down and discuss their concerns so that we might move forward with this important tool against terrorism. I am disappointed that that offer has not been taken up. The government is and always has been mindful that we must not erode civil rights in the name of security. That is why the bill includes such extensive safeguards, more than apply in those countries which have already given their agencies similar powers.It is important to remember that terrorism is a direct and deadly assault on our human rights. We must ensure that we provide an environment where those entrusted with protecting our rights from terrorist assault have the tools which enable them to do so, and we must do so without delay. The government is taking steps to have the ASIO bill treated as an urgent bill in the Senate. It is up to the opposition to say whether they will support ASIO having the enhanced powers it needs.</DOC>

I will check to see whether there was any wider information provided to the authorities upon which we were advised to act and I will report back to the House.

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and the interest he has displayed during this period in keeping my office informed of the great difficulties that people are experiencing within his electorate and region. On Thursday night last week I was able to be present at Sydney airport to witness the unloading of two Erickson heavy-lift helicopters - frequently known as Elvis helicopters - from an Antanov air freighter. These Elvis helicopters are already in service in the Hunter Valley and the Blue Mountains, addressing the fires that are raging there. The delivery costs of these two aircraft exceeded the cost of sea freight by approximately $800,000. Further to its promise to state government agencies to meet half the cost of the sea freight and leasing of three of these helicopters at a cost of up to approximately $5.5 million, the Howard government has also committed to paying half the additional cost for the airfreight involved.The following information has been provided to me, and I am sure it will be of interest to the House. As things stand today, some 800 firefighters are working to contain 60 bushfires across New South Wales. I again record the thanks and the congratulations of our government and, I am sure, this House, to those firefighters who are out there doing that work in quite difficult circumstances. Furthermore, I would like to advise the House that I was in the electorate of Gilmore on Friday, where I was able to confirm and complete the arrangements for grants of $100,000 to the firefighting community there for pagers to replace the redundant ones they had and of $18,000 for an adequate catering facility so that the volunteers involved in that aspect of the work are able to support the courageous people when they are out fighting fires.Twenty fires are burning out of control throughout New South Wales today. There are 51 fires burning in New South Wales national parks. Twenty-two of these are categorised as bushfire emergencies - in other words, too large for local forces to deal with. Some 300 national park staff are attending to the fire situation across the state. Fortunately, as we speak, no property is under threat. As is known to the House, 13 families lost their homes in the weekend bushfires at Kitchener and Abernethy near Cessnock in the Hunter Valley. These fires are still posing the greatest concern to the firefighters. I must unfortunately add that 10 houses were also lost at Engadine a week or so ago. - I think worrying about pronunciations in a matter as serious as this is not really needed. I wish to add to that information with the tragic news that a 55-year-old man from Chatswood died when his car was engulfed in flames on Kearsley Road, Abernethy. Also, a Queensland bushfire which killed a woman last Thursday has been contained, as has a fire in a national park on Queensland's Granite Belt in the southern border region. In that case, it is estimated that 285 square kilometres of farm and bushland have been burnt around Stanhope, Eukey and Baradine. Media reports indicate that 234 people were evacuated. My department and I are continuing to monitor those circumstances and to address the issue of what other assistance might be available - remembering, of course, that firefighting and aspects of it are the constitutional responsibility of state governments, which do have all of the expertise and capacity necessary. The capacity of our government to respond in the way we did with that financial assistance arose from an initiative taken by this government at the beginning of this calendar year when we offered the Australian Fire Authorities Council, AFAC, $50,000 to address some form of unified response to the very expensive problems we have with aerial firefighting assets. We received that advice and were able to respond with our offer.The other issue of considerable concern is fire prevention. The report of the select committee of the New South Wales parliament into last year's bushfires gives us some quite alarming statistics. The information provided in that report points out that the manager of New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service had conducted only 19,000 hectares of hazard reduction in the previous 12 months; in fact, 0.37 per cent of the area under their responsibility. Subsequently, 750,000 hectares of the forests they control were destroyed in those fires. Conversely, State Forests of New South Wales, the other department responsible, had conducted 100,000 hectares, or 15.5 per cent, of hazard reduction in the forests under their responsibility and had a consistent history in that regard. They lost 2,000 hectares of forest - in other words, the difference between a disaster and something that would have hardly rated a mention.These are issues for the future. It is no good talking about them until we can put all the fires out. Our government not only will continue to provide all the assistance it can - the nature of which we have already identified - but also, in terms of those personally affected, in association with state governments, will continue to make available personal hardship and distress payments, concessional interest rate loans and grants, payments to replace essential public assets and payments for financial and psychological counselling where required.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He did advise my office before question time that he was going to ask the question. I have not yet received the letter, so I have not been able to read it. But let me just say, in a broad sense, that over the last two or three years my department has made a particular effort to try to improve the accessibility of travel advisories, and some of the statistics are illustrative of that. Obviously since the Bali tragedy things have changed dramatically, but prior to the Bali tragedy my department's web site was averaging 85,000 hits per week for travel advisories, and that was up from only 30,000 hits per week prior to 11 September 2001. So there has been a substantial improvement in the use, if you like, of the Internet access to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade web site and to the travel advisories on it.Nevertheless, the department has also been working over the last couple of years to ensure that the travel advisories are better disseminated to travel agents, airlines and the like. After 12 October, I did say to my department, `We still need to ask ourselves whether sufficient numbers of people read travel advisories,' and the honourable member is really getting to the heart of that point with his question and suggestions. Last week, I asked the department to give consideration to whether it is practical to expand the scope of the dissemination of travel advisories. There are a lot of different options you could consider there. I might mention, for the interest of the House, some of the options that could be implemented by the government, although we have made no decisions - and I will look at the honourable member's letter to see what he suggests in that and how practical those suggestions are as well.I will give four examples. The first is the placement of touch screen kiosks providing travel advice at airports and other locations frequented by prospective Australian travellers. It strikes me that when you go into the international terminal at an Australian airport - and you can rest assured that that is something I do fairly often - there is no sign of travel advisories. They are not there. So, on the face of it, as I said to the department, it would make a lot of sense for travel advisories to be made available in international terminals. Their suggestion that this could be done through touch screens is, I think, quite a good idea.The second idea being considered is convenience advertising, in which the department takes out advertising space in places like airport bathrooms and toilet facilities, travel sections of newspapers and so on. Thirdly, since passports are frequently obtained through post offices, consideration is being given to advertising in post offices. Fourthly, consideration is also being given to negotiating with post offices - or with another national network - to provide copies of travel advisories on request.This is a live issue for the government. It is something we need to consider. I will have a look at the ideas put forward by the honourable member, because it would be good if there were a simple, really effective way of getting travel advisories out to everyone. Travel agents get them, but they make the decision as to whether or not they show those travel advisories to people who go into travel agents to book their tickets. Nowadays a lot of people get electronic tickets, as do many of us in this House. You go to the check-in desk and you are just given a boarding pass after showing identification. You show your passport and answer a few questions about your luggage, but no travel advisory is provided in those circumstances. Is it practical to have them provided there? These are the sorts of issues we are having a look at.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for the question. Having visited his electorate recently, I know that he represents a very large proportion of the areas in New South Wales that are seriously affected by drought. Indeed, much of the grain belt and the pastoral areas of Australia are suffering from excessively low rainfall and clearly that is having a significant impact on farm incomes. The weather conditions over September were little better and some of the forecasts also give us little reason for optimism. ABARE will be making some revised, updated crop reports next week, but it is hard to believe that they will be any better than the gloomy prospects that have been reported in recent weeks.Last week the Wheat Board downgraded its forecast for the Australian wheat crop to the range of 11 million to 13 million tonnes. I think it is important to point out that, whilst the crop is obviously going to be poor, there will not be a shortage of grain in Australia. The Wheat Board already has carryover stocks in store from last year and with this season's harvest already commencing there will be adequate supplies of grain, but it could be very expensive. Those who need grain for feed are concerned about the high cost of the grain and naturally are looking towards imports. It is possible to import grain into Australia, but we are not prepared to compromise our pest and disease status, so imports also are likely to be expensive, and that adds to farm costs. ABARE has estimated that farm income will be down about $3.8 billion this year and that has a flow-on effect to country towns and indeed to the whole of the national economy.The member particularly asked about assistance that is available to farm families in crisis. The Farm Help program is an ongoing program available to farmers facing financial difficulty. There are well over 1,000 farmers now in Australia who are receiving welfare assistance through that program and, if they make a decision during the time they are receiving that assistance that they need to leave agriculture, they can receive a $45,000 exit payment to make their movement out of agriculture a little less painful. The government has recently recommitted to the Rural Financial Counselling Service. There are 63 community based counsellors available to provide assistance to people who need some help in this time to make decisions about their future. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme is helping a lot of farmers through this dry spell to be able to manage their own way through the difficulties. There is currently over $2 billion in the Farm Management Deposit Scheme and at least $1 billion of that is available to farmers who have provided investments over the years to help them through these difficult times. There have been substantial tax benefits available to make this scheme so worth while and it is undoubtedly going to be of enormous assistance to rural Australia in getting through these difficult times. But there are some places where even for the most prudent managers, those putting aside in the good times for the bad, the circumstances are such that it is beyond their capacity to cope, and the exceptional circumstances arrangements are designed to help those cases. There are three areas in Australia that received exceptional circumstances declarations last year: the grain belt in Western Australia, the Darling Downs in Queensland and the Central Highlands areas of Tasmania. Farmers in those areas are still receiving welfare and interest rate assistance as a result of the declarations. In the Burke and Brewarrina area, as a result of the government's decision to bring forward the consideration of applications where possible through the use of predicting modelling, welfare assistance is now available to successful applicants. There are also reports that a number of other applications will be coming forward from New South Wales and also from the Queensland government for the Peak Downs and Capella region. Naturally, when those applications come forward they will be given careful consideration. The NRAC have already visited the Burke and Brewarrina area and are preparing a report to the government on whether it should be declared, and they have also made a preliminary visit to Queensland.The government stand ready to provide assistance wherever we can to farmers who are facing difficulties. The states also have in place some assistance measures, and they are appreciated. Of course, there is the Farmhand Foundation now which is providing an opportunity for people in the community to make financial contributions towards the needs of drought-stricken primary producers, and also will help provide some planning to deal with droughts in the future. I commend those appeals and that support mechanism to those farmers who are facing the real difficulties associated with drought, and assure them of the government's concern for their situation and its willingness to help wherever possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. As he indicated in his question, at the July meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Council it was agreed by the respective Commonwealth, state and territory ministers that a working party would be formed to produce a coordinated response plan for Australia in the event of a major incident that overwhelms the resources of burns management services. Indeed, the carriage for the establishment and the ongoing work of this working group was given to Western Australia and to the Department of Health in that state. I am informed that this work, under the carriage of Western Australia, is currently in its preliminary stages. I can indicate to the honourable member and to the House generally that, if the matter is not raised again at the next meeting of the Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers in terms of the items on the agenda, the Commonwealth will ensure that it is on the agenda.While I believe that all members would hope and pray that we would never require such extensive medical services again, particularly those involving the burns units, we will naturally use the response right around Australia to this tragedy to ensure that services are in a state of appropriate readiness in the future, and to learn from this. I emphasise again, as I did in answer to an earlier question, that I think all members and senators acknowledge the magnificent work which has been undertaken, particularly by the burns units in the various hospitals right throughout Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can advise the House that Moody's rating agency today upgraded Australia to a AAA credit rating on Australia's foreign currency debt and deposits. The Commonwealth credit rating was downgraded by Moody's on two occasions: once in 1986 to AA1 and a second time in 1989 to AA2. The upgrading to a AAA credit rating today upgraded Australia's rating by two positions to the AAA mark. Standard and Poor's credit rating also downgraded Australia twice: once in 1986 to AA+ and once in 1989 to AA. It upgraded Australia back to AA+ in 1999, but Australia is still not at the top rating by Standard and Poor's.We welcome the fact that Moody's has upgraded Australia today to a AAA credit rating. This not only affects the Commonwealth but increases the rating ceiling that can be applied to other domestic residents, including state governments and private sector companies - that is, state governments and private sector companies cannot go higher than the Commonwealth rating. Now that the Commonwealth has been re-rated up, the states and private companies can be accordingly. Moody's today, as a consequence of this upgrading, also upgraded the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia, the AIDC, EFIC, the New South Wales Treasury Corporation, the Queensland Treasury Corporation, the Western Australian Treasury Corporation and the Treasury Corporation of Victoria.Upgrading Australia to a AAA credit rating was the result of a reassessment and, in part, a methodology change adopted by Moody's. It indicates that Australia is now at the very top of Moody's credit rating, bringing us into line with the advanced OECD country grouping, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Today, New Zealand and Iceland were also upgraded. The consequence of that is that those states and companies which have followed the Commonwealth up with a higher credit rating will be able to borrow at a lower risk premium, and their financial position accordingly will be strengthened. For those governments that are borrowing, being able to borrow at lower interest rates means that taxpayers will get better value. Australia returns to the top credit rating that Moody's allows in relation to bonds and deposits on foreign currency - the AAA credit rating.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I certainly recall touring the area, and I did so with the extraordinarily active member for the region - who at that stage was Joanna Gash - who was at that stage herself a volunteer firefighter, which I think reflected very well on her. I will check the media reportage and transcripts of anything I actually said, but my quite clear recollection was -  - It is an important matter. I do not run away from that at all. The commitment I gave was to the effect that we would cooperate in seeking to draw together in areas where there might be seen to be an inadequate capacity to respond properly, nationally, in a coordinated and consistent way, to fire emergencies. I do not think I set out any prescriptions as to how that ought to be taken forward. I indicated that we would make available some resources and our full cooperation to seek a properly funded and coordinated way forward across the nation. To the best of my knowledge, that has been undertaken in no small way, fully adequately, by the minister for territories. I will check the wording but, again, I do not think I made any commitment to a summit. I think it is an interesting reflection on the Labor Party that they believe you cannot seek any way forward without a summit.</DOC>

 - If  the shadow minister had been listening, he would be aware that that strategy is well advanced. If he were also acquainted with the functions of firefighting in Australia, he would know that state governments and their relative agencies have the expertise and the normal responsibility in this regard. Consequently, a national approach was implemented by the Deputy Prime Minister writing to a group called AFAC - which, I am sure, the shadow minister would know is the Australian Fire Authorities Council - because they happen to know a bit about fighting fires. -  - You want to learn a bit about that; you've got a few. The Deputy Prime Minister wrote to that group, with covering letters, as I understand, to the appropriate ministers, because they are fully informed. That body was given $50,000 for the purpose of producing a strategy but, more importantly, on the better use of aerial firefighting assets. It is not uncommon around the world in places like Canada, with a similar geographic spread to Australia, to have an arrangement whereby the provinces, as they are known in Canada, have ownership of assets for fighting fires and those assets are coordinated so that they can all be where the fire happens to be.About two months ago a report was given to me by that authority. It was in two parts. One was a list of the assets they needed for aerial firefighting, with a request that the Commonwealth government pay for virtually all of them, and advice that for another $200,000 they could go forward with a more detailed strategy. One would hope that that would include the standardisation of pipe fittings between New South Wales and Victoria so that when there is a crossover of volunteer firefighters they can actually connect to the tap. But that work is yet to be done. The Australian Fire Authorities Council -  presumably at the direction of their ministers; no secrets have been kept from them - have failed to go on with the detailed work. The reality is that the Commonwealth government have taken the initiative as promised. It is an initiative to which I referred. We still await the advice of the experts. We are unable to be the expert in an area where we do not have a department fully committed. It is a state responsibility. Our initiative was to bring it together. I remind the House that in response to that request for some $20-plus million - nearly $28 million - the government immediately offered to address the difficulty associated with bringing in the very heavy helicopters from overseas. This was a financial commitment that had to be made on the spot. Funds had to be provided up front. Most of the other assets, if not all of them, are available in Australia. Some, like crop-dusters, are typically not in operation in their traditional work at that time of the year. There was no real reason for the Commonwealth to make offers in that regard. What is more, when we started having fires in October, we immediately offered to put up half of the air freight to get those helicopters here. They are out there saving lives at the moment. If that is not a national strategy, Mr Prime Minister, I would like the shadow minister to tell me what is. </DOC>

 - The precise answer, speaking for myself personally, is that I have not had any discussions. If the honourable gentleman believes there could be a difficulty, then I will immediately look into it. I hesitate to say more, because it may well have been at a departmental level that something has been done. I personally have not had discussions, but I will make every inquiry and, if in fact there is going to be a difficulty, we will see what alternative arrangements we can make.</DOC>

 - The community, naturally enough, in the wake of the very tragic incident in Melbourne yesterday at Monash University, again has in its mind the dangers that exist from the proliferation of hand guns in this country. The House will be aware of the greatly strengthened gun laws that came out of the Port Arthur tragedy in 1996. There is already independent evidence that the buy-back that followed the combined action of Commonwealth and state governments at that time - which had very strong bipartisan support, let me acknowledge in this parliament - withdrew many hundreds of thousands of guns from the community and that that has been successful in reducing the murder rate in Australia, or certainly the murder rate involving guns.When I have the opportunity on Thursday after the memorial service to meet the premiers and chief ministers to sign the intergovernmental agreement on counter-terrorism, I intend to also at that time raise with them the issue of further strengthening of gun laws through whatever additional steps need to be taken by both the Commonwealth and the state governments. The only way we can get a sensible strengthening of gun laws in this country is for all of the governments to work together and not for people to start blaming one or other jurisdiction. I am not blaming the states, and there is no case for the states blaming the Commonwealth. The police ministers already have this issue on their agenda, and I understand it is going to be discussed at a meeting of police ministers - what, on 7 or 8 November? - In two weeks time. That is probably pretty close to 7 November. It is going to be discussed there. I just wanted to make the point that, while the premiers and I will not be able to have a detailed discussion, as we are meeting on Thursday, albeit briefly, to sign the intergovernmental agreement, I intend to raise this matter with them - not in a spirit of criticism but in a spirit of seeing whether there are additional things we can do in order to take more weapons out of society. I have a very strong view that, consistent with protecting the rights of sporting shooters in a legitimate sense, I am still alarmed at the large number of automatic hand guns there are circulating in the Australian community - I really am. There are obviously further changes that can be made at both state and federal levels that can strengthen gun laws.I ought to inform the House that recently there has been quite a dramatic increased Customs intervention at our borders. We now have 100 per cent of postal items either X-rayed or inspected; indeed, every single parcel coming into Australia through Australia Post large enough to carry a gun or a gun part is now X-rayed. In addition, 100 per cent of passengers coming into Australia through our airports have their luggage X-rayed; 70 per cent of all air cargo consignments entering Australia are X-rayed; and inspection rates at sea ports have been and will continue to be increased through the use of trace-particle detectors - that is, ion scan equipment - X-ray equipment capable of examining pallet sized cargo and mobile X-ray machines. By November of this year, the first state-of-the-art container X-ray facility is scheduled to be fully operational in Melbourne, which will allow Customs to inspect up to 100 complete containers a day. Further facilities in Brisbane, Sydney and Fremantle will come on line later this year and into 2003.It is always possible for governments plural to do more in this area and, as I say, I will be approaching the discussion on Thursday not in a spirit of finger pointing but in a spirit of seeing whether the state and federal governments can cooperate further to try and achieve together an even tougher regime in relation to automatic hand guns. We have seen what can be achieved when we work together in relation to long arms - that has been a very successful policy. Now we will see what we can do if we can work together in relation to automatic hand guns.</DOC>

 - The APEC leaders meeting is always an important occasion for this country because it brings together nations that we relate to economically, politically and strategically in the Asia-Pacific region. This year's meeting will have added relevance because of the tragic events in Bali. It will be an opportunity for me to again speak to the Indonesian President to discuss, in more detail and face to face, the progress of the joint operation being conducted to try and find who is responsible for the outrage in Bali. It will be an opportunity collectively for the APEC leaders to reaffirm their very strong opposition to terrorism and to see whether there are other measures that cooperatively we can embrace in order to further strengthen the fight against terrorism.It is sadly the case that, just as the last APEC leaders meeting in Shanghai took place in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, so it is that this APEC meeting in Mexico will take place in the wake of the terrorist outrage that has claimed so many Australian lives on 12 October. Terrorism not only has an enormous human cost but it also has a potentially devastating effect on economic activity and economic confidence. The impact of this attack on the economy of Bali in particular, and of Indonesia more generally, is readily apparent, I am sure, to everybody in this House.Beyond that, the APEC meeting will be an opportunity to reaffirm the Bogor goals. I will certainly be going there with the intention of reaffirming the Australian government's very strong commitment to those goals and to the goals of a more open and therefore more profitable world trading system. Prosperity is important for regional stability. The provision of greater economic growth and more jobs will provide greater internal resistance to the blandishments of terrorism, and it will provide less fertile ground in which terrorism may flourish. It is important that we continue to work towards removing the barriers to trade and to help stimulate world economic growth.I hope that APEC will send a very strong message of support for the current World Trade Organisation round, which offers major gains for both developed and developing countries. The World Bank estimates that export earnings of the world's poorest countries are depressed by at least 10 per cent because those countries are shut out of the world's great agricultural markets - namely, the United States, the European Union and Japan. It has to be said again that, if the developed world were to dismantle protective trade barriers, that would do infinitely more for the future growth and prosperity of developing countries than multiples of the official development aid that wealthy countries now provide. I have to say again to the European Union, to the United States and to Japan - countries and, in the case of the European Union, areas that talk frequently and understandably about overseas aid; and the contribution they make to that is to be praised - `You could do a lot more for the countries you send overseas aid to, if you got rid of those trade barriers.'The history of the developing world in the last few years is a stark comparison between those countries that have been able to access globalisation and those that have not. It is very hard for a poor, impoverished country to access globalisation when it cannot export its product into the biggest markets in the world. That is the problem. It is a bigger problem than the relative paucity of overseas development aid. It is one of the reasons why we continue to criticise the trading policies of the European Union. It is why I express concern about the trading policies, in agriculture in particular, of the United States and also of Japan. This will be an opportunity for me to rearticulate those views, particularly in relation to the APEC members that fall into that category. I hope that, out of APEC, we can get a reaffirmation of the importance of more open trading systems for the future growth prospects of developing countries.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Werriwa, I inform the House that I have not seen those remarks from the Victorian police officer. I will have a look at them afterwards. I again draw the member for Werriwa's attention to the answer I gave in relation to the measures we have taken recently. They involve the situation now where 100 per cent of postal items are either X-rayed or inspected - 100 per cent! - Indeed every single parcel coming into Australia through Australia Post large enough to carry a gun or a gun part is X-rayed. One hundred per cent of passengers coming into Australia through our airports have their luggage X-rayed and 70 per cent of all air cargo consignments entering Australia are X-rayed. The member for Werriwa raises the issue of a coastguard. This was raised in the last election campaign. We examined the proposal very carefully, again. The answer is: I do not believe the introduction of a coastguard, as outlined by the Labor Party, will do anything to achieve the outcome that he has argued. All a coastguard, as proposed by the Labor Party, will do is weaken the capacity and the resources of the Royal Australian Navy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I informed the House last week of the establishment by the Australian Red Cross of an Australia-wide appeal to help the victims of the Bali bombing. On Sunday night the Seven Network conducted a telethon, which raised around $2.5 million in support of the victims of the Bali bombings. Australians have responded very generously to this appeal. So far, including the amounts which have been donated by the Commonwealth and other governments, the total donated to the Red Cross Bali appeal stands at $9 million. This is a great achievement by all Australians showing practical concern and care for their fellow Australians, particularly for victims who are injured and for their families. The donations to the appeal can be used in two ways: to assist those victims and their families or to assist the Red Cross to continue to provide relief in Bali to cover future needs, including recovery and reconstruction.The foreign minister has already announced humanitarian assistance of $300,000 in the form of cash grants to the Indonesian Red Cross for related medical services. In addition to that, the Prime Minister has announced a comprehensive package of assistance to the victims. The government will pay the return to Australia of the remains of Australians killed. The government will provide financial assistance to Australian families and friends of victims who have incurred additional costs by staying on in Bali, including up to seven days accommodation. Family members who have travelled to Bali to seek out relatives will have the cost of their air fares and accommodation for up to seven days met by the government. Details of the various forms of assistance available can be obtained from Centrelink, on its web site or on an inquiry number - 136 125. The donations to the Red Cross Bali bombings appeal are tax deductible where the donation is $2 or more. I encourage those Australians who are able to support that appeal, and I thank those Australians who have assisted generously and magnificently for the response to date.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I explained to the House yesterday, last week I instructed my department to examine ways where we could improve dissemination of the travel advisories. They have not completed that investigation, but the examples given by the honourable member, frankly, confirm my own anecdotal evidence that, although travel advisories are believed to be sent to travel agents, I am pretty sure that travel agents typically would not show the travel advisories to people as they purchase tickets. It raises the question of whether it would even be feasible to make it mandatory for travel agents to give travel advisories to people. That is obviously something we are having a look at, but, to the extent that we might legislate to do so, that is, of course, a very large step forward.We need to carefully examine all the options available, bearing in mind that many people do not use travel agents. I am sure the Minister for Small Business and Tourism would be able to tell us what percentage of people use travel agents when they travel abroad. Clearly, whatever the answer to that question, it is not 100 per cent. As I said yesterday, one of the ideas that, on the face of it, appeals to me - although more work needs to be done on this - is to make travel advisories available either electronically or in paper form at international terminals. Some people say that the trouble with that is that by the time people get into the terminal ipso facto they have bought their ticket and are on their way; they are hardly likely to turn back. While I accept that point, the fact that they have with them the information and they understand the risks should ensure that there is a heightened degree of security taken by those people.The honourable member's question does draw attention, quite rightly in my view, to weaknesses in dissemination of travel advisories and, as I said, it is important that we get it right. Since 12 October, obviously, travel advisories are getting an enormous amount of publicity as we change them. Never have travel advisories, except in the period immediately after 11 September 2001, got as much publicity. Inevitably, as time goes on, that level of publicity will decline. In those circumstances, we need to make sure that these are appropriately drawn to the attention of travellers, and much better than is the case at the moment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I think all of us in this House would agree that the terrorist threat is the greatest challenge that we face as a nation. It is international in scope and is indiscriminate in its application towards victims. We are targets of terrorism for what we stand for, as are other Western countries. Our values and freedoms, nevertheless, are non-negotiable and we will defend them with unrelenting vigour. But the struggle against terrorism cannot be conducted in the way a traditional conflict is fought. Terrorism's global reach - its transnational nature - requires that we work with our regional partners and our allies in a closely coordinated and cooperative way. The government is pursuing this and pursuing the challenge of meeting the terrorist threat at a number of levels and in a number of ways. First of all, it is clearly important that work continues to place restrictions on the financing of terrorist activities. There are United Nations resolutions and conventions, and there have been a range of different initiatives to try to ensure that individual countries take decisive action against the financing of terrorism. With Indonesia, the Australian government will be co-hosting a regional conference to combat terrorism financing and money laundering in Indonesia in December. That conference will be jointly opened by Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda and by me on behalf of Australia. The second thing I would mention is that to fight terrorism it is very important to enhance the cooperation between intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies in our respective countries. We have traditional relationships with a number of intelligence agencies, but in recent times the government has been promoting and getting signed memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism which provide for cooperation between intelligence agencies, with Indonesia, as is well known, and also more recently with Malaysia and Thailand. We are also talking to the Philippines about concluding a similar memorandum of understanding, and the Philippines experience of terrorism is well known to all in this House.Thirdly, we have to keep working with our regional partners and with other countries to develop domestic legislative frameworks to counter terrorism. This was a particular focus of a regional technical workshop we co-hosted for Pacific island countries in Honolulu in March this year - some time ago. I make the point that to deal with the problem of terrorism each country has to have effective laws which protect civil liberties and human rights and, at the same time, effective laws that are able to deal with the crime of terrorism and the operation of terrorist organisations. The fourth point I would make is that there need to be effective border controls in order to regulate the flow of people into and out of countries. That was a feature of a regional workshop we co-hosted in Bangkok in April this year for ASEAN Regional Forum countries.Earlier in question time, the Prime Minister talked about APEC. As is clear, it is very important that the upcoming APEC meeting in Los Cabos is effective in building on APEC's already existing initiatives to deal with the problem of terrorism. The government also thinks that terrorist organisations need to be effectively targeted through the United Nations system. The Prime Minister said last week that Australia would be promoting the listing with the United Nations of Jemaah Islamiah as a terrorist organisation, drawing attention to the fact that Jemaah Islamiah, a South-East Asian terrorist organisation, has direct links with al-Qaeda. Since the Prime Minister spoke of this, we have had extensive discussions with our regional partners and other countries about this. Our expectation is that we will be co-sponsoring with a number of other countries the listing of Jemaah Islamiah in the United Nations over the next few days.Finally, it is well known that the close cooperation between Australia and the United States is fundamentally important to our capacity to continue effectively the fight against terrorism. The alliance with the United States is crucial to the efficacy of our efforts in the fight against terrorism and is deeply beneficial to the overall international effort to fight terrorism. Next week Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence, and I will both be in Washington for the annual Australia-US ministerial talks - what are known as AUSMIN. We will meet with Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld. Clearly, a very substantial component of our discussions with the Americans next week is to look at what more we can do to counter the terrorist threat in South-East Asia and through other parts of the world. Terrorism is not just a regional problem, not just a problem for the Middle East and not just a problem for South-East Asia. This is a global problem and it requires a global response. Our cooperation with our allies such as the United States and working with other countries in the region are going to be central to our capacity to deal with this. Let me just acknowledge the presence in the House of members of a British parliamentary committee on intelligence who are visiting Australia. I take the opportunity of saying how we very much appreciate the close intelligence cooperation with the British government in the fight against terrorism.</DOC>

 - As I have told the House on a number of occasions, the government believes that the expensing of share options should follow the release of the IASB standard, which we expect to be adopted by Australia as soon as it is issued. If there is under that standard a legitimate expense, then it would give rise to a deduction. If there were not a legitimate expense as against the company, then there would not be a deduction. The position of the government is that it will consider carefully the tax treatment in the light of the application of the standard in accordance with those principles. It will announce its position once that standard has been issued.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that he has shown an enormous interest in the Campbelltown and Camden sustainable regions area. He has almost worn out the carpet in my office coming in highlighting the need for good programs to be supported against the backdrop of a really sustainable vision for a stronger future, particularly for employment. He cares about jobs in his area.There are eight prototype regions: the Atherton Tablelands; Campbelltown and Camden, as I have just touched on; the far north-east of New South Wales; the Gippsland in Victoria; the Kimberly in Western Australia, right up in the north-west; the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, a particularly hard-hit area; the Playford-Salisbury area in South Australia; and the Wide Bay Burnett in Queensland. Funding has been provided to each of these regions to assist identifying further strategic opportunities for building a stronger investment and employment base and, in particular, stronger futures for young people in those regions -  all of which have been assessed as, if you like, not sharing in the nation's improved prosperity and better economic outlooks.These programs are community driven and community owned. Local advisory committees have been involved in the process of setting strategic options and they have identified job creation, education and training at all levels, community development and value adding, both existing and to new proposed businesses, as being very important in each of their areas. I am meeting with the chairs and the executive officers of the advisory committees at dinner tonight and tomorrow morning. They are here for a two-day strategic planning meeting hosted by my department. Certainly there are quite a significant number of projects now coming forward. For example, in the Atherton Tablelands, a hard-hit area in North Queensland, we are seeing concrete proposals for the development of agriculture, industry and tourism and the building on existing infrastructure and such industries as a sustainable sweet corn industry and the opportunity to participate in untapped timber export markets in Asia. In Tasmania, we are now seeing an investment plan being brought forward for the north-west and west coast of Tasmania. The community down there, recognising nominal funding over four years of up to $12 million from the Commonwealth, has set itself the objective of multiplying that threefold in attracting new investment in jobs in that region. The Tasmanian Advocate editorialised yesterday that the launch of the process comes at the perfect time. The article goes on to say that, despite the very real difficulties the area has faced:There is a positive feel about the region at present, but the gains being felt need to be supported and enhanced, and this program provides the perfect opportunity for that to be achieved.I think the coming months will see significant benefits flowing from the government's approach in assisting regions to lead their own development as more projects are rolled out in each region. Our objective is clear: it is to ensure that Australians living in areas that have experienced real adjustment shock, and where both investment indicators and employment indicators reflect disadvantage, are able to enjoy and take part in the increased prosperity that has unquestionably been a feature of the national economic outlook under the management of this government.</DOC>

 - As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, and as I understood it, it was the Labor Party's point of view that executive share options to be expensed in company accounts require an accounting standard which sets out the methodology. As I understood it, the Australian Labor Party, like the government, believed that the expensing of share options should be done and that therefore the accounting standard under which it is to be done should be promulgated to enable those companies to comply with it. The accounting standard is being considered by the International Accounting Standards Board. We have a state-of-the-art corporate governance model in this country which allows the automatic adoption of IASB standards, subject only to disallowance - that is, the AASB can adopt an IASB standard and it becomes law, subject to disallowance.The point I made earlier was that, if that IASB requires it to be treated as an expense, the argument will be that the company, having incurred an expense under normal taxation law which allows a deduction for expenses, should be entitled to a deduction. That will be the argument. What we have said is that we will not give a ruling in advance of that accounting standard because we do not know the form which the accounting standard will take. It may well be that the ordinary law will cut in. It may well be that it will be argued that the ordinary law does not apply to the standard as it is promulgated. What I said in answer to the last question was that the government's position - an eminently reasonable position, and I can think of no other - is that, once the standard has been made, once the expensing methodology is set out, once you determine whether or not it is a bona fide expense, if the question then arises as to the tax treatment of that, the government will consider it. I would have thought that an eminently reasonable position, and no other position could be entered into in advance of the issue of that particular standard.</DOC>

 - Firstly, on indulgence, as the federal minister for education and on behalf of the Australian education community, I express our condolences to the families of the two students who were killed at Monash University yesterday and the families of those students who were injured. I also express our admiration for those who stopped this from being a greater disaster than it was and our congratulations to the staff for the way in which they handled this incident.I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and also for his chairmanship of the House of Representatives inquiry into the education of boys. He was strongly supported in that regard by the member for Port Adelaide and the members of the committee who served across two parliaments. There are four key themes that need to be examined in relation to the education of our boys. Firstly, there are biological differences which are obvious between boys and girls, but boys learn in different ways from girls. Secondly, there are also gender biases locked into the education system. We have lived through more than a generation where there have been biases built into the education system in favour of girls - which has been appropriate. We need to examine teaching and curriculum for boys and also take into account the socioeconomic circumstances of students - and boys in particular. In fact, Dr Tim Hawkes during this inquiry made the observation that, whereas once it was considered to be a virtue, parents these days look upon the masculinity of their boys and wonder whether it is not an obstacle to be overcome.In thinking about the education of boys, there are some key issues that need to be considered by our government and indeed all governments. Boys are achieving at significantly lower levels than girls in all areas of the assessed cognitive curriculum throughout primary and secondary school. One-half of referrals to consultant paediatricians are for behavioural problems - almost all of them boys - and 20 per cent for learning problems. The Australian Council for Educational Research found in 1975 that 30 per cent of 14-year-old boys could not pass a basic literacy test; by 1995, that had increased to 35 per cent. The difference between the tertiary entrance score for boys and that for girls increased from 0.6 per cent to almost 19 per cent from 1981 to 1996 in New South Wales. Girls are exceeding boys in the higher school certificate results, or year 12 results, across the country in around 90 per cent of courses.Perhaps more disturbingly, boys are represented more than two to one in the bottom 20 per cent of school achievers. In terms of literacy benchmarks for which we are now measuring the performance of boys and girls throughout Australia - thanks largely to the efforts of the member for Goldstein - we know that boys are achieving at around 4½ percentage points behind that of girls. Further to that, in the state of Tasmania almost one in four boys cannot pass a basic year 5 reading test, and in the state of Queensland one in five boys cannot pass a basic year 5 reading test. We also know that 80 per cent of boys comprise the suspension and expulsion rates for students at school and that boys in many coeducational schools represent 100 per cent of school disciplinary programs. To complete the scenario, boys are disproportionately represented in terms of assault, drug use, spinal cord injury; they are three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident; and our sons are six times more likely to take their own lives - obviously through suicide.This report makes a significant contribution to the Commonwealth's understanding of the education of boys as we go forward. We are already committing $1.4 billion over four years for strategic initiatives to support students who are falling behind, including boys, and $734 million was invested specifically into literacy and numeracy. Also this year, the government announced $82 million over three years to support teacher professional development and leadership - initiatives which will support teaching in literacy, numeracy, maths, science, vocational education and training.I would also like to announce that late next month I will be convening a forum to which I have invited the key contributors to the education of boys throughout this country, including Professor Michael Carr-Greg, Dr Richard Fletcher, Professor Ken Rowe and a range of those who are deeply concerned about the future of boys in this country and their education. I will also be inviting the member for Macquarie and the member for Port Adelaide, both of whom I know will make a significant contribution to this conference.The point needs to be made that, despite the derision and ridicule of the Australian Labor Party, if we produce a generation of boys who are disengaged, who are disillusioned and ill prepared for life, we will be doing a great disservice not only to them and their economic and personal development but to subsequent generations of all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I cannot confirm that any such directive has been given. However, the government has shown that it is prepared to make very substantial contributions to the environment from its consolidated revenue. It has put into place major programs to address the issues of salinity and water quality in this country and has allocated an additional $1 billion from consolidated revenue to the Natural Heritage Trust. I believe that those two major programs show that this government is committed, as no previous government has been, to ensure that the Australian environment and the continent are put on a sustainable basis.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. I was recently in her electorate and was very impressed with Delatite Shire Council. It was through her lobbying efforts that they were able to secure $130,000 for an innovative, collaborative youth service and pilot project, which is directly related to trying to help young people in the area of education and training. The coalition government has a very sound record on increasing the education, abilities and the standard of living for young people no matter where they live but particularly for those in remote and regional parts of Australia.Indeed, I must compliment the Treasurer in regard to yesterday's AAA rating of Australia's economic performance. It demonstrates that there is a sound economic underpinning, no matter where you live in Australia, ensuring strong economic growth, strong employment, low interest rates and greater job opportunities. This is especially so through the areas of the family tax benefit and the child-care benefit which have advantaged many Australians.When it comes to rural and regional areas, I was happy to recently announce some programs for young people at risk. In the area of risk, $950,000 recently went to a reconnect program. That is again to tackle youth homelessness. In the member for Lingiari's electorate $800,000 went recently to a service to help the homeless. Another example was in the electorate of the member for Cowper, who is doing a terrific job there. Again, $170,000 went to employment, education and training programs there. In the member for O'Connor's electorate there was also the recent amount of $450,000 for employment, education and training services.But when it comes to improving the tyranny of distance and when it comes to educational opportunities for young Australians, the one area where there has been improvement is certainly in youth allowance. Since the introduction of youth allowance, there are more people than ever before undertaking either part-time study or full-time study, particularly from regional parts of Australia. Indeed, what we introduced with rent assistance gave many people - no matter where they live in Australia, but particularly in rural areas - the opportunity to go away to further study. Fare allowance, remote area allowance and the higher living away from home rate for youth allowance have made study far more possible. Indeed, the changes that we made when it came to the assets test for those from farms or from rural businesses where we are up to a 75 per cent threshold, have meant that many people from rural Australia, where their parents may be asset rich and income poor - and that is the case now with the drought that is affecting so many communities - have the ability to go away to further study.I would also like to compliment the Deputy Prime Minister, who recently launched a booklet which I thought was important - the Commonwealth information booklet. We are again providing greater resources to young people where they can access it. I thank the minister for agriculture as well, who is behind me over here and who is providing a number of rural scholarships and the Young Australian Rural Network. I also thank the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who has been terrific in following on from his predecessor when it comes to the increased level of apprenticeships and traineeships and also to vocational education and training. I also mention the Minister for Science and many members on this side of parliament deserve thanks.But I think it would be remiss of me not to mention, as this is Carers Week - and I think the opposition should respond to this as well - the fact that we have over 390,000 carers under the age of 26 looking after someone, 19,000 of whom are principal carers. There are many young carers. We have actually 2,900 under the age of 15 and many of those are in rural and remote communities.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I said it when he asked it yesterday and I was intending to add to it at the conclusion of question time today: I have checked the media reportage and transcripts and everything that we have been able to find in my office - and we are not without resources - to see what I said at the time. I have done that. The only direct transcript was from AAP, which quoted me directly as saying:We're prepared to co-ordinate a national overviewing of the best way to handle the matter of aerial firefighting. If that's a useful way forward for the states without crossing the boundaries of responsibilities, we're prepared to help in that way if it can produce better outcomes.It is true that at least one media report interpreted that as me calling for a summit but those are the actual words that I said.We delivered on that. We have sought to cooperate with the states. I have to say that I made no reference to a summit. I can find no reference to my having referred to calling a summit. I am not quite certain that this is a terribly profound matter to be pursuing in this place. We have plainly recognised the importance of fighting fires. We have plainly been prepared to cooperate. I announced at that time that we would help with the importation of a couple of these giant helitankers. The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government has worked through this matter. The government has considered its response. We are helping out with heavy lift helicopters this year.I have to say to you that the most important thing that anyone in the ALP could do when it comes to managing fire risk in New South Wales would be to talk to the government of that state about how it manages fuel loads, given the massive increase in national parks that it has presided over without a commensurate increase in the staffing and resources required to look after them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. In his electorate on the Gold Coast, he has a large number of small businesses - particularly those involved in tourism have been handling recent events very well.The government are helping small business get on with their business. As the House is well aware, we have reduced company tax to 30 per cent, abolished financial institutions duty, reduced excise taxes, reduced personal income tax, abolished provisional tax and halved capital gains tax. That all helps to support Australia's 1.2 million small businesses. It also encourages them to employ more Australians. - I note the interjection about the GST. I remind the House that, in the 12 months after the introduction of the GST, 44,000 new small businesses were started up. It has helped business get on with the business of making money.In 1997, in response to the views of small business, the Australian government set up the Business Entry Point. This is a one-stop shop web site for Australia's businesses to be able to access information and services provided by all governments - local, state and federal. Business want to have a means of cutting through red tape. They do not care whether it is federal government, state government or local government; they want answers and they want results. This web site has been very successful. It receives 160,000 visits per month, it has over one million look-ups per month and it is the fifth most popular national government site in the country. Business can access over 2,000 transactions at a local, state and federal level.I spoke with a large number of small businesses around Australia, and they gave me some feedback that the site should be improved to be made more friendly, particularly to a range of small businesses. I asked the public servants involved with the Business Entry Point to go out and consult with some of these businesses and ask them what they wanted. I gave them some particular names; one name was Joe and Sam Antico's fruit shop in Northbridge. I suggested to the public servants that, if people like Joe and Sam Antico were satisfied with the useability of the site, then the site would be a whole lot more accessible and easier to use for a whole lot of different small businesses.I am pleased to inform the House that next week we will be launching the new Business Entry Point at Joe and Sam Antico's fruit shop in Northbridge. The new site is faster to use, is quicker to download - particularly for regional and remote users - allows businesses to discover and carry out transactions with all levels of government in an improved way and, most importantly, is about helping particularly small businesses to cut through the red tape. The web site, at business.gov.au, should be more accessible and easier to use and will help to reduce some of the administrative burden facing small business.</DOC>

 - I am happy to provide some up-to-date information to the honourable member in relation to the number of applications and recipients of benefits to date. As the government announced at the time that we indicated we were speeding up the arrangements associated with the payment of welfare benefits, those payments will be processed once applications are received and backdated to the date of the announcement. That is common practice. We normally make that kind of arrangement, and then the payments are backdated from the time of acceptance to the date of announcement.My understanding is that, as of this morning, 113 application forms have been distributed by Centrelink's call centre - 83 direct to farmers and 30 to rural financial counsellors for distribution. The New South Wales Rural Adjustment Authority has processed 47 requests for the certificate that is required in relation to residential eligibility, 38 of which were successful. Six claims have been received by Centrelink, and three of those have been approved. I understand payments will be made tomorrow for all of those, backdated to 19 September. The applications are being considered as they are being received.Centrelink is calling each of the people, and has been for some time now, who have received the certificate from the New South Wales Rural Adjustment Authority to check whether they need some assistance with completion of the forms. Some of the applicants have indicated they are awaiting rural financial counsellors' assistance to achieve that objective. The payment of benefits is flowing, as indicated by the government, and we would expect that more applications will be processed promptly. - I am reminded by the interjection of the member behind me that that compares with the situation in New South Wales, where, once an area is declared by the New South Wales government, everyone has to wait six months before they are even eligible to apply for any assistance. There is a degree of hypocrisy in the criticism coming from members opposite.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Page has drawn attention to a way in which farmers are able to help themselves through difficult times. For years farmers have been calling for tax based assistance to help them to drought-proof their properties or to prepare for circumstances where they need special assistance to see them through. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme has been an excellent example of such a scheme actually working. As I reported to the House a week or so ago, more than $2 billion of farmers' money has now been deposited in this scheme. The scheme offers tax benefits by allowing the money to be deposited free of tax in the deposit scheme, and then it is withdrawn at a time generally when a farmer's income is very low; so effectively he pays little or no tax. Around 43,000 Australian farmers now have FMDs - that is close to a third of all the farmers in the nation - and the average deposit is $48,000. The grain industry, for instance, has over half a billion dollars worth of investments in the Farm Management Deposit Scheme. Victoria has the largest number of FMD holders. They overtook both New South Wales and Queensland in the last quarter. New South Wales still has the highest value of deposits, with $547 million invested. There are 27 financial institutions receiving farm management deposits and offering products that farmers can use for this service. That is one of the significant changes that was made by the Deputy Prime Minister, when he was minister for agriculture, that revolutionised the FMD scheme and made it such an effective saving tool for farmers. The money no longer has to be given to the government. Farmers can place it with the financial institution of their choice and earn interest in the normal way.This scheme has been very helpful. Around $1 billion of that money is available now to farmers, if they choose to withdraw it, to help them through the difficult seasonal conditions which seem to be confronting our nation at the present time. That is an excellent example of many Australian farmers being in a position to help themselves. I know that there are others who have not had an opportunity to contribute because, for one reason or another, they have not enjoyed good seasons or good prices in the last couple of years. For farmers facing special needs, there are a range of other assistance programs, such as exceptional circumstances and the like, which will provide support for them. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme is an excellent example of a government responding to an industry's desire to help itself, and this product has certainly worked very well for the industry. </DOC>

 - As far as my understanding of the situation is concerned, there have not been any applications from Queensland. - Hang on; you mentioned Queensland and then you said `Brewarrina and Bourke'. I will deal with Queensland first. My understanding is that there have not been any applications from Queensland. The way this system operates, as I understand it, is that the applications are put in by the state governments. That is how they work. Until there is an application from Queensland, and until the Queensland government puts in an application, I do not think you can blame the federal government for dragging the chain. I am not blaming the state government, either. For heaven's sake, in case it has not occurred to the opposition, this is not an issue where the public wants state and federal governments slagging off at each other.  - They are fed up with that. They are fed up to the back teeth with that kind of thing happening on so many issues.  - Yes, withdraw it. I did not hear it, but -  - That is the position in relation to Queensland and, just as soon as we get an application from Queensland, of course that will be considered as expeditiously as possible. As far as Brewarrina and Bourke are concerned, the minister just explained the situation there, and I thought he gave a good explanation; didn't you?Government members - Yes!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and for his very strong advocacy, on behalf of Australian parents, of the school education that children receive. The government are very committed to doing everything we can to see that Australian students are able to find and be their best, not only in conventional education but also in vocational education and training and apprenticeships, and to see university as part of their life's horizon. Parents are increasingly concerned about a number of things. They want to know who is teaching their children; they are interested in the qualities of the teachers who are teaching their children; they want to know that their children are able to read, write, count and communicate when they leave school; and increasingly parents are looking for education to be delivered within a values based framework with which they feel particularly comfortable. It is rather interesting that, when I had the privilege to visit the electorate of Paterson and meet the member and about 20 principals from his electorate, one of the principals asked why there are, increasingly, parents who are more interested in these issues. The principal of the Medowie Christian School said to the group - and I think this is a very important issue that ought to be raised here - `Minister, I've got parents coming to me every single day and they are looking for three things out of education which I believe that your government's policies are delivering.' She said that the first thing they are looking for is values. They are looking for a school which teaches children about basic values which parents think are important. The second thing that they are looking for is identity. They are looking for schools which give their child a sense of identity. They want to be in a school where they feel their child is understood and known as a human being in a school community. And the third thing is that they are looking for discipline. Parents are increasingly interested in schools that are able to deliver uniforms, that are able to deliver diaries, that are able to reinforce the fundamentals that are critically important to education. It is rather interesting that the Victorian government has recently announced that finally it will be measuring year 7 literacy and numeracy benchmarks and reporting them against all national benchmarks. We will now have four states - Western Australia, Northern Territory, ACT and Victoria - that will be reporting literacy against national benchmarks. I will be very interested to see whether the currently Crean-led Australian Labor Party will be calling on the other jurisdictions to also report against national benchmarking. I thank the member for Paterson for his question. - Without notice, definitely. And especially I thank all members on this side for their commitment to values, identity and discipline in education.</DOC>

 - Without checking the relevant security data and then making an assessment as to whether it would be appropriate to divulge the information available to me, I cannot answer the question. - I remind the Leader of the Opposition that what Senator Hill said was phrased as a possibility, as the Attorney-General referred to. Senator Hill said:We know that within Australia there were those who were trained by Al Qaeda.And I know that there is no argument on that. He continued:We know there has been constant movement from Indonesia into Australia and that may well include JI supporters. - Let me read again what the Minister for Defence had to say:We know that within Australia there were those who were trained by Al Qaeda. We know there has been constant movement from Indonesia into Australia and that may well include JI supporters.It may even include JI operatives.He goes on to say:This is part of the security debate that we're currently having within the Cabinet and we're obviously concerned about it and we will be responding to it within the short period of time. - Then, in answer to another question:Well, it's in the last six months that we've started to understand this organisation better ...What the senator said last night does not merit the description that has been given to it by the Leader of the Opposition. I think what the senator did last night in a difficult situation like this -  - The circumstances that existed in this country prior to 12 October would have meant that a question such as that asked of Senator Hill last night perhaps would not have been asked, and that is understandable. Even if it had been asked, it would have been met with a response that most people would have accepted - that is, `I am not going to say anything at all about intelligence matters.' But, in the new circumstances in which this country finds itself, ministers, prime ministers and leaders of the opposition are faced with a situation where, on the one hand, if you do not inform the Australian public of what is in your possession without breaching and compromising sources, you are open to criticism; on the other hand, if you do try and take the public more into your confidence, you run the risk of being accused of not behaving in an appropriate fashion.Last night, in the light of the questions that were asked of him by the interviewer, I think Senator Hill tried to strike a judicious balance between those two constraints. He was not setting out to behave in an irresponsible fashion but, as is his character, he was endeavouring to be as candid as possible with the Australian public. What he had to say was: there may have been a movement of JI supporters; it might include JI operatives. I would have thought that was a statement that he should not be criticised for making. It is obvious that, in the environment within which we live, there might be such people who come into this country - and he is criticised for saying that! I do not understand why he is criticised for saying that. I think that is completely and utterly unreasonable. I defend the statements that were made by the senator last night and, as to the question of timing of knowledge, I have indicated to the Leader of the Opposition that I will examine the intelligence material on that. To the extent that it is possible for me to publicly provide more information, I am very happy to do so, subject to the obvious constraint that there are some things, as he knows, that cannot be said without creating problems. But I will have a look at that. It may well be that what comes out of that is that there are certain things that I will be able to say publicly, and there are other things that I will be able to privately communicate to the Leader of the Opposition. I will be happy to do that. But let me make it perfectly clear that what Senator Hill was saying last night was an honest attempt by him to inform the public, whilst not breaching any of the sensible norms of behaviour that ought to apply in relation to security matters.Can I also take the opportunity, as it is in the same general area, to say something on the legislation which has just passed the parliament. I do not think I am anticipating debate in this place.  - I make the point that, in the view of the government, it was always the case that it would have been better to have had a procedure whereby we were not reliant alone on action by the Security Council of the United Nations to proscribe a terrorist organisation. I think it is very important that the Australian public have this in mind: the first preference of the government was to have a capacity on the part of the Attorney-General to form a view without instruction from the United Nations about the existence -  -  - I do not mind, Mr Speaker. I was endeavouring to assist everybody, including the chair. It is the case that the procedure we have now improved was not, of course, the government's first preference. The government's first preference was not to rely entirely on the role of the United Nations, but I would like to join the Attorney-General in thanking the opposition for agreeing to expedite this legislation. I thank them for that, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General for the cooperative attitude they displayed in their discussions with me last night.</DOC>

 - Earlier today, along with the Minister for Revenue and the Minister for Health and Ageing, I announced the government's range of measures to deal with the medical indemnity crisis. Those measures represent, after months of discussion and negotiation with relevant parties, a very fair accommodation and a fair balance of the competing interests of the public, the medical profession and other groups and individuals who are concerned about this problem. Amongst the measures I announced today were: a willingness, subject to the approval of the New South Wales Supreme Court, to extend the guarantee until 31 December 2003; a willingness to heavily subsidise, up to the tune of 50 per cent of the difference between the premium and other benchmarks, the insurance premiums of the high-risk specialties, such as neurosurgery, obstetrics and others; and the willingness to subsidise 50 per cent of high-cost settlements resulting from particularly severe injuries or disabilities suffered as a result of medical negligence.The guarantee will be called upon to an extent which has, as yet, not been determined. The best estimate we have at the moment is that the incurred but not recorded liabilities are between $350 million and $500 million. If in fact there is a call on the guarantee to meet those liabilities, the cost of that will be recouped from the imposition of a levy on doctors who belong to medical defence organisations which have unfunded liabilities. I should assure doctors who are members of medical defence organisations which do not have unfunded liabilities that they will have no obligation to pay the levy. Arrangements will be made to fairly accommodate the position of retired doctors and part-time doctors. Obligations in relation to the levy will be relieved for the period of time that a doctor may, for a series of reasons, be out of the work force.I want to emphasise that this package of measures will only have enduring value and impact if it is accompanied by significant tort law reform. A start has been made with tort law reform, but we would like that process to go further, to be consistent and to be nationally cohesive. Having a national scheme is very desirable. We have made a start, but we still have a long way to go. I want to thank Senator Patterson and Senator Coonan, the two ministers, for the outstanding work that both of them have done in this area. I would like to thank the various organisations that have involved themselves in discussions and consultations with the government. This is a difficult issue. We need to preserve the critical mass of medical speciality in many parts of Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas. The government has acted in a balanced way to meet the difficulties. I commend the package to all those concerned. I believe it strikes a fair balance and will go a long way towards preserving the benefits of the specialities to the Australian community.</DOC>

 - The Minister for Defence said last night:We know there has been constant movement from Indonesia into Australia and that may well include JI supporters. It may even include JI operatives.He then went on to indicate:Well, it's in the last six months that we've started to understand this organisation better ...The Leader of the Opposition will know that, in order to successfully enlist support for the proscription of an organisation in the United Nations, you need to have a considerable body of evidence and you also need to have the support of other countries. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that it was the insistence of the opposition which resulted in a situation where it is only through the United Nations route that you can proscribe an organisation. -  - No, no. The Leader of the Opposition has chosen to raise questions on this. He is basically saying, `You should have unilaterally done more,' without acknowledging that the opposition has left us with one path, and that one path was to go through the United Nations. I repeat that, in answer to the first question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I said that I would consult the intelligence sources, that if there was any further information I could publicly provide, I would and that, if, in augmentation of that, there was some information I could privately provide to him, I would do that as well. That is the response I gave to that question and that is the response I give to this one.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I appreciate the interest that he -  -  - I mean the honourable member for Mallee. Thank you. I appreciate the newly lively Labor Party - after its caucus meeting yesterday - giving me that advice. Yes, he is the member for Mallee. John Forrest is his name. -  - As I said yesterday in the House, Senator Hill and I will be meeting with our American counterparts Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld in Washington next Monday night and Tuesday for the annual Australia-US Ministerial Consultations. The annual security talks, amongst other things, do highlight the very close alliance there is between Australia and the United States and the unashamed support of this government for the alliance with the United States. We are countries that share common values and at this very difficult time for the world, when our civilisation broadly defined is being threatened by terrorist organisations, it is essential that countries like Australia and the United States cooperate very closely in that fight against terrorism. Clearly, during these discussions there will be a substantial focus on this issue. The opposition have asked questions today about the listing of Jemaah Islamiah in the United Nations. We and the United States, by way of illustration, have worked very closely together on trying to ensure that there is not only sufficient international support for the listing of Jemaah Islamiah but, very significantly, that there is not international opposition to the listing of Jemaah Islamiah, because if such opposition were to be forthcoming then that listing would fail, and clearly that is something we do not want to happen in the United Nations. I use that as a small illustration, but one that is timely today, of the degree of cooperation there is between our two countries in this fight against terrorism. Of course the government continues to maintain its commitment to the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan with the deployment of Australian forces there. Obviously the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, the role our troops are playing there and the status of the situation in Afghanistan will be a considerable focus of the discussions. So too will be the issue of weapons of mass destruction. This government has never made any secret of its enormous concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There are two particular instances here which will be in the forefront of our minds next week. The first is Iraq, where we are working and the United States is particularly working through the United Nations Security Council to get a new Security Council resolution passed, a tougher resolution which we all hope Iraq will comply with and which will lead to the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Equally we will be talking about North Korea because there is no doubt that we in Australia, as well as particularly the Americans, are deeply concerned about the revelations made recently that North Korea has a uranium enrichment capability. Indeed, this morning I called the North Korean Ambassador to my office to take the opportunity to express our concerns about the breakdown, as this clearly is, of the agreed framework negotiated by President Clinton and the North Koreans in, from recollection, 1994. The fact that North Korea would be now building and maintaining a uranium enrichment plant and would be enriching uranium goes again to this whole issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. So overhanging the discussions in Washington will be the two great issues that the world needs to confront, and they are two issues which, if bound together, present a deeply troubling world. They are the issues of terrorism and of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This will be an excellent opportunity for Australia and the United States to build on their already excellent cooperation in addressing these great global challenges.</DOC>

I will be -  - I have accepted it. - No, I said I was. - I accept that I would have said something substantially to that effect because the legislation was then an accomplished fact. But let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that it remains the case that when the legislation left this place it had three methods: it had jury, it had United Nations and it had government listing - and you took government listing out. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and his interest in the economy. I can inform him that today's consumer price index for the September quarter of 2002 shows that inflation in Australia remains contained, with a rise of 0.7 per cent for the quarter. That would be an annualised rate of about 2.8 per cent. In through-the-year terms, the CPI moved by 3.2 per cent because the abnormally low September 2001 quarter dropped out. But as the September 2002 quarter showed, inflation if anything is probably trending down, consistent with the government's forecast of a 2½ per cent CPI through the 2002-03 year.In the September quarter, price increases were recorded for housing. Fruit and vegetables were up 4.2 per cent, with vegetable prices rising significantly due to drought. Holiday travel and accommodation were up. Conversely, prices of clothing and footwear were down. Meat and seafood were down. Petrol was down and motor vehicle sales declined. The low inflation which is evident in the economy is confirmed by the producer price index data released earlier this week. It shows that there are limited upstream price pressures. The broadest measure of producer prices - the final commodities index - increased by 0.5 per cent in the September quarter and by 1.4 per cent through the year. So with moderate wage growth, with no upstream pressures on commodities and with high productivity, the absence of price pressures in the Australian economy appears to be confirmed.We live in a very difficult economic climate internationally. The United States have been going through recession since 2001 and are emerging - but they are emerging very slowly and are much weaker than expected. Europe is very subdued. There are difficulties in continental Europe, in particular. Japan is in recession again. It is their third recession in five years. Notwithstanding that very difficult international climate, the Australian economy continues to grow and to grow as one of the strongest economies of the developed world. With our growth between three and four per cent and with low inflation prices, this is a good climate for investment. As I have indicated before, the government certainly hopes that, as the housing cycle comes off, business investment will take up some of the slack in the economy. There has been good growth in a difficult international environment. There is low inflation. It is important that we keep good economic policy rolling in Australia to get good outcomes for the men and women of Australia.</DOC>

 - In relation to al-Qaeda, I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the response given by the Attorney-General at the conclusion of the debate. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in order to comply with the terms of the legislation it was necessary, so I am advised, for an assessment to be made inter alia of a lot of intelligence material from foreign sources. Bearing that in mind and given the Leader of the Opposition's reference to the need to preserve confidentiality in relation to intelligence sources, it was necessary in the course of the process, so I am advised, for that material to be assessed and a judgment to be made as to what material could be used publicly and what material could not be used publicly. So the Leader of the Opposition's attention is drawn to what was said by the Attorney-General in relation to that, in reply to his attack on the Attorney-General during the debate.As far as Jemaah Islamiah is concerned, I refer the Leader of the Opposition to what was said by the foreign minister a few moments ago. The process of proscribing an organisation by the United Nations involves - as the Leader of the Opposition would know - enlisting support from other countries. - The US, as you know, is not the only permanent member of the Security Council. - Yes, but it is not much good initiating something that does not get through. - I just repeat that, as the foreign minister pointed out, in order to get something listed you need the support of other countries. It is only commonsense that you investigate the availability of that support and be satisfied that your foray is going to be successful before you initiate it. To put this into context, here we have the opposition saying that we have not done enough. But can I remind the opposition that on 27 June, after this legislation passed the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, put out a press release that quite literally boasted about the way in which the opposition had watered the legislation down. There is no other description. Amongst other things, this is what Senator Faulkner said:Labor has achieved amendments that will ensure - then he goes on to say:·	the Government's proposal to give the Attorney-General the power to ban organisations never sees the light of day ...In other words, they were boasting that the legislation had been made weaker. In parliamentary debate you are entitled to do that. - When the legislation was passed I accepted that that was the best legislation that we could get. But, having watered the legislation down, you now come into this place and you say it is not strong enough. - That is basically what you are saying.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I know he takes a very keen interest in the defence industry, particularly in his electorate. This morning the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, and I announced the successful completion of negotiations for Australia's entry into the decade-long development of the US joint strike fighter program. The decision means an investment by Australia of up to $US150 million over 10 years for us to become a level 3 partner and it puts Australia at the forefront of developing one of the world's most advanced combat aircraft over the next 30 years. The joint strike fighter program offers Australian aerospace industry an unprecedented opportunity to participate in this enormous project. Only companies from countries that have entered as partners will be considered for this program.This program initially is worth some $US200 billion, with the potential to grow to two or three times that level. This participation in the development phase gives Australian firms an opportunity of winning a share of that very lucrative project. With Team Australia put together by my department and Defence, we will see an opportunity for Australia to push the merits of our own industries. The good news is that in today's mail there are some 19 letters of intent to Australian companies to participate in putting in tenders for this program. Whilst the bigger companies, such as Boeing, Hawker de Havilland and Raytheon, will receive letters, there are also some 16 smaller companies, some quite small, that will have the opportunity to put forward their credentials. These are companies like the one I visited this morning, CEA Technologies, which is based in an outer Canberra suburb and, as we speak, is exporting radar to the US defence forces.The indications are that these contracts could initially be worth some $400 million. Of course, if we are successful with the initial contracts, we will see much more substantial work coming to Australia in the longer term. That work could be worth literally billions and billions of dollars. Apart from allowing Australian companies to participate in tenders, it gives Australia, if we choose the joint strike fighter as the replacement for the FA18, the opportunity not only to purchase that fighter cheaper or at a lower price but also to receive the fighter sooner than we would were we not part of the program. The greatest outcome of today's announcement is that Australia's aerospace industry, which already has a one per cent share of the world market, will be able to display its wares not only to Lockheed Martin and the project participants but right around the world, giving it the potential to grow even further.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Griffith for his question. Having read the article on the front of the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, I obviously investigated this article. I have been advised that the relevant Australian agency and its United States counterpart have searched their databases this morning and have not found a report matching that mentioned in the media out of Washington. As the Prime Minister in particular, I and others have stated, we have been advised that Australian intelligence agencies have searched their records and they have identified no material that specifically warned of the Bali attack. The Prime Minister has asked the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to review all intelligence that may be relevant to the Bali atrocity. I understand the inspector-general will be reporting to the Prime Minister as soon as possible.It is inevitable in the wake of what occurred in Bali that there will be further commentary and various allegations of intelligence failures, but all relevant material will be thoroughly examined in the inspector-general's review. The government has warned for some time now of the heightened threat to Australians in the region. These concerns have inter alia been reflected in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's travel advisory notices over the last few months and in ministerial and prime ministerial statements from time to time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. I can report something quite unusual to the House, something which is almost unprecedented in recent parliaments: a workplace relations bill which has passed the Senate with cross-party support. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Registration and Accountability of Organisations) Bill 2002, which the Senate passed last week, brings the governance arrangements for industrial organisations into the modern era. In particular, it imposes on the officers of unions and employer organisations duties and responsibilities akin to those of company directors. It means that the books and elections of these organisations will be subject to more scrutiny, accountability and transparency. These are important changes and they should mean over time that we will have a better and cleaner workplace relations system.This legislation completes work that was begun about three years ago by my distinguished predecessor, Mr Peter Reith, and that I am pleased to say was supported at different times by the former shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, the current shadow minister, the member for Barton, and Senator Murray. I thank them for the constructive approach they adopted to this legislation. I can inform the House that earlier drafts of this legislation have benefited immensely from the constructive suggestions made by the ACTU and the peak employer organisations. This legislation shows that all parties in this House are united in their commitment to democratic accountability and it shows that, even on a matter as contentious as workplace relations normally is, it is possible to find common ground.</DOC>

 - If memory serves me well, on 11 October I was in South-East Asia; I was not in Australia at that time. But my attention was drawn to the statement made by the Attorney-General. If the Attorney-General makes a statement, I typically do not equally repeat the statement. The statement was made and it was given publicity. I would not have thought there was any need for other ministers to issue similar statements. In relation to the US caution that was issued, I made this point to the House the other day -  - To throw some light on the US worldwide caution, which might interest the honourable member and to put it into some perspective: on 10 October the United States issued a worldwide caution which was focused on a specific threat made against American interests, as contained within the then most recent Osama bin Laden tape. The bin Laden threat reflected in the US caution of 10 October and an FBI alert of 9 October were referred to in a DFAT travel bulletin. If you are talking about whether I issued a statement, I personally did not. The travel bulletin of DFAT is the equivalent of the US worldwide caution, as the Americans call it. That was issued on 11 October Australian time and was entitled `Terrorist threat to United States interests in the United States and overseas'. This bulletin, which was posted on the DFAT web site, said that:In the light of the warnings by the United States Government - and these were the warnings in the US caution - Australian travellers and residents overseas are advised to remain alert to their own security. So, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in responding to that US worldwide caution - which was based on the Osama bin Laden tape - responded appropriately with their own statement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his obvious interest in this very important issue of public policy. Today the government have put up information on our web site announcing the successful rollover of employment services contracts to the 60 per cent of companies and individual business sites as part of our Employment Services Contract 3, which is a $1.5 billion delivery of employment services to the Australian community. This is delivering on our 2001 election commitment. That information is available today for all members on our web site at www.workplace.gov.au.The government's Job Network has been a rousing success; in fact, it has now been adopted by many countries - not in total but certainly parts of it have - around the world. What we have done is to recognise the high performance of many of our Job Network members and, in doing so, reward them for servicing the government's needs, as well as business needs and the needs of the unemployed in this country. By doing so, we will prevent a great disruption to employment services. These contracts come into effect from 1 July 2003, as part of an improved suite of projects and programs which will deliver better employment services to our unemployed.Of particular interest to members in regional and rural Australia - as there has been comment about whether there will be a reduction in services in some regions - is that, in metropolitan Australia, 60 per cent of businesses rolled over and, in regional and remote areas, 61 per cent rolled over. Of those we have had responses, accepting the government's invitation, from 59 per cent in remote and regional Australia and in metropolitan Australia. In the member for La Trobe's electorate, organisations such as the Salvation Army will continue to deliver a fine high-quality service. In other regional areas such as the electorate of Cunningham around Wollongong, for argument's sake - an important part of Australia - IPC and Gemcell will continue to deliver high-quality services. The government remains committed to the unemployed in those regions.The new initiatives in Job Network 3 build on the success of Job Network 1 and Job Network 2. We will be introducing a job seeker account so that there will be specific money that is quarantined and that cannot go to the bottom line of the organisation but must be spent on the unemployed. We will be giving unemployed workers earlier access to the Job Network in a streamlined fashion so that they can go from Centrelink to the Job Network member and remain with them throughout their period of unemployment, so that they have a partnership arrangement. This shows the government is dedicated to getting them back into work. Importantly for those unfortunate individuals that find themselves becoming redundant, from 1 July, when a business finds that its workers will be made redundant, the government will intervene before they become unemployed and they will have access to Job Search training while they are still in work so that that connection back into the workplace can be made.There will also be a guaranteed place for every unemployed person for intensive support and customised assistance, with a service guarantee underpinning the entire service. This will be underpinned by a very strong code of conduct to ensure that every Job Network member delivering employment services on behalf of the Commonwealth throughout Australia will provide quality services. Where that is not fulfilled, this government will act in a very strenuous manner. Forty per cent of this business will now go to open tender, and I invite all members of the employment services industry in Australia to visit the web site - the tender documents are available there - and to join the many fantastic for-profit, community based and church based organisations that have collectively delivered first-class employment services to Australia's unemployed.</DOC>

 - Regrettably, we live in an environment where there are frequent threats to not only United States interests but more broadly to Western interests. As I have discussed in the House before, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through a number of mechanisms - through its travel advisories, through embassy bulletins and through worldwide cautions or travel bulletins, as they are called - endeavours to keep travellers up to date with these developments as they take place. At the time this particular piece of information became available, I think the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did precisely the right thing. I was overseas during that particular period of time but I am satisfied with what the department did; they did the right thing. There has been a series of other threats - pieces of information about the danger to Westerners and others overseas.I will use this opportunity to make a point. While I was overseas, amongst other things - quite apart from spending time in Yogyakarta with the Indonesian foreign minister, the Philippines foreign minister and others, talking not just generally about the issue of regional terrorism but specifically about the problem of Jemaah Islamiah - I went on from there to Kuala Lumpur where I attended the World Economic Forum. I was engaged in substantial debates there including some during which, at the time, our position was criticised and was seen by people as being controversial with regard to the concerns that we had and have about Jemaah Islamiah, about Abu Bakar Bashir and about regional terrorist organisations. The point I would make, very importantly, is that the government has been arguing, not just here in Australia but very strenuously throughout South-East Asia, that Jemaah Islamiah and its links to al-Qaeda, and the general issue of terrorism in the region, are major issues to address. I think the government could not have done more to draw the region's attention to these problems. Through travel advisories, travel bulletins and embassy advisories, it has continued to keep the Australian public up to date with the general concerns. With regard to the situation in Bali and not having specific information relating to Bali, tragically we were unable to give any warning in relation to that specific incident.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question on small business. I can advise the House that one of the state finalists in the Telstra national and state small business awards was from Mandurah in the member for Canning's electorate - the Miami Bakehouse. It is a great little bakery, I understand, that offers gluten-free products, and it is now expanding to two new bakery centres in Perth. The finalists reflect the diverse range of business opportunities available in Australia. For example, a Commonwealth government microbusiness award state winner was Freycinet Adventures, which is a new ecotourism company that has seen client numbers grow by 40 per cent each year since starting business only six years ago. There is a happy coincidence there. The winner of the microbusiness award was a company by the name of Bow Wow Meow Pty Ltd, based in the electorate of Wentworth. Its founder, Amy Lynden, found a niche market for pet tags and now distributes her product through 1,500 vet and pet stores across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. That is a great story about small business exports.We had national and state winners, including Meadowbank Wines from Tasmania, Audio Solutions from the Australian Capital Territory, Cresta Electronics from Queensland, Cirrus Real Time Processing Systems from New South Wales, Envisage Technology from Victoria, the Sprout Factory from Western Australia and Rorke's Drift Bar and Cafe from the Northern Territory. I am sure the member for Solomon has been there, as have a few other people. The national winner of the Telstra small business awards was a company from South Australia by the name of Resourceco. This is a great Australia success story. At the age of 22, a young guy by the name of Simon Brown was walking past a construction site, saw a lot of disused rubble and thought: `Here's an opportunity to make some money.' Ten years later, he now employs 40 people recycling up to 600,000 tonnes of concrete and asphalt waste every year, is now expanding interstate and expects turnover to reach $15 million this year - a great small business. I spoke to Simon just before question time, and he has a message for the Treasurer. He says to tell the Treasurer that the economy is ticking along nicely. That is straight from the coalface. All of these businesses are winners. We are proud of what they do and we are proud of the way that small business is helping to grow the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is, no, I was not. If Mr Souris did say that, I disagree with him. I disagree very strongly with him if he has made that statement. I intend to pursue this matter with all of the state premiers. We will only be able to have an introductory discussion about it tomorrow, because -  - I would not bet on that. I would counsel the member for Wills not to suggest that we will not have a proposal. If I have a proposal in this area, I will disclose it firstly to the premiers. This is an issue that the public are concerned about. They do not really care about politics on this; they are worried about the safety of their communities. It is something that might even end up crossing party lines, and that would probably not be an unwelcome thing. An allegation has been made by the member for Werriwa about gun-running. I do not know what definition he gives to gun-running - I do not know what definition different people give to it - but I will check the allegation that has been made by him. I draw the attention of the member for Werriwa and others who are interested in this to the front page of today's Herald Sun. It says it all. The reality is that there is a very strong case for whatever laws you have to allow the operation of legitimate sporting shooting. There is no argument about that.Interestingly enough, in the debate that has followed the tragedy - and I hope I take appropriate care not to deal in any specificity with the tragedy at Monash University, but debate has inevitably followed that - reference has been made to the firearms involved, not in the tragedy but in the possession of a certain party. There are a number listed, and the Herald Sun of course had photographs of them and posed the quite legitimate rhetorical question: how on earth can these be legally available? I think it is a fair question. I think it is a question that every Victorian would be asking. It is a question which people right across the nation would be asking. It is one of the issues that I think the premiers and I together, without finger pointing, have a responsibility to try and answer.Could I just make the point in the context of sporting shooting that the firearms listed would not be used, I am advised, in Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games or world championship pistol events, where contestants will use highly specialised pistols. Nor would they qualify for use in these events due to their characteristics - that is, calibre and shot capacity. The point I make is that the immediate riposte to the critics of stronger controls who say, `If you ban these, you're going to interfere with the Commonwealth Games and the sport and all of that,' is that that is not valid. I am told, in the interests of fairness, balance and accuracy, that each of these hand guns can be used in certain sports, including shooting events endorsed by the ISSF and the SSAA - for instance, service pistol event and action match event, which do not appear to restrict the type of hand gun that may be used.The point I make emphatically is that none of the firearms listed - that is, the Smith and Wesson 0.357 calibre, the Smith and Wesson 0.38 calibre, the Beretta air pistol, the Beretta 0.22 calibre rim-fire pistol, the Beretta 0.32 calibre pistol, the Taurus 0.40 calibre pistol and the CZ nine-millimetre pistol - I am advised, would be used in Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games or world championships. Whilst I concede and support the concept that, whatever further is done, there should be a proper carve-out for a certain degree of sports shooting, I do not think that we should automatically assume that, if you ban any of the weapons I have mentioned, you are going to prevent people training for, or participating in, Commonwealth Games or Olympic Games events.This is a very difficult issue, and it is one the community is rightly concerned about. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom, and nobody is flawless, at any level of government. I am not going there saying, `We're perfect and you're completely wrong.' It is not the attitude that I am going to adopt when I talk to the premiers tomorrow. The one thing that I ask we do not hear is somebody, before we even have the discussion, saying, `My laws are perfect and they don't need to be changed.' The reality is that the laws on this issue throughout the nation cannot be perfect. - I intend, consistent with the responsibilities that I have in the constitutional reach of the Commonwealth's power, to sit down with the premiers, starting tomorrow, and work out whether we can have a tougher regime. - As for a coastguard, the formation of a coastguard will not contribute to the solution to this problem; it will contribute to the weakening of the Royal Australian Navy. This is very interesting. The great international analogy to the coastguard is in which country? The United States of America. Apparently, there is a connection between a coastguard and gun safety. I rest my case.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. Given his support for science and innovation, he well appreciates how it underpins the nation's economic prosperity and fulfils many of our social and environmental aspirations as a community. The unique and outstandingly successful scientific program, the Cooperative Research Centres Program, achieves that very objective by bringing science agencies, universities and industry together in a partnership. It was the brainchild of Professor Ralph Slatyer, the then Chief Scientist, in 1990, and it has been a great success ever since. In the intervening 12 years, $7 billion has been invested in the cooperative research centres by all of the participants. This includes $1.8 billion by the Commonwealth under the program, $1.8 billion by universities, $1.3 billion directly by industry and almost $1 billion by CSIRO.The government are so committed to, and supportive of, the CRC program that we have committed $150 million to it this year. Over the next three years, by way of Backing Australia's Ability, we are providing an additional $227 million to support more and larger CRCs, greater SME involvement and international collaboration. Each year, the House will be interested to know, the CRCs support around 1,700 researchers and involve more than 900 companies. While two-thirds are larger companies, there is a rising participation rate and number of SMEs.Examples of recent achievements include environmental projects, such as the development of new plastics which are biodegradable. One type of packaging dissolves in water; another degrades within four weeks of being buried in soil or composted. They also include medical breakthroughs, with more than 400,000 people in over 40 countries now having contact lenses they can wear continuously for 30 days and nights; conservation, with the use of CRC developed technologies resulting in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary water treatment costs by state water authorities; and technology. Yesterday I visited FedSat, which is the satellite developed by the CRC for Satellite Systems and which will be launched later this year in Japan. An amazing collaboration of industry, academia and the CSIRO brought about the first satellite launch in Australia since the middle of the 1960s.We will continue to monitor and assess the operation and success of CRCs, given the commitment of and level of investment by all participants, not least of all government. Senator Minchin, my predecessor as science minister, amended the guidelines under which CRCs could receive funding to have greater emphasis on commercial outcomes and greater participation by SMEs. There will be supplementary funding for existing CRCs. We will continue to nurture and support the program, but not all CRCs can be outstanding successes. Some will perform and succeed better than others, and we want to build on the successes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question relating to breast cancer and its consequences. I note that many honourable members are today wearing a pink ribbon to publicise breast cancer awareness. It is something which, I am sure, all members in this place are committed to. By way of overview, breast cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths and, in women, the most registrable cancer. The risk of developing breast cancer before the age of 75 is estimated to be one in 11, and the incidence of breast cancer, in fact, has been on the increase in this country since the early 1980s. However, the death rates due to breast cancer have remained relatively stable over that period of time.It is important in relation to the matter of breast cancer that preventive measures are undertaken. There is great encouragement by the Commonwealth and the states and territories of women to undertake mammography screening and there is a national screening program under the auspices of BreastScreen Australia which is targeted specifically at women without symptoms aged between 50 and 69, although this program is available to all women over the age of 40, including those in the risk categories of 40 to 49 years and 70 years and older. In fact, this program operates at some 500 locations nationwide, and there has been a significant increase in breast screening in Australia since the beginning of the program just over 10 years ago, with over 56,000 women now being screened across Australia each month. The program's aim is to achieve a 70 per cent screening rate amongst women aged 50 to 69 years. At present the screening rate is 54 per cent, so we have a way to go in relation to that program. - The honourable member asked me specifically about the provision of prostheses. This is something which each of the states and territories at the present time do to a greater or lesser extent. The Northern Territory is to be commended in this regard because public patients get their first prosthesis free. So too is the Australian Capital Territory, where the government pays $210 towards the cost of the first prosthesis for each patient. However, although the other states in Australia have accepted the responsibility to provide these prostheses through their public hospital programs, the level to which they provide them varies greatly from state to state. - If the member for Fowler is so concerned about this, she ought to be urging the health minister in New South Wales - and equally, other members on the other side, the health ministers in their states -  - to match the funding which is being provided by, for example, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. Overall, the Commonwealth does contribute to this through the Australian health care agreements with the states over five years. There has been a 28 per cent increase in funding over the period of the last agreement. This is an area in which I believe all honourable members on both sides of politics in this House should be urging those states that do not do as well as the others to provide similar degrees of treatment.</DOC>

 - I particularly want to thank the member for Riverina. I recently visited her electorate when she presented an award to one of the finalists in the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole Achievement Awards of 2001: Mission Australia, in a project with 2AAA, a community based radio station. It was certainly inspirational. It has provided a lot of additional resources there. I announced last week the opening of nominations for the 2002 Prime Minister's Work for the Dole Achievement Awards. -  - Immediately you get these laughs from the opposition. Whenever you get up to talk about these things, you get interjections from the shadow minister. - When you recognise the achievements of people who are unemployed, you build their self-esteem and you give them something positive, which is what this government is about. -  - Every time we get up here to talk about the achievements in the communities, the achievements of young people, all we get is derision from those that sit opposite. - The Prime Minister's Work for the Dole Achievement Awards are a fantastic recognition of work that is done in the community by individuals, supervisors and community groups. Unlike the stereotyping of Work for the Dole - just to give you a quick snapshot - these are some of the activities that Australia's unemployed engage in in building better communities, getting work experience and feeling good about themselves: child care, education, retail, horticulture, arts, computing, clerical work, aged care, disabilities, radio productions, restoration and sports. - That is only a snapshot of what is available. There are those opposite and many of those that sit on this side of the House that have gone along and seen the inspiration and the energy at the nights in the Great Hall when we recognise these people and their contributions to Australia. I ask anybody in the community - either in this House or in the wider community - to nominate someone for a Work for the Dole award. The categories are best Work for the Dole participant; best Work for the Dole activity, which includes caring for people, caring for the community, caring for our environment and caring for our heritage; and best Work for the Dole supervisor. As I say, anyone can nominate a participant or a supervisor. They simply go to our web site, www.workplace.gov.au. Nominations close on 18 November. I recommend everybody get in and support Work for the Dole and Australia's unemployed.</DOC>

 - The second part of that question, of course, is false so I will come to the first part of the question. The Commonwealth provides support through the -  - No, the second part was false, as I said. I know the tactics committee of the Labor Party works on the principle that, if they farm these questions out and they are repeated often enough, people will start believing them. But it is false. The first part of the question concerns the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. In relation to the Commonwealth's involvement in housing, the Commonwealth, in agreement with the states, provides money under the agreement for the supply of public housing. This has been an area that the states have traditionally administered and where the Commonwealth has provided additional funding. In addition to the sums that it provides for public housing, the Commonwealth provides rent assistance. That, of course, goes to people to help them with their rent should they be in the private sector as well. It is therefore necessary to judge the Commonwealth's contribution as the collection of both its funding for public housing and its funding for rent assistance. Putting the two together, the Commonwealth outlays have increased in real terms by $232 million since 1997-98. In addition to that, an extra $75 million was provided for Indigenous housing over four years, from 2002-03, as was announced in last year's budget. The relevant minister, Senator Vanstone, will be meeting the state ministers on, I think, Friday to discuss negotiations for a new agreement. If I know the states, they will be asking for more money. I do not think I am the first Treasurer to observe that one should never stand between a state minister and a bucket of money. If I know them at all, they will be asking for more money. Senator Vanstone will be negotiating both in relation to the outcomes and in relation to fiscal responsibility.In relation to housing, if I may finish by observing this, one of the things that has helped many young couples into the housing market is low interest rates. Can you think what young couples today would be doing if they were paying Labor's 17 per cent interest rate? To have interest rates at low levels as they are now has helped many young Australians into the housing market. We like to help young Australians; we like them to have a family home.</DOC>

 - I believe I speak for members on both sides of the House in welcoming the unanimous passage of the resolution which imposes new and very strict conditions of compliance on Iraq. The passage of the resolution is a tribute to the commonsense of all members of the Security Council. It should also be said that it is a vindication of the strong and patient attitude adopted by the President of the United States. It is important to make the observation that, if the United States had not persisted with the attitude it has taken over recent months, it is unlikely that the Security Council would have addressed this issue as vigorously as it has, and it is certain in my view that the resolution that emerged from the Security Council over the weekend would not have been adopted. The United Nations now has stronger authority for inspections than from earlier resolutions. I hope - and indeed the entire world hopes - that Iraq will comply, and comply genuinely. If Iraq complies genuinely with the terms of this resolution then, in the words of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, `considerable suffering and adversity can be avoided for the people of Iraq'. It is encouraging that there are signs emerging that Iraq will accept the terms of the resolution. It is early days yet, but it is to be hoped that those signs do bear fruit and do turn out to be the case. The resolution contains a number of key elements. Iraq is in material breach of existing resolutions and, in the words of the resolution, has one final opportunity to comply. The resolution asserts that false statements or omissions in the declaration required of Iraq represent a material breach. Iraq is required to provide immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access and has seven days to confirm its intention to comply with the resolution. Iraq is required to provide a full declaration of its chemical, biological or nuclear - military or civilian - programs within 30 days. Inspections are to be resumed within 45 days and the Security Council must be updated after 60 days of inspections. The Security Council has warned repeatedly that Iraq would face serious consequences if it did not comply. The world wants Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to be identified and destroyed. The world is concerned, because of Iraq's track record, that those weapons of mass destruction could be used against other countries and could be used again against the people of Iraq, as they have been in the past. The world is also rightly concerned about the consequences of weapons of mass destruction ever falling into the hands of terrorists. Therefore, there is an accumulation of powerful and compelling reasons as to why this resolution was necessary and why it is a welcome development that it was carried unanimously. The Australian government and, I believe, the great bulk of the Australian people very warmly welcome that development.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Of course I have spoken to him. On the information available to me, I do not think Senator Alston has behaved in any way improperly in this matter, nor does the Victoria Police think he has, because on 23 October the Victoria Police issued a statement in the following terms: `At no time has any outside party attempted to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene in this matter.' That is a conclusive repudiation of the pathetic attempt of the Leader of the Opposition to generate something out of this.The minister has not behaved improperly. If the Leader of the Opposition is not content to rely on the assurance of the minister or my assurance on that matter, then he might at least accept the word of the Victoria Police. The Victoria Police have said, `At no time has any outside party attempted to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene in this matter.' Those are very clear words. The mere making of a telephone call is not of itself improper. The minister has indicated that he made a telephone call; he has acknowledged that, and he has provided an explanation. The relevant thing here is whether it was improper. It is not improper per se to make a phone call. It is improper in circumstances such as this to pressure, influence, coerce or intervene. We have the word of the Victoria Police - which I am prepared to accept - that there was no coercion, intervention or pressure. I think the Leader of the Opposition should accept the word of the Victoria Police as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question and for his interest in the Australian economy. The international economy continues to look more bleak; in particular, the developments in the United States - probably reflected in the cut of 50 official basis points by the US Fed last week - indicate fears about the American recovery and whether or not it has stalled. In addition to that, growth is sluggish in Europe, and Japan remains in recession.Despite these difficulties, Australia continues to perform well overall and most international forecasts - for example, the Economist forecast of this month - predict that Australia will have the strongest growth of the developed nations of the world both in 2002 and 2003. In addition to that, the labour force figures for October, which were released late last week, showed that unemployment actually fell to six per cent, which is equal to the lowest unemployment rate recorded since the great recession of April 1990. After that recession, which was dubbed by Labor `the recession we had to have', unemployment was above 10 per cent for 28 consecutive months. The figure for October 2002 - at six per cent - is the lowest figure since then.Notwithstanding that, the risks that we see for the economy are on the downside. Firstly, the international economy continues to disappoint. Secondly, the effect of the drought on the economy is becoming greater and more pronounced as the severity of the drought takes hold. ABARE has put out crop forecasts showing that Australia's crop harvest will be slashed, forecasting the possibility of that detracting up to one per cent from growth in the current financial year, and assessments to that effect have been made by the Reserve Bank in its statement on monetary conditions today. The government will be taking into account all of these effects when it updates its forecast in the midyear review, which will be at the end of this month. As I have said, our budget forecast of 3¾ per cent would be affected by downside factors in the international economy and in relation to the drought. Nonetheless, we continue to lead the developed world in growth and employment generation. The number of jobs that have been generated this calendar year is 164,000, and 37,000 over the course of 2002 were full-time jobs. Over the course of the government's period of office, the increase in employment is over one million jobs. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the Australian economy, the creation of those jobs means so much to young Australians, their families and all those who rely on people in the work force.Good economic policy needs good leadership, and we continue to provide that leadership. We call on the Senate to enact all of our budget measures, including those that have already been defeated. We will be preparing those and presenting them to the Senate again to give the Senate the opportunity to reconsider its position in relation to those budget measures because important budget measures for the long-term sustainability of the Australian economy - good economic policy - are opportunities for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government warmly welcomes the regional telecommunications inquiry, which gives a full and balanced assessment and picture of regional telecommunications. It is worth noting that the report states that the government has responded positively and comprehensively to the Besley inquiry's recommendations of two years ago, and that arrangements have been put in place to address community concerns, including mobile phone services, which is a constant irritant in many areas in regional Australia.Overall the Estens report is a positive for the government and the commitment we have made to continually upgrade telecommunications in regional areas. The report recommends priority be given to a number of particulars - for instance, rural exchange upgrades, broadband width speed and the like - and the government will look at these recommendations, some 39 in all, to consolidate and complement the actions we have already taken over the last two years. We endorse the approach taken by the inquiry, which was to put it on the table to see what needed fixing and what needed to be brought up to a better level of service and provision. It is interesting that implicit in the member's question is an endorsement of the Estens inquiry, which, if my memory serves me correctly, he was very critical of at the time of its establishment -  - A `whitewash', he says. He was very critical of it at the time of its establishment, as he was with the Besley inquiry - discredit it, but use those parts of it that might fit his political agenda or his biased views. The government will now carefully consider its response to the Estens inquiry. The government has made it clear that it will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians. It is a positive, balanced report, which the government will respond to. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. I am very pleased to inform the House that the detail of legislation referring constitutional power for counterterrorism matters to the Commonwealth was finalised at a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Fremantle last Friday. This follows the historic agreement between the Prime Minister and state leaders earlier this year whereby the states agreed to refer power to the Commonwealth to coordinate responses to all national terrorist situations. This agreement is the most significant development in the management of terrorism threats in the past 20 years. The effect will be that the Howard government's important package of counterterrorism legislation enacted earlier this year will not have any unforeseen gaps. We will cover the field and ensure that any terrorist act committed in Australia will be the subject of criminal offences and hopefully, in due course, prosecution. We will be able to pursue terrorists anywhere and the community can be confident we will do just that.We are committed to hunting down all those who would threaten the safety of our families and communities and bringing those people to justice. I welcome the strong support from my state counterparts for the Howard government's new counterterrorism laws. We are now in a position to finalise the legislation so that each state can enact referral legislation as quickly as possible. I have urged my state counterparts to do everything they can to pass the legislation as a matter of urgency. Since the September 11 attacks on the United States, the government has acted swiftly to introduce new policy measures and to provide more resources for our security and intelligence agencies. The recent attacks in Bali have strengthened our resolve to ensure these measures are put in place immediately.On the legislative side, the package of counterterrorism legislation was passed in the middle of the year and parliament is currently considering a bill to enhance ASIO's ability to gather information. Shortly, a bill will be presented to the parliament creating an international murder offence. Our counterterrorism laws are built on strong constitutional grounds. We cannot afford to take the chance that the laws can be effectively challenged by those with an interest in getting around them. We must make them as watertight as possible. The proposed reference of powers by the states will do just that. I welcome the development and look forward to the continuing cooperation of the states and of the opposition in dealing with the ongoing threat of terrorism.</DOC>

 - I again thank the member for his question. There were 606 submissions received by the inquiry. They were all looked at closely. Some were positive; some were negative. Both positive and negative submissions were quoted extensively in the report. So much for it being the whitewash you have alleged here today. It is a very balanced report.  The submissions have influenced the 39 recommendations, as have the inquiries - 41 meetings with stakeholders. There are a number of important recommendations which the government will respond to. We will consider them carefully and give a comprehensive reply. The report has only been in the government's hands a few days. It is an inquiry the opposition never wanted, never supported - in fact, actively opposed. - In regard to any Wodonga situation, I am sure the member for Indi would be more than ready in her typically competent style to take up any specific issues that may affect anything within her electorate. But remember the report's conclusion, which is this:The inquiry is confident that arrangements that have been put in place over the past five years, including the response to the Besley inquiry, together with commercial developments and the inquiry's further recommendations will create an environment into the future where regional, rural and remote Australians will be able to benefit fully from advances in telecommunications technology and services.That is what irks you more than anything else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The Patricia Baleen gas processing plant is a $120 million investment in Victoria's future. This plant means more jobs for Victoria. It means more efficient industries in Victoria. It means extending the life of the Bass Strait oil and gas field. It means giving alternative gas supplies to Melbourne. Despite its importance, for more than a month no work has been done on this project, because members of the AMWU and the ETU are refusing to cross a picket line, which is apparently being organised by a union official taking long service leave. It is funny that this picket line somehow appeared the instant the unions discovered that workers at the plant would be on Australian workplace agreements.Last week the Industrial Relations Commission issued a return to work order and disbelieved the union's story that this was somehow a community picket. This is a clear case of ultramilitant unions defying the law. This government supports and upholds the rule of law, and that is why we are now intervening in a Federal Court application to enforce the Industrial Relations Commission's order.This government is supporting freedom under the law. In contrast, the Victorian government is standing around like a useless bystander. Since 1999, Victoria has become the epicentre of industrial militancy in this country. Melbourne is now the strike capital of Australia. Victoria now accounts for about 40 per cent of all days lost through strikes, and it is no wonder, because the AMWU controls the largest single block vote inside the Victorian Labor Party - and it is the union Premier Bracks chose to join. - That is right, Mr Speaker. This federal government is acting to uphold freedom under the law while the Victorian government, in contrast, is acting like a helpless bystander. As a result of the strike epidemic now afflicting Victoria, when Japanese investors think of Victoria they think of just two things: koalas and strikes - and thank God for the koalas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is amazing, isn't it, that, having blackguarded the entire Estens inquiry and all those who comprised it, the opposition will now, in a very opportunistic and quite obvious way, seize on those parts they want to make political capital of. We have already said, as did the Estens inquiry, that there were complaints made to the inquiry. That is why we established it - to get the true picture. And we have got the true picture. We have got the positives, we have got the negatives and we have got a balanced report, which the government will now consider in detail.It is fascinating that a member of the Labor Party would ask a question about the mobile phone network, given that you were to close down the analog network, with no replacement. The Labor Party made the decision in the early 1990s to close the analog network and leave rural subscribers without any substitute, except GSM, which of course would have been inaccessible for a great many of them. So there is an air of hypocrisy in any question from the opposition on the mobile phone network.It is also a coincidence, is it not, Mr Speaker, that the member for Cunningham has been admitted today? On this side of the House, we extend our warm congratulations on your stunning success. The major issue for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in that by-election was telecommunications. The disallowance of Telstra's price controls, the Leader of the Opposition said, would be a centre point of the Labor Party's campaign. He was rebuffed on that. He was rebuffed at the last federal election when he said, `This election will be a referendum on the sale of Telstra.' He said that on 2 November 2001. We take the Estens inquiry extremely seriously, as do people of an open and fair mind - and that includes regional subscribers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question on this important day. The stories of our veterans are a priceless part of our history, and the government is committed to ensure that there is a permanent and visual record of their memories. I am pleased to announce on this Remembrance Day that the government is taking action to save for posterity the records and memories of our veterans by commissioning an Australians at War archive, which will be one of the largest in the world - a film archive of veterans' memories. In the last six months a pilot study has been undertaken by the production team responsible for the successful ABC story Australians at War. This screened last year as part of the government's gift to the nation on its Centenary of Federation. Work on the Australians at War archive will commence next month with plans to record and transcribe 2,000 interviews with Australian veterans who served in any of the conflicts, including the First World War and the Second World War, of the first centenary of our nation. The project is expected to take some 2½ years to complete and the final product will be an archive of over 20,000 hours of veteran interviews. It will be the largest archive of its kind in the world and it will be of great interest to families, historians and researchers. When technology allows, it will also be available to schools and the general public. This will be a real step in ensuring that future generations will never forget the service of our Australian veterans and that they have played a significant part in the building of our nation. Indeed, on this Remembrance Day, it is a very significant gift demonstrating the government's commitment to our veterans.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is determined to address very comprehensively and supportively the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, but we do need some time, if you will allow us, to put together such a comprehensive report. We are of course -  - I see. You say we could have done it completely over the weekend. I can assure you that work has started with great speed. As soon as possible, a response to the Estens inquiry will be forwarded. But I should say that the government, as the Estens inquiry has recognised, has done a great deal in the past few years - to the extent that, since 1996, we have spent $1 billion to improve communications and information technology infrastructure around Australia, including especially in regional Australia. We have implemented a whole range of consumer safeguards. We have strengthened the universal service obligation. We have introduced a customer service guarantee in a way that the Labor Party never did in 13 years and undoubtedly would not do. In regard to the mobile phone network, we have established the CDMA network, which extended Labor's to-be-abolished analog network by 50 per cent. We have introduced mobile phone coverage, along -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Along 10,000 kilometres of Australia's highway, there are many things we could list. Turning now to the issue of speed of the Internet: all Australians have access upon request to a guaranteed 64 kilobytes and digital data service, with the four per cent of remote Australians who do not have access to ISDN receiving a subsidised one-way satellite service under a special scheme. In summary, the opposition would do well to work with the government to provide even better and improved services across the length and breadth of the nation. We are serious and determined to do so. We have allowed two inquiries now to identify where the gaps exist so that the government can act and respond. We have done so in regard to the Besley inquiry; we will do so in regard to the Estens inquiry. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Obviously our trade with East Asia is very important for the electorate of Dawson, and particularly for the sugar industry. I do not think there has been any other government in Australia's history that has been more proactively engaged with East Asia in terms of developing trade and economic agreements within the region - no other government in Australia's history.Just by way of example, members would have noted - and the opposition spokesman, the member for Rankin, provided some support a week or so ago - that we announced the conclusion of the free trade agreement between Australia and Singapore. We have concluded that negotiation. We are in the process of negotiating a closer economic relationship with Thailand. We have concluded the agreement with the ASEAN countries - between Australia and New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries. We are in discussion with Japan and Korea about trade and economic agreements. And we are negotiating an economic framework agreement with China. Let us not forget some of the results of the work that this government has done in terms of our engagement with East Asia. I instance the announcement of the $25 billion LNG deal with China in recent months as a result of the work that our government has done. Of course, that engagement with East Asia is all aimed at improving and strengthening economic linkages between Australia and the East Asian economies that are so important to the Australian economy in terms of trade and investment. As I indicated, only last week we concluded the negotiations with Singapore on the free trade agreement between Australia and Singapore, the first such agreement that we have concluded in 20 years, since we concluded the CER agreement with New Zealand. It is interesting that we have colleagues from New Zealand in the gallery today. Twenty years ago next year, the Australia and New Zealand CER was concluded. It took this government to get back onto the bilateral stage to negotiate with Singapore, and I would point out that all those bilateral negotiations are taking place with East Asia. We know the position of the opposition. They are opposed to our proposal, our ambitions with the United States. But I would point out that it is the one and only bilateral pursuit we are undertaking outside of East Asia. Of course, we believe Australia has an ability, and we certainly have a policy perspective, to multilaterally, regionally and bilaterally pursue an improvement in our trade and economic agenda. The Labor Party would have us narrowly focus on the multilateral arena only. We believe we can undertake all those pursuits at the same time. We are proving that we can achieve that. We have concluded that negotiation with Singapore, we are engaged with Thailand, we are engaged with other countries in North Asia, and at the same time we are leading the way in terms of moving the multilateral agenda along. This is what our government is about - not just leading the way in Australia in terms of developing the economic base and our economic integration in the region but also leading the way internationally in terms of opening up markets across the world for trade and investment.Of course we are engaged with East Asia. I will give you an indication of the capacity of those engagements. Australia has a trade relationship with Japan of $44 billion; Korea, $15 billion; China, $19 billion; Singapore, $13 billion; Taiwan, $9 billion; Indonesia, $8.7 billion; Malaysia, $8 billion; and Thailand, $6 billion. Just remember: since 1996, our government has led the way with a 50 per cent expansion - an increase - in the level of exports out of Australia from $99 billion to $154 billion, with a lot of it going into these East Asian economies. When criticism comes from some quarters, like the Australian Labor Party, the majority of Australians know that it is without base and that our government is delivering in terms of our engagement with East Asia. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Do you mean it will leave town faster than the 250 post offices you closed during your term in government? I know the Leader of the Opposition previewed in a doorstop this morning that Telstra would be the issue of the week, but the government is to consider the recommendations and the conclusions of the Estens inquiry. It is something of a broken record to select one part of the Estens inquiry over another to try to score a political point. What the government has done for several years, but particularly following the Besley inquiry, is to inject new funding into the telecommunications structure throughout regional Australia. As a representative of a rural constituency I can attest to the fact that services, maintenance and repair and installations are at a much higher level than ever before and are quite unrecognisable as the Telstra or Telecom of the Labor government years.Enormous progress has already been made, as the Estens inquiry concludes, but there is still a way to go. The government would never be complacent or reliant upon what has already been done. We will always drive improvement in telecommunications services, with particular emphasis on regional Australia. We will consider the Estens inquiry. We will not be baited into making policy on the run. That is something of the province of the Leader of the Opposition. Over the last few years the government have very comprehensively and thoroughly responded to complaints and issues as they arise. We are proud of our record on telecommunications services in regional Australia. We will build on that record and never take it for granted. The Estens inquiry is a very positive step forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and for his ongoing and keen interest in the provision of health and aged care, particularly in South Australia. Last week I was in Adelaide, along with the Chairman of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency, to present an award to Julia Farr Services in Fullerton, which is in the honourable member for Adelaide's electorate. Julia Farr Services is the first aged care residential facility in Australia to receive a new commendable award. This award carries with it a four-year accreditation, an additional year's accreditation above what has been available in the past, and it is to recognise the very best aged care services in the country. It was a tribute to the work of the board, the staff and the volunteers at Julia Farr Services to receive this award. Indeed, Julia Farr Services has been in operation in Adelaide for 123 years. It specialises in the care of elderly Australians, particularly those who have physical, neurological and brain injury disabilities. Currently, as part of the services, Julia Farr operates 70 high-care beds; indeed, it receives subsidies from the Commonwealth of well over $2 million per year. It was therefore disappointing that the very next day I learned that the state government in South Australia and the minister responsible had decided, secretly, to close down the aged care home at Julia Farr Services and, effectively, to take 70 high-care beds out of the aged care system in South Australia.  - The Prime Minister asked rhetorically why. That is a good question for the minister in South Australia. She was reported as saying that the board of Julia Farr had decided, but a letter dated 19 July from the Department of Human Services in South Australia which has been made available to us directs the board of Julia Farr to cease to be an aged care provider. I say to members of the House that this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that the South Australian government is effectively taking up to 70 aged care places out of the system in South Australia. It is unacceptable that an amount of up to $4 million will be lost to the aged care sector on an annual recurrent basis in South Australia. In the last three years the Commonwealth government has allocated more than 2,800 extra aged care places to South Australia, worth some $49 million in annual recurrent funding. I call upon the South Australian government - I call upon Premier Rann and Ms Key, the minister - to reverse what is a cold, uncaring and senseless decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Issues of access and equity are paramount to the government, and it is for that reason that we have already injected $1 billion into improving telecommunications and telecommunications networks throughout regional Australia. We have never said it is picture perfect; we have said that it has been incredibly upgraded since Labor left it in tatters and neglected, and that we still have a way to go. But we will respond properly and with thought, not just with the superficial examination or reading that the opposition has obviously undertaken of the Estens inquiry.But no amount of repetitious questioning will disguise the fact that the Labor Party has internal difficulties on this issue - and on a few others, at that. The member for Melbourne has written in a paper that the current ownership issue of Telstra is unsustainable. The member for Fraser has said publicly that ownership is not the issue, so he joins the New South Wales Premier in that regard. You then have the opportunist Leader of the Opposition, who will seize on any aspect of any part of telecommunications to try to make a political point. The government will come to the issue carefully and in a considered way, and will have full and proper regard for country people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his interest in Work for the Dole. Only last month I announced 337 new Work for the Dole programs, building better communities and opportunities around Australia. Eighty-six of those projects were in the home state of the member for Wannon, in Victoria, helping some 1,149 job seekers. Since the inception of the Work for the Dole program there have been 2,884 projects right throughout Victoria, helping communities, building better communities, building infrastructure and assisting Australia's unemployed. But the government is always looking for new and innovative ways in which to build better and stronger communities and also to build on the success which is Work for the Dole. To that end, a Work for the Dole nationally significant project was commenced in Melbourne and in Perth. It was building on our postwar immigration records, detailing these with the National Archives, entering the information into a data package and repackaging it so it would be available not in its original form - which is going to deteriorate over time, so we would lose a very significant part of Australian history - but in a data format so that it would be available eventually to all Australians. There has been a cooperative approach between my department and the Archives, and we are now about to extend the program in Victoria so that post-World War II records will now be put onto the database and made available. That will increase the Work for the Dole program by 20 places and it will do something very significant for Australia's heritage.I am asked about comments. There have not been too many negative comments from the opposition of late, but one has to wonder whether or not the comments that have been made in the past by Victorians such as the member for Batman - where he referred to the program as `somewhat of a flop' - still stand today, or whether perhaps he is starting to re-evaluate his thoughts on the program. I direct the member for Batman to -  - They always spark up when we talk about Work for the Dole. It comes down to this: whether or not they support -  - I wonder whether some of the members on the opposition front bench understand the importance of this project or whether perhaps they are like the member for Batman. He perhaps should go and visit Ballarat and ask the eight participants in Ballarat about the young people who are -  -  - Well, the member for Batman often goes there. Perhaps I could invite the member for Batman -  - The excitable member for Batman perhaps would like to go and visit the Black Hill Primary School. We are out there preparing teaching aids and displays, assisting with reading, assisting Australia's young people - there is worthwhile work being undertaken by unemployed Victorians with Work for the Dole. Perhaps he would like to visit the City of Bendigo, where retail training opportunities, the sorting of goods, the storing of displays and pricing items are some of the worthwhile activities being undertaken with the Salvation Army there. Not going too far from home, he could even visit Moreland in his own electorate of Batman, where he could determine once and for all whether or not this is a worthwhile program. Electors in the electorate of Batman are participating in organising to collect and recycle educational material to be redistributed to more needy people in the Cook Islands. Perhaps it is time that the member for Batman appreciated the worth of Work for the Dole and how it is working - as the member for Wannon and other Victorian members on this side know - for Victoria's unemployed. It is clear to everybody in this House that the member for Rankin was correct when he said that the electorate is left wondering what it is the Labor Party stands for. This side of the House certainly does not know what you stand for and neither do the unemployed in this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, but the same question will elicit much the same response - that is, the government are deadly serious, as our record shows, about improving telecommunications services throughout Australia, including in regional and rural areas, across the board; all aspects of it - so that people do have fair and proper access to the network. I should say in regard to health that one of the government's responses to the Besley inquiry was a $50 million national communications fund to give people in regional areas access to remote health and distance education services. That is something the member for Throsby has not taken into account, but we will take into account all aspects of the Estens inquiry because the commitment to improve regional telecommunications services has dominated this government from 1996 onwards, after 13 years of studied and deliberate neglect by the Labor government. We will very responsibly and sympathetically reply to the Estens inquiry.</DOC>

 - As some would have read in the media, the bushfires throughout Australia this year are of great seriousness and are causing very major damage as we speak. In fact, some 3,000 volunteer and professional firefighters are fighting 102 fires in New South Wales alone, and there are significant fires in the Gold Coast hinterland and on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Already, some 36 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales alone. A major contributor to the protection of homes was best identified in an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald which refers to Southern Highlands historian Marie Chalker, who was luckier than some others mentioned. The article states:All that saved her Aylmerton home was a last-minute dousing by a heli-tanker. `I just said a prayer and then Elvis appeared and emptied its load,' she said.The fact that those particular helicopters were there and are so effective at saving people's homes in what is professionally called the forest-urban interface is very much due to the contribution and initiative of the Howard government. An inquiry recommended that some of these aircraft be imported. It was found that, with the very early commencement of the fire season, they needed to be airfreighted in, and they were. Not only did the Howard government make an original offer to meet half the sea freight and leasing costs to have this equipment in Australia; we were quick to offer 50 per cent of the airfreight costs as well. These particular aircraft are now making a great contribution - in fact, they commenced work on 17 October and one of the first areas where they set about protecting people's property was in the Blue Mountains, in part of the member for Macquarie's electorate. He of course is very conscious of the benefits this is bringing to his constituents.  All that said, we should not for a moment ignore the contribution of the men and women and their terrestrial equipment that is at the very front of these fires; in fact, they are the people who must do their best. There are issues relating to that which must be addressed in the future. There has been a clear inadequacy in roads for those people to get in and address these fires, and that is one of the reasons why we need more aerial assets. But the fact of life is that there also has to be proper forest management. In fact, as was put to the select committee of the New South Wales parliament, the National Parks and Wildlife Service had reduced their hazard reduction by 60 per cent over seven years and as a result lost 750,000 hectares of their forest reserves to fire, compared to the 2,000 hectares which was all that was lost in state forests where appropriate hazard reduction of about 100,000 hectares a year had been practised continuously. So these are pretty important issues.Those on the other side of the House have also said a lot about the Commonwealth's role. There have been all sorts of suggestions and questions to the Deputy Prime Minister. It was of some interest to me, therefore, that on 22 October the Queensland Premier had the following to say, as recorded in Hansard on page 3828:Queensland has been participating in a project to develop a national aerial firefighting strategy. The project commenced as a result of concerns arising from the New South Wales bushfires in late 2001 and early 2002. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, wrote to the New South Wales Premier offering assistance to coordinate the development of a joint proposal amongst the states and territories on cost-effective options for improving Australia's aerial firefighting capacity.Now, that is not an example of offers, as has been reported, to buy four helicopters and do other sorts of things. In fact, it identifies that the Commonwealth took a leading role.In response to that, we were challenged on the last day of sitting in the previous session with, `Why don't we have a summit?' That challenge of course came from the opposition. They have had a lot of summits: there was the economic summit, there was the tax summit and there was the ALP rules summit, and they all had no effect. I thought I could identify some of the speakers that might be present. We could have the member for Werriwa tell us how effective a coastguard might be in putting out coastal fires; he says it will fix everything else. The member for Rankin could give a speech on how, under the Kyoto principles, you could sell all those charcoal credits after the fires. The member for Fremantle could tell us about the importance of recollections in getting yourself out of a fire.</DOC>

 - Prior to lunch the member for Fraser made a number of false allegations again, including the one he has just put to me. I am told by the Minister for Finance and Administration  that under the finance minister's orders dated 24 May 2001 the requirement for 2001-02 is that all administered revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows be disclosed by way of note rather than on the face of the statements. There is no diminution in the detail of information disclosed and foreign exchange gains and losses are explicitly required to be reported in the note: appendix A of the FMO for 2001-02.I am further instructed that the finance minister's orders were disallowable instruments and they were gazetted on 27 June 2001 without any demur from the Labor Party. Here was the big hot scoop before lunch. That is what Senator Minchin tells me. - In addition to that, a number of other -  - A number of the other false claims were made by the member for Fraser shortly before lunch. I cannot deal with all of his falsity but I will deal with some of his most egregious ones. The report of the Australian Office of Financial Management as at 30 June 2002 reported on page 20 that the appreciation in the exchange rate over 2001-02 led to a foreign currency gain of $1.2 billion.  - I am coming that. If he can only restrain himself, I am coming to that! The then shadow Treasurer showed great interest as at 30 June 2001 on valuation effects, but he shows no interest in valuation effects in this year's report, which was tabled Friday week ago. It is all there on page 20:As at 30 June 2002, the realised gain on the total portfolio was $144.3 million ... and $777.4 million (in net present value terms).That is the realised gain. It is all there on page 20. He was fishing around on page 160 looking for Senator Minchin's alleged perfidy. Then it says: On a broader economic return basis, this takes into account both accruals and cash and exchange rate and interest differentials. The economic performance of the strategy since it commenced in 1987-88 - which is 15 years ago - was a loss of $898 million ...Which is about $45 million over the course of 15 years. While they were busily thumbing their way on page 160, they apparently forgot to read the summary which set it all out. While I have got the opportunity - I was afraid I would not be asked a question on this today - when the member for Fraser is asked is he against the strategy of cross-currency swaps, he says there is nothing inherently wrong with it - and he nods again. He has to say that, doesn't he, because it is a Labor Party policy? There is nothing inherently wrong with it. When he is asked whether the government is doing the right thing by winding it up, he says he cannot disagree with that. It is his policy and we are doing the right thing to wind it up. So what is his complaint? When he is actually pushed on what his complaint is, he says, `The Australian government should have sold Australian dollars at the time of the Asian financial crisis. You should have wound down your cross-currency swaps which involve selling Australian dollars in 1997.' That is what he said. I will make a few points about this. The first is that it is great to be an expert on the 1997 exchange rate in 2002; that is easy. But if we searched the record in 1997 did we find anybody in the Labor Party advocating getting out of the Australian dollar? Did they advocate it in 1998? Did they advocate it in 1999? No, they advocated it in 2002 - a sort of a Back to the Future, where somebody goes to the future and gets the race results and comes back in time and decides to bet on winners. That is the first point.Did the Labor Party advocate it in 1997, 1998 and 1999 or thereafter? No. Did the Treasury secretary advocate it? No. Did the Reserve Bank governor advocate it? No. - Did I advocate it? No, I did not. Let me tell you why I did not advocate it: in 1997, when the Australian dollar was falling and when Labor debt had peaked at something like $US9 billion, what would have been the effect of the Australian government selling its own currency in the midst of a financial crisis? Let me ask this other rhetorical question: what would the price have been - not the published price looking back now - if the Australian government had dumped its own currency? It certainly would not have been the advertised price of that day. At the time when the Asian financial crisis was on, no-one in their right mind would have advocated that. In fact, the Reserve Bank of Australia was actually buying the currency in 1997, if the truth be known. That has all been put on the record since. So to expect the Australian government to be selling currency to its own Reserve Bank in 1997 really does take one's breath away. If that is the level of the 2002 analysis, all I can say is: the Leader of the Opposition is very safe in his current job.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Dunkley, a great advocate for the 8,000 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Dunkley knows, as do all the members in the Liberal and National parties, that over-regulation prevents small businesses from making money. The Liberal and National parties want small business to make money; they want small business to be profitable. If a small business person is spending time dealing with regulation and they are not selling to their customers, they are not making money. One of the biggest causes of red tape is the overlap between Commonwealth, state and local government.This is quite an astounding figure: the Office of Small Business advises me that the Commonwealth requires approximately 250 licenses and permits - in this parliament, we are aware that those licenses and permits would be things like TV licences, broadcasting licences, banking licences and so on - there are 3,000 required by the states and there are 20,000 required by local government. - That could get us into some trouble, couldn't it? - I see. Any attempt to reduce the regulatory overlap is obviously welcome. Victoria took a major step forward in 1996 when under the Liberal and National government they referred power on workplace relations from the states to the Commonwealth so that a single system would apply, and 275,000 small businesses welcomed this initiative and it was great news for more than half a million Victorian employees. However, there is a disappointment to come. On 12 September this year, Steve Bracks introduced a bill to the Victorian parliament that would go back to the bad old days. It meant that there could be three levels of regulation for small business workplace relations instead of one. So Victoria under Steve Bracks want to go back to three levels of regulation in workplace relations instead of the single level they have at the moment. As an example, under this bill a Victorian business could reintroduce awards to a number of industries where they have not applied for years.So what does that mean? It means that effectively, for example, the old picnic days come into play as a result of the initiative of the Bracks government. The Australian Retailers Association estimates that the additional cost and compliance burden of this Bracks government initiative would cost Victoria 2,500 retail jobs. It estimates that 20 per cent of businesses would cease Sunday trading and a third of businesses would reduce Sunday trading. It is even worse in rural and regional Victoria. The Victorian Farmers Federation estimate that 10,000 rural jobs would be lost as a result of this Bracks industrial relations legislation. And this is during the worst drought in regional Australia in 100 years.On the one hand you have the Bracks Labor Party, which wants more regulation for small business and wants to create more impediments to the employment of people in Victoria and, on the other hand - as displayed by what they did in government - you have the Liberal Party, who are committed to reducing the red tape burden and who are committed to a single system of industrial relations applying to Victorian businesses. The Victorian Liberals are committed to getting on with the job, something that the Bracks Labor government has not done for three years. </DOC>

 - The resolution passed by the Security Council is, as I said yesterday, a very welcome resolution. It certainly requires a reporting back to the Security Council - there is no argument about that. On the question of whether it is explicit on the question of `unilateral action' - to use the language of the Leader of the Opposition - I do not find that language.Could I make the point that I thought an observation made by the shadow minister for foreign affairs at the weekend was a very good point and I agreed with him. I do not always agree with the shadow minister, but on this occasion I did. He was invited to agree with the statement made in New York by the immediate past shadow minister for foreign affairs and he declined to do so. He made the observation that things could change and there should be, to use his language, a final level of constraint so far as current policy was concerned. I think that is a very sensible remark. I thought he spoke good sense. I thought he was rather more judicious in what he said than either the Leader of the Opposition this morning or the immediate past shadow foreign minister earlier.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate the interest he shows in Australia's relations with Asia, including in this particular case North Asia. There is no doubt now, I am sure, that our relationships with the countries of North Asia, particularly with Japan and China, have, frankly, never been better. That was illustrated by my recent visit to Japan as well as to China.When I was in Japan I had the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Koizumi as well as the foreign minister, the defence minister, the cabinet secretary and others. During my discussions with Mr Koizumi, we discussed, in particular, the issue of terrorism, terrorism in East Asia and the implications of that for the region. I made the point to Prime Minister Koizumi that I thought it would be appropriate if Australia and Japan were to cooperate to a greater extent than we already do in trying to assist the countries of South-East Asia to deal with the problem of terrorism. I suggested to him that Australia send a delegation of officials to Japan to sit down with Japanese officials to look at what both our countries are doing to assist the region with counterterrorism and to see whether there is not more we could do either separately or together to enhance those capabilities. This proposal was warmly embraced by Prime Minister Koizumi, and those officials will be off to Japan before too long.We also spent a good deal of time talking about the question of North Korea. Like Iraq, this is a country which has a weapons of mass destruction capability, which is of immense concern to this government. This government has always been very concerned about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Australia and Japan will work very closely together, as we will also with the Republic of Korea - South Korea - and the United States to ensure that there is an appropriate and united response to dealing with the problem of, particularly, the uranium enrichment program in North Korea, which is in clear breach of the 1994 agreed framework.Finally, the honourable member asks also about China. I have just spent two days in Shanghai. Australia is the first country ever to participate in the Shanghai International Arts Festival as a feature country. This week is the Celebrate Australia week in Shanghai. A large number of Australian artists will be performing this week. Shanghai is a city of 16½ million people, with an enormously high rate of economic growth. With Australian artists having such a high profile, that will not only do a great deal to promote the arts and culture of this country, which are unique and exciting, but will also do a great deal to enhance Australia's already strong reputation in China. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his quite unexpected question. More of the same today - you are pretty desperate. We have this broken record - that you will seize on one aspect of the Estens report. The opposition will delve into the minutia of the Estens report and try to find one complaint or another. There were 606 submissions to the Estens inquiry. We invited them. We urged constituents to make submissions to the inquiry so that we would have a full and honest appraisal of the system as it presently operates and how we can improve it. So, of course, it is not surprising that issues of difficulty or problems were highlighted for the Estens inquiry - as we wanted them to be. - But, of course, we could also have put forward for the education of the House all of the positive, supportive submissions. The Estens report came down with 39 recommendations which the government is going to very seriously consider in the near future.With regard to broadband - of all the issues to seize on - I hardly think an opposition member should highlight any broadband issues, given the neglect in your time in office. Of the billion dollars we have spent on improving the telecommunications network, both urban and rural, in the last few years -  - broadband has been defined as a particular priority. We have provided $50 million under the National Communications Fund to support the extension of broadband services to improve the delivery of education and health services across many communities. The Broadband Content Fund, worth $2.1 million, provides seed funding for innovative content producers to develop new broadband applications. The Launceston broadband project, to take an example, is a pilot project to test consumer interest in the development of broadband content applications. Under the Advanced Networks Program, $37 million has been allocated to three advanced network and test bed projects to encourage experimentation in and commercialisation of leading edge technology and products. We have spent $150 million on the extended zones agreement, meaning two-way satellite services are being offered to consumers in many remote parts of Australia on very favourable terms and conditions.The Estens report recognises the growing priority being placed on broadband services and proposes a set of principles to guide the government into the future in relation to meeting this growing demand. Overall, the Estens report assessment is that the government has responded positively and comprehensively to the findings of the telecommunications service inquiry findings and arrangements have been put in place to identify those concerns and issues arising out of the Besley report. Whether it be broadband, Internet services, mobile phones, repair or installation, the Estens inquiry finds a very marked and considerable improvement on the part of Telstra and that the government's huge injection of funding has assisted this improvement. The government will continue to improve our telecommunications services. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. The National Australia Bank today released its business survey for October - importantly, it was the first of the surveys post the Bali bombing - which takes into account confidence effects and the like on business. Although business confidence was down a little from 14.9 on the index to 11.5 in October, business confidence remains quite robust. In fact, the National Australia Bank comments that it is consistent with the non-farm GDP growing by around four per cent. Business profitability increased by three points. Forward orders were up and capacity utilisation remains at high levels. The National Australia Bank comments that it would be misleading to downplay the continuing robustness of domestic economic conditions.The government will be updating its forecasts with its mid-year review on 27 November and will be taking into account those changes in the economy since the May budget. I indicated yesterday that the severity of the drought is expected to knock up to one per cent off the GDP, but the non-farm GDP continues to remain quite strong. In addition to that, the international environment has deteriorated, although we welcome of course the cut in official interest rates in the United States late last week. The fact that the official interest rate now stands at 1¼ per cent, which in real terms could well be a negative interest rate, indicates the dangers that the authorities in the United States now see in relation to that economy. Coupled with that is continuing deflation in Japan and weakness in Europe.Notwithstanding those international factors, the Australian economy continues to be one of the strongest performing economies in the world. The labour market results for last week showed that employment continues to grow, although the employment forecast has now actually exceeded the forecasts that we made in relation to this year's budget. There still remain budget measures outstanding which the Labor Party refuses to pass. These are measures which will put on a sustainable basis some of the fast growing demand driven programs in our budget and cope with ageing and structural changes in relation to our population. The changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are probably the most important of these measures, and they build on what the Labor Party itself believed was necessary when it was in office and when it had leadership that believed in economic responsibility. Those measures will be reintroduced into the House of Representatives as soon as possible. We call on the Australian Labor Party to reverse its position and get some responsibility; to really confront some of the issues which Australia will have to confront in the future in relation to the ageing of the population; and, for once, to try to do the right thing by Australians and the right thing by Australia's economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is very hypocritical of the opposition to refer to individual submissions in the Estens inquiry about dial-up Internet speeds when there has been such marked improvement since 1996, when we came to government. In 1996 there was no digital data service obligation ensuring access to ISDN. There were no guaranteed Internet dial-up speeds or any programs to improve those speeds. In more remote areas the Internet was simply inaccessible due to the reliance on old radio concentrator systems. That is what we inherited: an ageing, out-of-date system. As a direct result of our unprecedented injection of funding we have improved dial-up Internet speeds, and the drastic improvement is very obvious.We tabled a booklet today, through Senator Alston, entitled Australian Telecommunications 2002. It has been released across the length and breadth of the nation, and all Australians can dial up at least one ISP at untimed call rates. This has been done both through Networking the Nation's Internet access fund, which has funded Internet points of presence, and through commercial solutions. In remote areas of Australia we have spent $150 million so as to provide all customers with untimed local access to an ISP. We have funded over 1,600 public Internet access facilities in regional Australia. Prices have fallen with over 600 ISPs operating in a highly competitive environment, and there is a large range of plans being offered by ISPs across Australia. We are also funding, jointly with Telstra, the Internet assistance program, which is ensuring that all Australians outside the extended zones have access to a dial-up Internet speed of at least 19.2 kilobytes per second. The extended zones have a special arrangement, including through the provision of a subsidised two-way satellite.So the government has done a great deal on Internet speed as well as access, and the opposition look frail and incompetent when they keep seizing on some submissions to the Estens inquiry. I do not know how often we have to say it: we have never said that it is a perfect world in either urban or regional Australia. We have done a great deal to bring up the level of services across the board. The opposition did nothing during its 13 years; it should be supporting the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I know that he has always been a strong supporter of our agenda to liberalise the markets of the world as far as agricultural trade is concerned. Specifically, in the area of citrus, some of the markets that we have managed to open up are in North Asia and in the United States, as well as the wine industry and the dairy industry in his electorate.At a time when a lot of Australia is experiencing one of the worst droughts that we have had for many decades and we are nationally focusing our attentions on ensuring that the farm community makes it through this devastating drought - and quite rightly so - we also need to not slacken our focus on opening up new markets across the world and getting improved access across the world for our agricultural exports. Long has it been Australia's key trade objective in terms of the multilateral system and bilateral negotiations to improve market access, particularly for agricultural commodities. It is also a critical element of ensuring that the developing countries of the world get access to the developed markets of the world, improve their economic circumstances and improve the overall global economy. Australia has always been at the forefront of pursuing agricultural trade liberalisation. We forced agriculture to the top of the agenda last year when we launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations through the WTO. Australia, in its capacity as the chair and the leader of the Cairns Group, made sure that a very strong mandate came out of Doha for agricultural trade liberalisation. We have clearly enunciated our position in the rounds so far. Opening up market access, eliminating trade-distorting domestic support and phasing out, with a view to eliminating, all export subsidies in the trade of agricultural commodities - they remain our core objectives in the WTO round.Our strategy goes beyond our leadership role in the Cairns Group to developing a network of like-minded countries that share our view on agricultural trade liberalisation - countries like Egypt, Kenya, Uganda and the United States of America. Incidentally, the tabling of the US proposal was a positive step, following the passage of the Farm Bill earlier this year which absolutely challenges other heavy subsidisers of agriculture to reform at the same pace and time as the United States is prepared to. We encourage and support that and have done so through a number of fora in recent months.We successfully chaired the meeting of the Cairns Group in Bolivia only a couple of weeks ago, where that group called for WTO members to keep the promise that they made in the Doha mandate to liberalise agricultural trade multilaterally. The communique from the successful leaders meeting that the Prime Minister attended in Los Cabos in Mexico called for the elimination of export subsidies for agricultural commodities, a move that was also supported by Japan. This week we will chair the informal ministerial meeting in Sydney where Australia will play a lead role in the overall WTO agenda as far as the development and the advancement of agricultural trade liberalisation are concerned. That is significantly important for Australia.While we need to focus on the desperate circumstances of Australia's farmers during the current drought, we should not lose focus on the ultimate goal of improving global market circumstances for their future benefit, once we move through to the other side of the drought. Australia is leading the way on agricultural trade liberalisation, and our government remains committed to that agenda.</DOC>

 - I am always happy to take questions on the budget, Mr Speaker. I will be even happier to take a question on the economy from the member for Fraser when one comes one day. In relation to the Telstra sale, the government, in accordance with usual practice once it makes a decision, puts the financial effect of that decision in its budget papers. That has always been the case, just as the budget papers include the savings from the changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Included in the budget will be the savings in relation to debt retirement, any costs in relation to the sale and any other financials which arise from it. The costs in relation to financial sales are the best estimates of the department of finance at the time, but all the financials will be fully and clearly put down in the budget papers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am very pleased that, after some pretty intensive negotiations, Virgin Blue Airlines and Sydney Airport Corporation have reached agreement on the former Ansett terminal - T2, as it is known - at Sydney, and that will see Virgin moving into the facility from early December this year. Virgin will take six gates on a priority basis, with access to up to another six common user gates. In doing so, it will join the four other airlines that are already operating from T2, namely, Regional Express - or Rex, as they have become known - Qantas Link, Horizon and Aeropelican. Most of the ex-Ansett terminals have been sold to the airport operators and are now back in use with the very important provision for common user access. That is important; we do want to make certain that any new entrants to the Australian aviation sector are not denied reasonable and fully competitive frameworks. I think this is a good outcome. It will benefit the travelling public in the lead-up to Christmas; they will enjoy, obviously, access to larger and more modern facilities as well as more ready access to the relevant airlines, including Virgin.It has to be said that Virgin Blue has grown to be quite a force in the Australian domestic aviation market; over recent times they have come to operate some twenty-eight 737 aircraft. I welcome CEO Brett Godfrey's comments at the Australian Airports Association national convention in Adelaide yesterday, when he said that further expansion is now planned, which will see jet services extended to new regional destinations. That is something that many people, particularly those with an interest in tourism, will certainly welcome and look forward to.There is no doubt that the last 12 months have been difficult for aviation right across the globe. In reality, our market has probably survived in better shape than almost any other around the world, but we have been busy. We have reformed airport pricing arrangements; we have liberalised international airline access to Australia's key regional gateways; we have encouraged and supported the successful relaunch of Ansett's regional subsidiaries; we have stepped in to keep airlines flying after the September 11 tragedy, through the provision of a government indemnity for aviation war risk insurance; we have exempted regional airlines from en route air traffic control charges; and we have endorsed and progressed a plan for low-level airspace reform.It is time that we got on with this in Australia. There have been several attempts over the last decade; this time we have it within our grasp, with the support of all the major players, including the Royal Australian Air Force - which is very welcome indeed. We are moving to simplify our arrangements and to harmonise them with what will be known as the North American airspace arrangements, and we have announced a review of federal government taxes and charges levied on the regional aviation sector. This is in addition to my announcement yesterday that we would review the Airports Act. Coupled with announcements to come shortly about further streamlining of CASA's arrangement - following the receipt by the government at the end of July of the report by CASA's chairman, Ted Anson, on future government arrangements - that points to a lot of activity in the aviation sector. It is an important part of the Australian economy in its own right, but it is terribly important to our business, to our commuter sectors and also to our tourism, both domestic and international.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. It is nice to have a question that brings one to the dispatch box. Firstly, in answer to the last part of his question concerning whether the sale of Telstra will be - what was it? - `terrible' for regional Australia or some such word, no, it will not. As a result of T2, this government was able to actually increase services in rural and regional Australia, which would not have otherwise been done. The thing that we on this side do not accept is the assumption held by the Australian Labor Party that the government can always provide services better than the private sector can. Anybody who has dealt with government knows that government does not always deliver services better than the private sector. If government did so, then why would the Australian Labor Party have privatised the Commonwealth Bank? If government is better at banking, why didn't you keep a nationalised bank? If government is better at air travel, why did you privatise Qantas? The `born again nationaliser' who sat through all of the privatisations when Labor was last in government conceded that principle.The proposition that the government brings to bear is obviously that there are some services which the private sector can provide and the private sector ought to provide them. In relation to the Telstra sale, we have three principles. Firstly, there will be no further sale of Telstra until services in rural and regional Australia are up to scratch. That is why the Esten inquiry was done. - Secondly, obviously there will be no further sale of Telstra shares until such time as the parliament passes legislation to that effect. Thirdly, if legislation to that effect were passed, then the government would take a decision on the best time and mode of sale. That does not mean that the government would sell the day after legislation had passed. Obviously it would take time before Telstra was in a position to have those additional shares offered to the market. As the Prime Minister said on the 7.30 Report, we would obviously take price into account so that it offers - if that should occur - at a time which maximises shareholder value. - No, I said there were three conditions: rural and regional services, passing of legislation, and then taking into account value. - If the member for Melbourne would stop interjecting, he might hear something. He might start listening. In relation to Telstra, I indicate that obviously the Telstra price goes up and it goes down. - Mostly down, he says. Let me give the member for Melbourne something to think about. When T2 was floated off, it was $7.80, and the Labor Party opposed the offering of additional shares. - Correct. The financial effect of opposing that sale was, between T2 and T3, the loss of $30 billion on the share price. The reason why we have a lot of interest in all of this is that the Labor Party loves its interest in valuation. The difference between the proceeds as they would have been at the time Labor stopped further sale at the time of T2 and today is $30 billion.  - `Rubbish,' says the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, I ask him to go out and I will produce the calculation of the share price and the number of shares. Since the Labor Party get very interested in value, they might like to just think about that fall and the effect of $30 billion in relation to those share prices. There are three conditions: rural and regional services, the passing of legislation, commercial decision. We believe that, subject to rural and regional services, the private sector can provide telecommunications. It does it in the United States; it does it in Britain; it does it in New Zealand. It manages to do it in Europe. It does it in North Korea and it does it in Cuba. I do not know if the member for Melbourne secretly admires them or not, but the private sector can actually provide telecommunication services.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and I acknowledge her ongoing care and support for the families involved in this tragedy. The Westralia fire in May 1998 was one of Australia's worst peacetime tragedies in recent years. The fire claimed the lives of four sailors, while others suffered a range of physical and mental injuries. The government is sensitive to the impact of this tragedy on the shipmates and their families and has provided counselling, medical and compassionate care services. Additionally, ready access has been made available through a comprehensive range of benefits and support under the Military Compensation Scheme, which is one of the most generous compensation schemes in Australia. While I do not intend to comment on individual cases, I can advise the House that the government has already made over $1 million in compensation payments in respect of the Westralia fire, and in many cases ongoing incapacity payments will continue over a claimant's lifetime.The Western Australian coroner has announced that he will conduct an inquiry into the tragedy, although the form of the inquiry has not yet been determined. I am pleased to advise the House that the government will provide legal and other assistance to the families of those who died in the fire so that they may be represented at that inquiry. I am currently considering the form and the amount of that assistance and will be in a position to advise the families very soon.I am also aware of requests for Commonwealth assistance by former sailors pursuing a civil action against defence contractors in the District Court of Western Australia. These requests raise a number of complex issues, and they will be sensitively considered in accordance with the relevant legislation. I hope to be in a position to make an appropriate response very soon.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At the risk of restating what has been said several times today, not least of all by the Treasurer, the government will not introduce legislation with respect to the further sale of Telstra shares until it is satisfied that arrangements are in place to bring regional and rural services up to scratch. The sale of the remaining shares in Telstra - at least of the Commonwealth shareholding - is dependent on passage through the parliament, and then further sale is dependent on the situation in regard to the market - world equity markets and the like. They are the three preconditions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and I note her concern to ensure that rural industries flourish, particularly in her own electorate. The Saizeriya development at Melton in Victoria should be the start of a $400 million investment in Victorian jobs. It should be a billion-dollar lifeline to Victorian farmers at the time of the worst drought in 100 years. Instead it has become almost a case study in how unions can be taken over by anarchists and standover men masquerading as workers.I regret to inform the House that the Saizeriya project is 25 per cent over budget and 12 months behind schedule because of bloody-minded conduct by ultramilitant trade unions. Officials of the AMWU and the CFMEU have repeatedly breached orders of the Industrial Relations Commission, they have repeatedly ignored injunctions from the Federal Court, they have repeatedly broken their own solemn undertakings and they have repeatedly boasted that they are above the law - and why wouldn't they boast that way, given that they own and operate the Victorian government?When this project was just three months behind schedule, the Victorian government intervened to instruct the company to appoint a particular industrial relations consultant. This consultant turned out to be such an industrial relations genius that he organised a $17,000 worker barbecue on the same day that a concrete pour was scheduled. Even Victorian Treasurer, John Brumby, knows that this project has been a disaster for Victoria's reputation. He says:Everyone in Victoria wants this project to succeed. The only group not hearing the message is a particular element of the AMWU.But there is a problem because the No. 1 ticket holder of the AMWU is none other than Victorian Premier Steve Bracks, who specifically singled out this union to join. Just as the Saizeriya dispute was plumbing the depths, AMWU member Steve Bracks appointed AMWU member Craig Johnson to the Victorian Manufacturing Industry Council. So there is a clear message coming out of this: when Labor is in office, unions are in power. If people do not want the AMWU ruining the Victorian economy, they cannot keep Steve Bracks running the Victorian government.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I would remind him that the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator actually falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Health and Ageing, so it would be more appropriate for the question to be directed to the health minister. However, from an agricultural perspective, I can report to the House that these issues were discussed at the last meeting of agriculture ministers in Sydney. Considerable discussion is occurring in rural communities about the merits of, particularly, the introduction of genetically modified canola to Australia, and that discussion has been heightened as a result of the applications that are currently before the office.There are a number of communities where there is opposition to the use of genetically modified canola. On the other hand, there are other significant parts of the industry that support the introduction of this new technology and report favourably on the economic benefits to farmers in other parts of the world where these new varieties are available. The minister has decided to set up a working group to look at some of the agronomic and segregation issues associated with alternative technologies. You will be aware that for some time now, probably a year to a year and a half, my department has been conducting a major audit and study on the question of segregation. That project is proceeding well, in cooperation with the handling authorities around Australia.So there are a number of complex issues; it is appropriate that the community should consider those on their merits. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator will certainly take into account implications for the environment, the health and safety of the Australian people and other related issues before coming to a conclusion on whether genetically modified canola should be released in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. He is concerned about jobs, he is concerned about investment and he is concerned about his electorate. The $12 million Seal Rocks development has always been seen as a major potential boost to Phillip Island and Victorian tourism. - The development was initiated by the previous Liberal government. However, when Steve Bracks came to government its future immediately became bleak. The Bracks government constantly ran interference on the project. They wanted to get involved in issues like operating hours, entry fees and charges, and other day-to-day management issues. They also opposed the second stage of development, which would have created more jobs and generated more investment on Phillip Island. The previously indicated support for reconstruction of the jetty and other basic related infrastructure was not delivered by the Bracks government. So the operators were hamstrung by state government red tape and ignorance. Even from the advice of the independent adviser to the Bracks government, alarm bells were being rung in the corridors of the state's executive arm of government and nothing was being done.In short, as this significant tourism project welcomed its 175,000th visitor in just 12 months, the Bracks government was ignoring the pleas of the operators and its own adviser, the Bracks government's own adviser, to do something about the project. The net result was that an independent arbitrator was appointed to resolve the differences and the independent arbitrator came down with a decision that the Bracks government -   - had to compensate the operators of this development to the tune of $60 million. That is $60 million of Victorian taxpayers' money because the Bracks Labor government ran constant interference in a private sector project. And it did it in partnership with the Independent member Susan Davies, who was constantly opposing this development.According to a state parliamentary inquiry, the Bracks Labor government deliberately colluded to make the Seal Rocks centre insolvent. There are serious allegations the Labor government colluded with Susan Davies - and I quote - `in a premeditated and corrupt act'. Confidential documents which were revealed in the Age newspaper -  - Documents obtained by the Age revealed that the Bracks Labor government was aware that it was responsible for the issues and needed to fix the problem. However, it wanted to put it to the side. This is hard to believe: a document of advice to Premier Steve Bracks prepared by the Victorian cabinet office, and supported by the Department of Treasury and Finance in Victoria, said on 7 April 2000:It is possible for the government to do nothing, to argue that Seal Rocks knew what it was getting into and the government should not bail it out.So here you have a bureaucracy advising a government to do nothing. Maybe it is because it is the other way around: you have a government in Victoria that has done nothing and that sort of attitude pervades the attitude of the bureaucracy. The Phillip Island community has lost jobs because of this initiative being jettisoned by the Bracks government. The Phillip Island community has lost valuable tourism dollars. This says a lot about a weak, leaderless government in Victoria that is not prepared to put the jobs and the dollars of the local community ahead of its own mates in the union movement.</DOC>

 - Let me say first of all that in this matter the government continues to follow the policy of the Labor government, which over 13 years did not introduce formal price monitoring of bank fees. - The government, of course, continues the policy of the Australian Labor government which over 13 years did not introduce formal price monitoring on banks. - In fact, the last promise that was made by the Labor Party on the matter -  - was made on 26 February 1996 and the election, as I recall, was on 2 March 1996. - We remember well that promise that came out, which was that if they got elected for a 14th or a 15th or a 16th year they might look at the issue again. Having said that, I think that banks really need no defence from me. Banks are very profitable institutions which can explain to their consumers why they price their products as they do and banks have people who are paid salaries much higher than mine whose job it is to explain it, and they can explain it.I think on this side of the parliament we would say that banks have the obligation to give their customers the very best service, and where they do not do that we support new competition which can undercut the banks and give better services. The new competition that has occurred under our government - which was not allowed by Labor - was building societies gaining access to the cheque system, the introduction of community banks, which is a new development under the coalition which is undercutting the banks, and full retail competition.We would say two other things about banks. The first is that today you get much lower interest rates from banks. We do not say that is because the banks have done anything good; that is because of good economic policy. Let me make this point: if you had a choice of paying a bank fee or a 17 per cent home mortgage interest rate, I would frankly take a six per cent home mortgage interest rate rather than what was the case under the Australian Labor Party. All of the evidence is that under the Australian Labor Party banks recovered a lot of money through increased margins. It was the compression of the margins under this government that put the acid on those banks. - I am minded to make this second point because the Leader of the Opposition said, `Have you taken the fees down?' The answer is yes. This government abolished financial institutions duty. He interjects very loudly, but did the Australian Labor Party ever abolish financial institutions duty? Did the Australian Labor Party support the tax changes that took $1 billion off financial institutions duty? Does the Australian Labor Party -  - In completion, this government abolished over $1 billion of bank fees when it abolished the financial institutions duty and this government also has a plan for the abolition of the bank account debits tax, which is another billion dollars. So as far as the government is concerned, in total I think it is $2.5 billion to $3 billion of government taxes on banks - which, on every credit and every debit, banks passed on to the consumer - are being taken off. This is the government which reduced government tax in relation to bank fees. This is the government which reformed the tax system. The Australian Labor Party opposed those measures because it opposed tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur. I visited his electorate recently and met with some wonderful participants doing some very good work. Local governments right across Australia are undertaking successful Work for the Dole programs. In fact, there have been about 1,300 participants throughout the state of Victoria working with local governments on Work for the Dole programs - in the La Trobe shire with the member for McMillan, in the city of Ballarat, in the Mornington Peninsula with the member for Dunkley and the member for Flinders, and in New South Wales in the member for Parramatta's electorate, which we visited not so long ago and where we met with some sponsors out there.Despite federal ALP's resistance to Work for the Dole, it is interesting to note that a number of Labor councils are actually throwing their support behind these worthy programs and doing something for their local areas. In Campbelltown, the local mayor out there - I believe he has recently been elected - Mr Brenton Banfield, Mayor Banfield, is showing great support to a Liberal member of parliament. They are working together to do something positive. Similar things are happening in Blacktown, where the members for Chifley and Greenway have constituencies; in Fairfield, where the members for Fowler, Prospect and Reid have constituencies; and in Liverpool, where of course we know the member for Werriwa is a supporter of Work for the Dole. - We know the member for Fowler is not a supporter of Work for the Dole.Despite this growing support for Work for the Dole at the grassroots level, there are still some councils who want to run a mile and want to say one thing to the constituents but do something totally different. The member for Lowe had this to say about Work for the Dole:The only future young people can look forward to is Work for the Dole. Window-dressing by renaming it as Work for the Future or any other euphemism will not repair its badly tarnished reputation as a failed scheme.But in his own backyard there are closet Work for the Dole supporters. Recently in a series of newsletters, media releases and on the Web the mayors of Strathfield and Burwood councils heralded a joint new positive initiative to bust graffiti throughout their shires in the electorate of Lowe. But guess what? It was not the councils doing this; it was not council money. In fact, it was Work for the Dole programs.In this Burwood Council newsletter, there is an article about the graffiti solution program taking off. Have a listen to this for a quote:We are kicking off with a six-month partnership with Strathfield Council to remove existing graffiti in both municipalities, and then to wipe out new graffiti within 72 hours of its appearance.There is not one mention of the hard work of unemployed people making a commitment through Work for the Dole and supported by the Howard government. Not only that but the Mayor of Strathfield, Mayor Virginia Judge, is not just the Mayor of Strathfield; she is the endorsed Labor candidate for the seat of Strathfield. So here we have a Labor mayor, a Labor candidate in a Labor seat, supporting Work for the Dole but having no guts to stand up and say, `Thank you and well done,' to the hardworking people in their own electorates participating in Work for the Dole. It is no wonder the member for Rankin wonders what the Labor Party stands for. We have Labor candidates, we have Labor mayors, we have Labor federal members supporting it. It is only that this mob here are so confused and so gutless that they will not actually say what they mean. They use these people and abuse these people - how about supporting them and congratulating them? - If he is referring to the Hansard, as promised, I am happy to table it. The rest are private notes.  - These are confidential notes. The Hansard will stand for the member for Lowe. - Mr Speaker, I table -  - Finally, I table the Burwood Council's press release. The comments regarding the Hansard report are also tabled.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the Queensland government lodged an application for exceptional circumstances declaration for Peak Downs Shire and parts of the Belyando and Emerald shires a week or two ago. This particular application was actually prepared largely by AgForce, the farmers' own organisation in that region, because the Queensland government has not taken much interest in providing drought assistance, and so it was left to the industry organisation to do most of the work. But eventually the application was presented. The government announced on 19 September that we would speed up the consideration of applications by allowing predictive modelling to be used to bring forward the time at which applications can be considered, and also that we will make welfare payments available as soon as a prima facie case has been established. But it was on two conditions: firstly, that the state had to have declared the area to be in drought before the application was made; and, secondly, that they had made a significant effort to provide assistance to the farmers in the region.This particular application covers the Peak Downs Shire and parts of Emerald and Belyando shires. The Queensland government has not declared either Emerald or Belyando shires to be in drought. So they are lodging an application for the Commonwealth to pour in potentially millions of dollars to assist farmers in an area that they do not even consider to be in drought. I have asked the Queensland government for some information on how much money they have provided to the farmers in this region, including Peak Downs. The state governments are very reluctant to tell us anything about the efforts that they are talking about, but we do expect the states to have made a reasonable contribution towards helping the farmers in the area. As the honourable member said in his question, there are about 220 farmers in the region. So what would honourable members think would be a reasonable amount for the Queensland government to have given to these farmers before they asked the Commonwealth for assistance? Would it be two or three million dollars? Perhaps that would be a reasonable effort. But in this particular case they have not given $2 million; they have not even given $1 million. They have given a total of $12,000 among 220 farmers. We in the Commonwealth are anxious to do what we can to help farmers in need. Exceptional circumstances has always been a `last call' assistance. The states are normally expected to have made something of an effort themselves before they call on the federal taxpayers for assistance. This is a clear case of a state government trying to shift the total responsibility onto the Commonwealth - doing nothing itself and asking the Commonwealth to declare areas to be in exceptional circumstances where it has not even declared them to be worthy of its own drought declaration. The Commonwealth are concerned about these farmers and we do not want Queensland farmers to have to suffer because their own government is not prepared to provide them with any assistance. It is high time that the Queensland government provided these farmers with support. We are prepared to consider the application in spite of the dismal performance of the Queensland government, but it obviously detracts from its submission when it is not prepared to provide any assistance to these farmers itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. This government believes that putting Australia on a sustainable basis is only going to occur when we involve the community in key environmental projects. One of the great achievements of the Natural Heritage Trust, which is now allocating some $2.7 billion dollars to the greatest environmental rescue effort in Australia's history, has been the direct involvement of over 400,000 volunteers who have put their time and energy into environmental projects.For the second phase of the trust, the Australian government Envirofund has been established to maintain and build on that momentum by providing funding to local groups and harnessing their local knowledge, their expertise and their enthusiasm to deliver on-ground results. Last Friday I announced some $20 million in grants to local groups for some 1,300 projects around Australia. These grants are aimed at building the capacity of local groups in environmental care. I am pleased to inform the House that some 42 per cent of these groups were receiving grants for the first time. What we are seeing is a building momentum in the community to address environmental issues.As a result of these grants, the Malpas Catchment Group in New England will be able to revegetate a 10-kilometre native vegetation corridor, the Aldgate Valley Landcare Group will be able to create a wildlife corridor in urban fringe bushland in the Adelaide Hills, the Bunya Community Association will be restoring degraded areas along the South Pine River in the member for Dickson's own electorate and in Queensland a group will address declining marine turtle numbers through monitoring and education programs.One of the great features of the Envirofund is that it leverages a great deal of resources from the community itself. This $20 million from the Natural Heritage Trust is estimated to be leveraging an additional $34 million from the groups involved. This shows what can be done when you begin to empower the community. I noted with some satisfaction this morning that the Liberal Party in Victoria has released its environmental policy promising to `empower Victorians to be involved in their local environments and to ensure a whole of government, whole of community, triple bottom line approach to a sustainable future in Victoria'.It is very good to see the commitment of the Victorian Liberal Party to sustainability and the concept of a sustainable environment and sustainable industry. This is a dramatic contrast with the Bracks government, which has rejected the policy of sustainable forestry in Victoria, has torn up the Victorian Regional Forest Agreement, has rejected the science of the matter and has capitulated to political lobby groups in a shallow attempt to buy votes. The Bracks government says it will preserve the environment, but it says it will preserve it by locking out the community and completely doing away with the principle of sustainability, which should underlie any proper environmental policy. Our view is that the community lives in the environment and it can do so on a sustainable basis. It is not appropriate environmental policy to say that the community has nothing to do with protecting and preserving the environment or using resources on a sustainable basis. The contrast between these approaches is very clear in the comment of a forestry union organiser in Gippsland quoted in the Australian this morning who said:The modern Labor Party has betrayed its roots, and is prepared to sell the jobs of timber workers, paper workers, furniture manufacturers and anyone else if they think they might steal a few votes.Labor has rejected environmental sustain-ability as a goal and replaced it with cheap opportunism.</DOC>

 - First of all, I have never ruled it in. I noticed the other day in a transcript which was sent to me while I was overseas -  -  - You would not have clue, frankly - that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs had claimed that I had been out there campaigning for renewed links between Kopassus and the SAS. As I pointed out on ABC Radio the other day - let us just get this clear - that was the Labor Party's policy when they were in government until we scrapped that policy in 1998.A government member - That is right. That was the Keating policy. - That was the Keating government's policy. Let us just get that absolutely right. The Prime Minister was asked this on the 7.30 Report last night, I think, and he made it perfectly clear that we have made no decision to reinstitute training between the SAS and Kopassus or links with Kopassus. That is not a decision that the government have made. We have talked on many occasions about a process of gradually rebuilding our links with TNI in a way that is appropriate and significant to our interests.  - We have made no decision to renew links with Kopassus. This is the point that I am making: links with Kopassus was the Labor Party's policy. We have not made any decision. - Obviously, what we do with Indonesia is build links, as best we can, where we think it will advance our own national interests. We will look at opportunities to expand relations with many aspects of Indonesian society where we think that is going to make a constructive contribution not only to the Australia-Indonesia relationship but, above all, to our own national interests. But we have not made any decision to expand links or to reintroduce links with Kopassus.It always strikes me as quite odd - certainly in recent times - that on the one hand the Labor Party have this line they try to get up, claiming that the Australian government does not put enough energy and enough effort into the relationship with Indonesia but, on the other hand, they say it is an outrage that the Australian government is looking at building relationships with TNI or with Kopassus. They make claims that we are building relations with Indonesia too strongly on the one hand, but that we are doing too little on the other. That sums up the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition.  - There were two parts to the question. - I would indeed like to answer the first part of his question, having answered the second part. - No. - The answer to the first part of the question is that there certainly are indications that elements of TNI may have had links with Laskar Jihad - there is no question about that. Whether those elements would have been particular units of Kopassus, or whatever those elements may have been, is another matter. The honourable member quotes some academic research to that effect, but there have been a number of reports that have suggested that there may be links between Laskar Jihad and elements of the TNI - that is well known. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question, for his advocacy, in particular, for James Cook University in Townsville and for achieving $480,000 for the university for its genomics education centre. This is a university which, I might add, had removed from it last year $4 million in payroll tax by the Beattie Labor government in Queensland.The review of Australian higher education is now completed. It has been extremely successful. Almost 800 submissions were received to the review, including from five state Labor governments, the National Tertiary Education Union and even the National Union of Students. The priorities for the government in relation to universities are diversity, quality, equity and, of course, sustainability. As the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University said in the Australian newspaper on 28 August this year:The Australian higher education system needs a thorough overhaul. Without it our universities will remain trapped in a regulatory system that makes it unnecessarily difficult for them to attract, retain and reward world-class scholars, teachers and researchers.That precisely is the point for this government in addressing adversities. Whether it is drought or improving Australia's security further, this government is thinking about Australia's future and the role that universities will play in creating that future.I am asked about other policies. The Australian Labor Party had the opportunity to contribute to this review and there was not one single contribution made by them to the review of Australia's universities. In fact, the member Jagajaga has racked up in excess of $1.2 billion in promises in saying all kinds of things to people throughout the country. One might easily ask: what does the Australian Labor Party stand for in relation to universities? For example, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee unanimously recommended in part limited deregulation of fees: some fees might go down and some fees might go up - all of them supported by government loans. This is an idea promoted by the member for Werriwa, in The Enabling State, in his wordy tome. He said that universities should be encouraged to specialise. He said that under Labor one group would be for those `internationally focused universities reliant on deregulated fees and private revenue sources'. The member for Jagajaga told the ABC on 10 October this year - before the review was even completed - `We are actually trying to stop it before it happens.' So before the Labor Party know what is actually going to happen, they are talking about trying to oppose it. We then need to ask the Labor Party what it stands for in relation to domestic fee paying students. There are 6,000 Australian students who currently pay a fee to get a university education in Australia. The Labor Party has said that it does not want to see this happen, that $70 million would be lost to Australian universities but, worse still, a student in Tokyo or Beijing would have greater access to Australian universities than would a student living in the suburbs or the regions of Australia. The other point that ought to be made is that the Labor Party has opposed some of the suggestions that came out of the review; for example, that we should offer a HECS loan to those 5,100 students who go from TAFE to university and get credit for their TAFE course. That was one of the suggestions. The member for Jagajaga was totally opposing it before the print was even dry, and then the member for Melbourne came in here on 15 October and said:I would like to see the HECS system ... opened up for income contingent assistance with respect to students who are undertaking vocational education and training.I think the member for Rankin got it right on 8 November in the Australian when he said of the Labor Party:In trying to be all things to all people, Labor runs the grave risk of being nothing to anyone.In the end, this is about Australia's future. What happens with university policy over the next two years will determine what will happen in this country for the next 20 and, in particular, what will happen for the people of Far North Queensland and James Cook University.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer is no, of course. - The copayment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was introduced by the Labor Party. It was introduced on the grounds that the Labor Party said then - and it was right - that it was important to have a copayment to make this a sustainable scheme. It was supported by the coalition. That good policy could never have occurred had it not been for the support of the coalition. The cost of medicines, obviously, is much greater than $3.60 or $4.60. If the cost of medicine is $100, $200 or $1,000, a pensioner will still be entitled to buy it for $4.60. What is more, after 52 scripts - that is one a week - it is free. So the $1 increase can amount to no more than a cost of $52 per annum. From memory - I will check this later on - the average number of scripts in a year is something like 19. So for the average person the cost will be something like $19.This government has indexed pensions to the male total average weekly earnings, so that pensions are rising faster than the consumer price index. They are rising in line with wages, which are outpacing the consumer price index. Pensioners are protected against prices and the value is actually increasing. This is a fair proposal. It is a proposal which, when the Labor Party had some leadership, it used to support. It is a proposal which the Labor Party now seeks to oppose out of cheapjack opportunism. The government is putting in place the changes which will make this a sustainable system, and those that care about having a sustainable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be voting for that budget proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. Of course my attention has been drawn to the broadcast, allegedly of a tape recording of a statement made by Osama bin Laden. At present, the authenticity of the tape is being checked both here and in the United States, to our knowledge, and perhaps elsewhere. When the government has some formal advice in relation to that, the government will have something further to say on the matter. I would at this stage, however, make two comments. The first of those is that at no stage has the government ruled out - in fact many of us have expressed the view that it is more than likely - that al-Qaeda was behind or associated with the atrocity that has occurred in Bali. If in fact further evidence emerges of that, it will not be of any particular surprise. The other observation I would simply make to the House - and it is a remark made generically and not necessarily with specific reference to today's report - is that I am quite sure that I speak for all Australians in saying that we will not be intimidated in relation to the policies we pursue by threats from terrorists.</DOC>

 - If the honourable member had listened to my last answer, he would know that was not the case because, as I said in relation to the last answer, the maximum contribution increase is $1. After 52 scripts in a year they are free and, from memory, the average number of scripts is about 19. Not every pensioner has 52 scripts a year. - I believe the average is 19. I will have that checked during the course of question time, but that is the figure which sticks in my mind. If the honourable member wants to say that $4.60 is somehow going to mean that people do not fill their scripts, why did he support $3.60? - Why did he support $3.60? Why did the Labor Party introduce the copayment in the first place if it now claims that a copayment means people will not take medicine? This is where opportunism catches up with itself. The Labor Party introduced the copayment -   - on the grounds that, in relation to very expensive scripts, whether they cost $100 or $200 or $1,000 or $2,000, a copayment would defray some of the cost and would make it affordable to bring new scripts onto the scheme as they became available. If we do not put this on a sustainable basis then we will not have the capacity - as we want to do - to bring the high-tech, expensive scripts onto the system at the concessional rate. That was precisely the argument that was made by the Labor Party when it introduced the copayment.They have never said since that they are against a copayment. If they were, they would presumably want to abolish the $3.60. All they say is that they are against the increase to $4.60 - not from any principle, not from any real respect for making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme sustainable and not because they have read the Intergenerational Report for, if they had, they would know that the Intergenerational Report shows that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is the fastest growing area of Commonwealth expenditure. It is cheapjack opportunism. It is the kind of opportunism we saw in the last parliament with the famous roll-back policy. When it is defeated, they will walk away from it as they walked away from roll-back, and in the interim the government will get on with the business of making health care sustainable in a financing sense.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I appreciate the interest he shows in this important issue. As the honourable member points out, the Iraqi parliament last night voted unanimously against Security Council resolution 1441, which requires Iraq to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction. But honourable members on both sides will be pleased to hear that the Iraqi parliament is not really like the Australian parliament. All of the candidates for election to the Iraqi parliament are hand-picked from the Ba'ath Socialist Party - some of course are hand-picked for our own socialist party in this parliament, I know - or else, if they are not members of the Ba'ath Socialist Party, they are regime loyalists. But the point is that all candidates for the Iraqi parliament are vetted by Saddam Hussein's interior ministry to ensure their loyalty to his regime.The serious point here is that any decision on compliance with Security Council resolution 1441 is going to be made by Saddam Hussein and his regime, not by the Iraqi parliament. But the international community has, through resolution 1441, demonstrated a very clear resolve to ensure that Saddam Hussein does disarm, and a maximum amount of pressure is now being placed on him to do so. By Friday, Saddam Hussein must confirm he will comply with the resolution. Twenty three days later, he has to declare in full Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear programs, military and civilian, and its missile program, and he must allow inspectors to go anywhere, anytime without exception.Let me make this point that the threat of force against Saddam Hussein over the last few months has been effective in getting him to announce, as he did during I think September, that he would allow weapons inspectors in on an unconditional basis. It is regrettable that dictators, such as Saddam Hussein, only understand the language of force, but he did at that time understand the language of force. Saddam Hussein knows that the international community demands that he rid himself of weapons of mass destruction. He must accept that proposition, and we hope that that can be done through United Nations processes. But the debate about the possible triggers for military action will only take place, of course, if Saddam Hussein decides in the end to walk away from compliance with the United Nations Security Council resolution. The resolution says any material breach by Iraq of its terms will be reported to the Security Council but, contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition said at his doorstop interview this morning, it does not provide for a second resolution. It is not assumed or understood that that will automatically happen.  - Resolution 1441 does not preclude the use of force by the United States or anyone else and it does not set out exactly how the council should set up material breaches. I would commend the resolution to the Leader of the Opposition. I would make a suggestion that he sit down and actually read it. In Australia, we will be watching Iraq closely. The international community will be watching Iraq closely, particularly as we draw to the end of this week. The important thing is that the international community must show strength and resolve in confronting Saddam Hussein to ensure that he eliminates his weapons of mass destruction. We hope he will do that consistent with Security Council resolution 1441 and not have to face other consequences.</DOC>

I can tell the honourable member for Fraser - I assume he is trying to insinuate something improper - that I did not seek advice from Mr Adler nor from Mr Turnbull. - Mr Speaker, I am faced with the difficulty of answering the question from the member for Fraser when, as I answer it, the member for Hotham comes in with a new one and, not to be upstaged, the member for Werriwa comes in with one of his own. If we can line them up, I will start with the member for Fraser first. -  - I assume he is trying to insinuate something improper, so I will put his mind at rest: I did not seek advice from Mr Adler nor from Mr Turnbull. The advice I would seek in relation to solvency would be from the regulator which has been set up to deal with solvency, which is APRA. I acted in accordance with APRA's advice at all times, as you would expect a Treasurer to do and as a Treasurer would be obliged to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would like to set out considerable detail in relation to this matter. The House will be interested to hear it, I am sure. Under the agreement which governs the appointments to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Commonwealth is responsible for making a recommendation to the Governor-General. That can be made only if it is supported by a majority of the states and territories. Under the code which governs the way in which these recommendations are to be made, if the Commonwealth proposes filling a vacancy, it must notify the states. The states then have the opportunity to make recommendations. The Commonwealth is not obliged to accept any of those recommendations, but the Commonwealth can then put forward a name to the states and territories for them to vote on in a period of 35 days, and only if there is a majority may it put that name forward to the Governor-General. If a majority of states want to veto an appointment, they have the right to do so in the 35-day period. This was the procedure which was followed in relation to the deputy chairman. The Commonwealth notified that it would be filling a vacancy and called for recommendations from the states. Some recommendations were received. New South Wales at no stage recommended Dr Tom Parry, whom I have seen referred to in the press. At one stage, they recommended a woman but, as recently as this week, they confirmed to me that they were not seeking the appointment of that woman. After considering all of these matters, and particularly in the light of the fact that Professor Fels indicated that he wished to wind up his appointment earlier than expected, the Commonwealth put forward a name for consultation with the states, and it was Mr Graeme Samuel. Mr Graeme Samuel, I believe, has been one of Australia's foremost experts in relation to competition. He was voted into that position under a similar procedure, with support from New South Wales. Professor Fels was very strong in recommending Graeme Samuel as the deputy chairman, and Victoria and Tasmania - two Labor states - voted for Mr Graeme Samuel. I pay tribute to the Tasmanian government, because I think they have been very responsible in relation to this. - And Mr Bracks. I pay tribute to the Victorian government for their vote in relation to Mr Graeme Samuel. Opposition to this matter has been led by New South Wales. New South Wales, as I said earlier, handled negotiations in relation to this matter through its Premier, Mr Bob Carr - it always has. When the vacancy was opened, I wrote to Mr Carr. When no nomination was forthcoming and I wrote back with the nomination of Professor Fels as chairman, I again asked Mr Carr for a nomination. When a nomination came from New South Wales, it came from the Acting Premier, Mr Refshauge, on behalf of Mr Carr. When the Commonwealth put Mr Samuel's nomination forward, it was sent to Mr Carr. When we received a response, it was from Premier Carr. When I wrote back it was to Premier Carr. When I rang to discuss it last Thursday, it was with Premier Carr. When I rang to discuss it again on Monday, it was with Premier Carr. I want to make that point, because some in the media seem to have assumed that Mr Egan was involved in this process - he was not. Premier Carr was handling negotiations on behalf of New South Wales. The only nomination that was put forward was for a woman, and Mr Carr confirmed to me as recently as Monday that the New South Wales government was not proceeding with that nomination.It is said now, after the event, by Mr Egan, in particular - who was not involved in this matter - that there was some breach of process. The process which was followed was the same process which was used for the appointment of Professor Allan Fels and the same process which was used for the appointment of Jennifer McNeill, Ross Jones, John Martin, Sitesh Bhojani, David Cousins and Rod Shogren. All of those people were appointed under this same process. In fact, New South Wales has no complaint about the process, because there were actually two nominations out there - both Mr Samuel and Ed Willett. They were nominated by the same letter. The vote is proceeding in relation to both of them. If New South Wales were against the process it would vote against both of them, but it has only voted against Mr Samuel, which illustrates that they have no objection to the process. So what then is the objection that the New South Wales government might have to Mr Graeme Samuel, and why would it be running the furphy that it was all to do with process? Fortunately, somebody contacted me this morning and suggested that I log on the web site www.council.labor.net.au, which takes you to the site of the New South Wales Labor Council. You can actually go to minutes of meetings of the New South Wales Labor Council. The New South Wales Labor Council minutes of a meeting on 24 October 2002 show that the chair of the meeting was the President, Comrade Sandra Moait. The meeting was at the Trades Hall Auditorium, Goulburn Street, Sydney. Present was J. Robertson, Secretary; M. Lennon, Assistant Secretary -  -  - `M. Lennon', not `V. Lenin' - and A. Peters. The first item of business was `Receiving executive business correspondence' from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association - and I think I should read this correspondence in full:... expressing their concern regarding reports that the Treasurer, Peter Costello has announced his intention to appoint Graeme Samuel as the heir apparent to Professor Allen Fels, the Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The Union said as Mr Samuel is being appointed to a vacant position on the ACCC, it is expected that when Professor Fels retires in June 2004 that he will be elevated to the position of Chairman of the ACCC. Given Mr Samuel's well known track record of preaching deregulation and, the fact that deregulation in its many guises has often made life worse, not better, for ordinary workers and their families -  -  - They always interject at the critical moments. I ask the House to listen to this. The correspondence continued:the union asked that the Labor Council write to the Premier calling on the State Government to oppose the appointment of Graeme Samuel to the ACCC and that the Premier writes to Treasurer Costello expressing the State Government's opposition to Mr Samuel's appointment within the next 28 days.Comrade J. Robertson then moved the executive's recommendation, which read:That the correspondence be received and that Labor Council write to the Premier to express its concern about the appointment of Mr Graeme Samuel to the ACCC.The union gave Premier Carr 28 days from 24 October to cast his vote against Mr Graeme Samuel. He did not need the full 28 days; he replied on 4 November - within eight days.When I have persistently asked the New South Wales government what its objection is to Mr Samuel and why it voted for him as President of the National Competition Council but voted against him as Deputy Chairman of the ACCC, the answer I have been given is, `There's a lot of opposition around the place.' What I did not realise was that the Labor Council of New South Wales had instructed the New South Wales government on how to cast its vote. I table the minutes of that meeting which are on the web site and I ask anyone who is interested to look up the web site. Should the New South Wales Labor Council have a veto over the appointment of the Deputy Chairman of the ACCC? - `Why not?' said the member for Werriwa. I asked the question, `Should the Labor Council of New South Wales have a veto over the appointment of the Deputy Chairman of the ACCC?', and the member for Werriwa says, `Why not?' I will tell you why not - because under the legislation this is for vote by state governments, who are answerable to the electors of their states and not the faceless men of the New South Wales Labour Council. That is why not. Nobody has elected Comrade J. Robertson to exercise the vote of the New South Wales government. A deputy chairman of the ACCC would not only be enforcing competition law but also sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. That is why Comrade Robertson should not have a veto. On this side of the House, we believe it is the electors that decide governments and their votes, not the faceless men of the Labour Council. </DOC>

 - The government's policy has been long established - that subject to services in rural and regional Australia -  - Subject to services in rural and regional Australia being brought up to scratch, it is government policy to offer the remaining equity in Telstra to Australian shareholders and others. Since that has been the policy for several years, that has always been reflected in the budget - and I have confirmed that over and over again. I recall confirming it during the election campaign. I absolutely confirmed it, so there is no news in that. I have confirmed it over and over again. That is the way in which budget policy operates.The government's position has always been that the proceeds should be used for debt retirement, and that has always been reflected. That is the way in which we have handled our privatisations; where we have sold equity in an asset, we have used the proceeds to retire debt. It is a longstanding policy, and there is a reason for that: when the Labor Party sold assets they spent the proceeds and ran up debt. They sold the house and increased the mortgage. We have never been in favour of doing that and we have always reflected that in the budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. The question reflects his longstanding interests and his position as chairman of the intelligence services committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. It is a serious question. I am very pleased to advise the House that, as the member for Fadden's question implies, today is the inaugural meeting of the new National Counter-Terrorism Committee. It is meeting in Canberra. This committee has been given a clear and broad mandate to protect Australians from the threat of terrorism.Its establishment follows agreement at the leaders summit on counter-terrorism and multijurisdictional crime which was held earlier this year. The summit delivered groundbreaking outcomes in recognising the need for national coordination of certain terrorist situations and a shared commitment to strengthening coordination of Commonwealth and state and territory counter-terrorism capabilities. It was formalised by the recent signing by the Prime Minister and state and territory leaders of the intergovernment agreement on Australia's national counter-terrorism arrangements. One of the key results of the leaders summit was the reconstitution of the Standing Advisory Committee for Commonwealth-State Cooperation for Protection Against Violence -  that is, SAC-PAV - as the National Counter-Terrorism Committee, the NCTC.This new committee has a much broader mandate to cover prevention and consequence management issues. The fact that this committee will have to report to COAG on its progress reflects the importance of the role and the seriousness with which the Commonwealth, state and territory governments approach this issue. The committee will, as a matter of priority, prepare a report for COAG in relation to any additional measures concerning the appropriate upgrade of security measures. Attending the meeting today will be the deputy commissioners from state and territory police services and representatives from state premiers and chief ministers departments as well as the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Defence, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, Emergency Management Australia, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and other relevant agencies.The committee will consider protective security measures for key components of critical infrastructure. Those particular measures will require cooperation between the Commonwealth, states, territories and, in this case, the private sector. It will also review the National Counter-Terrorism Plan and develop a work program to take account of priority work to be done, as agreed by COAG. The work of the NCTC is vital to the security of Australia and its people. It is particularly important following the atrocities of September 11 and the Bali bombings. Australians deserve and expect to feel safe, and the Commonwealth government is committed to doing everything it can to protect Australia, its citizens and its interests against the scourge of terrorism. The NCTC is just one of the many measures the government has put in place to do just that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me make the general point that debt reduction has been a very important part of the government's strategy in recent years. Presumably your focus is to pose the question as to what it might be that we are most committed to delivering to rural and regional Australia, and I have to say that nothing outweighs the benefits of lower interest rates, the tighter economic strategies that we have run and the results of a proper and clean float of the Australian dollar. These are all recognised as having delivered enormous benefits to rural and regional Australia.  Further to that, I would make this very important observation: financial discipline has enabled us to deliver, on budget and without having to borrow, a lot of very valuable programs to rural and regional Australia. There is the $2 billion or so which, one way or another, has gone into the Natural Heritage Trust; there is the money that has gone into Networking the Nation; and there is the Roads to Recovery program. The list is endless. In the context of the very serious drought confronting us, this discipline has enabled us to put things like farm management deposits in place. The contribution to this program - on behalf of the taxpayer -  and the efforts of the government far outweigh anything that any of the state governments have done for drought-affected farmers. Let me just establish this general principle: I am committed to sound financial management because of the benefits it plainly produces for all Australians, including regional Australians. The broad principle of our approach has always been consistent, and the Treasurer has reiterated this. Of course it is a government position, and it has my support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question, because it certainly is a matter of which I am very much aware. This is a matter about which I have spoken quite frequently. I have spoken on this in the House and alerted members to the situation which we have had to deal with over a period of time. The fact is that we have often said that people use the protection system to try to obtain migration outcomes. Boat arrivals provided a way of doing that. Many people were prepared to dispose of any documents, which might have successfully helped in identifying them, before they came to Australia. That presented a much more challenging environment in which my officers in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs have had to operate.If you have any doubt about whether or not this is something that has just afflicted Australia, I would remind members that we heard evidence this morning that, in France, people in Calais are refusing to avail themselves of the French determinations system - which I am sure nobody suggests is in any way inadequate or inappropriate. They are holding out because they think they will get a preferred outcome if they can get to the United Kingdom. As I said, the allegations raised in the Age are not news to me. In fact, it can be seen from the report that I spoke to the reporter and told him what I am about to tell the House, and that is that of course I became aware of suggestions - particularly information from the community - that some of the people who had come through the temporary protection visa system may have been able to deceive us in that process and obtain an outcome inappropriately.When I became aware of those allegations, we sought to investigate them and investigate them fully. We established, as a result of the concern we had about the potential numbers of people involved, specialist units in May 2001 to deal with the issues. Currently, there are around 700 instances of suspected fraud being investigated, where people have been granted temporary protection visas on either false or fraudulent information. We have very clear information that we have received from overseas that has identified a number of people as being nationals of another country. The numbers in the paper were not right. I think they said there have been five cancellations; that has moved now to eight - and I suspect there will be many more as a result of these investigations. But it needs to be remembered that in our system, which has allowed people to obtain visas in the circumstance where the courts have helped us with advice as to what the evidentiary requirements need to be and where matters need to be dealt with on the balance of probabilities, we have seen that the doubt is more likely than not to lead to a grant of protection in many cases.  In relation to the cancellation system, we face the same difficulty. The burden of proof is upon us to show that somebody has obtained a visa fraudulently. Of course, that means we have to provide that information to visa holders and they have to have the opportunity to comment on it. When they have commented on it, we have to look at what they have said, then we have got to make a decision as to whether cancellation should proceed and then we face the possibility of legal proceedings arising out of that. So what we have is a system that makes it very difficult to address these issues. The article made some other claims about which I would like to comment briefly. It said that more than 200 Pakistani nationals have been linked with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. This is primarily a matter for the Attorney but, to my knowledge, there are no known links. I recall that the head of ASIO advised the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in August - and this was the subject of a question by the shadow minister - that his organisation had not issued any adverse security assessments in terms of unauthorised arrivals posing a direct or indirect threat to Australians' security. I made it clear at that time that that did not deal with other character issues, and I do not resile from those comments I made. I have had no advice - and I checked this with the Attorney today, who tells me that there is no advice to him nor advice I have received - to suggest that the information given by the head of ASIO has changed.Let me make it very clear: security is an issue that the government takes very seriously. My department routinely refer identity details of asylum seekers to relevant authorities for checking and, where identity fraud has been seen, the procedures are repeated -  as you would expect, because previous considerations may have been made on the basis of only the information that was available to us initially. I should say that, in relation to these issues, determination is very difficult in relation to people who have disposed of documentation, where you only have what they have to tell you to make your decisions. It is as a result of that that we have undertaken very comprehensive training of staff. We have undertaken language analysis and we have developed a comprehensive and focused set of country information.We also withdrew recently - and this has been the subject of comment elsewhere - the provision of tapes. We withdrew the provision of tapes to people who were being interviewed. The reason that we withdrew those tapes from the hands of the advisers to applicants was that we found that there was information suggesting that those tapes had been used to school people before they came and to advise them on the nature of the questions we were likely to ask - such that people even came asking for specific officers on the basis that they expected to be able to be interviewed by them and perhaps get a more favourable outcome. This is part of the very challenging area in which my departmental officers have been working and, obviously, when we have had advice that suggests that we may have been mistaken in some of the decisions that have been made, we have moved very promptly to put those matters under further scrutiny.</DOC>

 - I cannot comment on those particular examples which have been given, but certainly I think that if you want to follow them up you should insist that the banks themselves give you an explanation in relation to them. I certainly, with you, would be quite interested to hear what the banks have to say about that. You asked me what the government should do. The government looked very carefully at the question of credit cards and we did refer it to the ACCC. The ACCC recommended that we have a Reserve Bank inquiry, which we did under the new powers that had been given to the Reserve Bank. And the Reserve Bank, after doing that inquiry, found that the interchange fees between the banks on credit cards - with Visa, MasterCard and others - were too high and that consumers were being unfairly penalised.The government has announced that it will accept that report in full and implement it. In response to that, I believe Visa is now suing at least the Reserve Bank, and maybe the Commonwealth as well - I am not quite sure - in the courts to try and frustrate the government from introducing that. We will defend that court action, I can assure you, if we are defendants. I have spoken to the Reserve Bank; it will defend that court action, I can assure you. It is an illustration of how you can try and use the legal system to try and delay and obviate necessary reform. One thing we can say on this side of the House, and I hope it is supported from your side of the House, is that putting in place that inquiry and those powers and getting that report and acting on it has been a very positive move in relation to credit cards - in fact, so positive that you have seen the litigation response. But we will not be deterred.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I can inform the House that yesterday Mr Daniel Grollo, who is the joint managing director of one of Australia's most important construction companies, made an important, timely and courageous statement. He pointed out that many of the industry's problems came from a closed shop culture which meant that managers in the industry could talk to their own workers but they were not allowed to actually make agreements with them. He pointed out that, for instance, workers have to be paid from 7 a.m. even though Melbourne City Council rules mean that they cannot actually start until 8 a.m. He pointed out that puddles on concrete have to be vacuum dry, even though workers are issued with special boots and are in fact paid a `wet underfoot allowance'. He pointed out that Sydney Grocon workers can construct a square metre of formwork in just over an hour but Melbourne workers take almost two hours to do the same job. There is nothing wrong with Melbourne workers. There is a lot wrong with Melbourne unions - that is the problem. Daniel Grollo pointed out that the companies have done things to avoid strikes which have cost an enormous amount of money but they have rarely stopped the strikes. It has all got to stop. He said:We will take a strong stand in favour of ethical standards. We won't tolerate standover tactics or coercion and we won't tolerate disregard for the rule of law on our sites.That is a credo that ought to be adopted by everyone connected with the construction industry. I can tell the House that the federal government has established a Construction Industry Task Force with a mandate to secure zero tolerance of illegal practices in this industry. By contrast, the Victorian government has tried to deny federal officials access to sites such as the MCG, even though those officials are there to secure observance of the rule of law. The Victorian government has actually stripped some businesses of their contracts because those businesses had the temerity to do deals with the wrong union. That is the problem with Steve Bracks: we have often seen his smile but we have never seen his backbone. What Premier Bracks needs to explain to the Victorian people is why he is an AMWU member but a CFMEU pushover. </DOC>

 - The question said `given your previous answer'. My previous answer was that the government will strenuously defend legal proceedings which have been brought to try and stop the reduction of interchange fees. In other words, what the government has done is put in place -  - The question was `given your previous answer', in which I said that this government - no other government, no predecessor government - put in place a system by which the Reserve Bank and the Payments System Board could inquire into interchange fees which govern the cost of credit cards. It has come up with a finding which this government intends to implement. Those issuers of cards that do not accept it are taking action in the court to try to stop it. This was a joint ACCC-RBA exercise. We live in a society where there is the rule of law. Under the rule of law, the RBA can be sued; it is being sued. This is an organisation which has a lot of money. The courts will have to determine it. But the one thing we can say is that this government has put in place procedures in relation to interchange fees.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know he is a staunch advocate of industry development in his electorate. I have visited Corangamite and spoken with industry in this electorate, and they have a great admiration for his work. While the federal government continues to create an environment that is conducive to investment and the expansion of industry in Australia, we see in Victoria the opposite. We are seeing investment in industry in Victoria stagnate under the Bracks government. ABS private new capital expenditures data released in June confirms this.  - That data confirmed that new capital investment by Victorian businesses in 2001-02 was down $1.2 billion - 11 per cent lower than when the Bracks government came to power in 1998-99. Those sorts of statistics continue right across the board. If we look at new investment in building and structures in Victoria - and I was very interested in the answer from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations - we see that it has declined by $1.62 billion in 2001-02. Again, that is half what it was when the Bracks government came to power. New capital investment in manufacturing - of great concern to me - was down $253 million, or eight per cent lower than when the Bracks government came to power. That is reminiscent of the lows we saw under the Cain and Kirner governments.Since the Bracks government has come to power, 110 firms have left Victoria, shed staff or decided against investing in that state. All this is happening at a time when the Howard government's sound economic management is continuing to boost investment growth and provide an environment where industry is provided with a solid basis to invest. Over the last six years, we have seen the manufacturing sector in Australia grow in GDP terms by nearly 16 per cent while in Victoria under the Bracks government growth in the sector has fallen to two-thirds of the national average. I was asked by the member for Corangamite whether or not the Victorian government was doing anything to assist in the growth of manufacturing in Victoria. The answer is no - absolutely nothing. It is beholden to the unions in Victoria and their irresponsible actions. There is nothing new about this. We have been aware for a great length of time of the domination of the unions over the Bracks government. We are seeing a situation in Victoria where the control of the unions over the Bracks government is deterring investment and costing jobs in Victoria.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question on education. Firstly, the fact is that the Higher Education Contribution Scheme was introduced by the then Labor government, supported by the Liberal and National parties, in 1988 because the then Labor Party recognised what every fair-thinking Australian understands now, and that is that the Australian taxpayer cannot afford to fully fund a university education for every person in this country who wants it and who is entitled to have it academically and on any social justice criteria.The reality at the moment is that $8.7 billion is owed by 1,115,317 Australians to the Commonwealth government in the form of HECS. At the moment, the students pay 25 per cent of the cost of their university course, and the Australian taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of the university course. The average Australian university graduate leaves university with a $15,000 debt; their average starting salary is $35,000, which is 85 per cent of average weekly earnings; and the average HECS debt in Australia is $7,800. In fact, 91 per cent of Australian university graduates owe less than $16,000 - which is a Mitsubishi three-door Mirage hatchback, drive away, no more to pay. Further to that, a male university graduate in Australia earns, on average, $622,000 more over his lifetime than a non-graduate.  - A female university graduate in Australia earns, on average, $413,000 more over a lifetime than a woman who did not go to university. I was asked by the member for Jagajaga about home ownership. Male university graduates in this country have lifetime unemployment rates of 2½ per cent and female university graduates have rates of 2.6 per cent. As a result of the policies of this government, unemployment in this country at the moment is six per cent. But how many on the opposition side have been unemployed? How many have never had a job? University tests show that two-thirds of Labor Party MPs in this chamber are university graduates, yet the hard work of people who have never seen the inside of a university - for example, the member for Leichhardt, the member for Forde and many on this side - have funded three-quarters of the cost of the university education of people in this country.There is a final point that ought to be made. I am an avid reader; I read many documents. The University of Sydney Union produces an excellent journal called Honi Soit, and I race to my letterbox to get it every time it is delivered. On 16 October it ran a very interesting story - and I know honourable members will be very interested to hear it. The member for Jagajaga had gone to the University of Sydney to meet the students, the students who undoubtedly were outraged at the idea that this government is thinking 20 years ahead for Australian universities. Under the headline `Disappointment all around really', the story -  - Under the headline `Disappointment all around really', the story ran:... the Federal Shadow Minister for Education, Jenny Macklin addressed a forum of students in the Holme Building last Thursday in pursuit of a Labor education `policy'. Macklin, considered by some to be the next Great White Hope of the ALP after she was elevated to Deputy Parliamentary Leader last year, has proved hopelessly disappointing -  - </DOC>

 - I am happy to inform the member for Parkes, and other members who may be interested, that the government has today declared that the Bourke and Brewarrina regions are in exceptional circumstances. As a result of that declaration, farmers in that region will be able to access the full range of business support measures available under exceptional circumstances. Primarily, that involves interest rates subsidies for debts incurred in their businesses and, in particular, in meeting the challenges of the serious drought in that particular region. These farmers have already had access to welfare benefits, backdated to 19 September, and those benefits will continue for a period of two years.I am also happy to inform the House that the federal government has referred the application from the Queensland government for the Peak Downs Shire and parts of the neighbouring Belyando and Emerald shires to the National Rural Advisory Council for assessment. As a result of that decision, welfare payments will be available to the farmers in that region from today for a period of six months while the application is under consideration. In referring to this application, I particularly want to compliment AgForce in Queensland, who put the effort into putting this application together. When the state government was not interested, the farmers' own organisation put in the effort to prepare the information so that it was ready for the state government to deliver to the Commonwealth. It is commendable that the industry organisation has put this effort in on behalf of its members, and I am sure they will be particularly pleased that, as a result of their efforts, benefits will flow to the farmers in that region. Their case was somewhat undermined by the fact that neither the Belyando nor the Emerald shire has been declared by Queensland to actually be in drought. So the state government is asking the Commonwealth to provide exceptional circumstances assistance to an area that they do not even consider to be in drought. We naturally, therefore, cannot provide benefits to the whole of the Emerald and the Belyando shires but we will provide the benefits for those individually drought declared properties in those shires on a basis similar to the farmers in the Peak Downs area.Also, I received this morning from New South Wales three more applications for exceptional circumstances assistance, including one for the western division in the honourable member's electorate. I am told that there will be another couple of applications coming from New South Wales. We will examine those applications promptly to test whether they meet the prima facie case. Naturally we are expecting New South Wales to give us advice about what assistance they have provided to the farmers in this area to demonstrate their commitment to the needs of the producers in that region. Premier Carr said this morning that they provided in the order of $100,000 to some of these areas, which again hardly demonstrates a great depth of commitment when they are asking the federal government to contribute several million dollars by way of support to those areas. Nonetheless, we will consider the applications on their merits and as promptly as we can, and I trust that information supplied will be supportive of the applications presented.I also inform the House that this morning the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the federal government would be providing a $5 million contribution to the Farmhand appeal to boost the effort by the people of Australia to assist farmers facing difficulties and to ensure that there is some assistance available to those who might, for one reason or another, not be able to access the welfare net or who have difficulties for which assistance can be provided. These are clear demonstrations of a government that care about the concerns and the needs of farmers who are facing serious drought. We are determined to do what we can to help. There is much more that the states can do. It needs to be a partnership, but we will certainly ensure that we meet our commitments and our obligations to farmers to help them through these tough times.</DOC>

 - All of the applications that are received, whether they be from New South Wales or other states, will be considered promptly but on their merits. Naturally I cannot give an assurance that an application that I have not even read, or that has not even been presented yet, will be approved the next day. Clearly it will depend on the merits of the case put forward and on a clear demonstration that the state has made a reasonable effort to provide assistance to the farmers in that area and are not just simply attempting to shift the full cost burden onto federal taxpayers. Bear in mind that the Commonwealth taxpayers pay about 95 per cent of the total cost.  - Under the arrangements that have applied for exceptional circumstances for many years now, including arrangements that were negotiated years ago involving all of the Labor state governments and agreed to by them, for a region to be in exceptional circumstances it has to be experiencing abnormal seasonal conditions and well below average incomes for a period of more than a year. Had that criteria been applied to the Bourke and Brewarrina applications, they could not have been approved until well into next year. We have made significant changes to speed up that process -  without any cooperation, I might add, from the Labor state governments. We have agreed to use predictive modelling to bring forward the consideration of those applications. That has enabled the Bourke and Brewarrina applications to be processed and benefits to be provided now and to be announced several months earlier than would otherwise have been the case. We have also moved to provide welfare benefits during the consideration period - something that has never been done in the past, something that Labor never did when it was in government and something that I think has been greatly appreciated by the farmers of Bourke and Brewarrina.The announcements that I have made today in relation to Peak Downs essentially mean that farmers in that region can now obtain welfare benefits for six months while their application is under consideration. During that particular time we will look at the merits of the application and seek to process it. I do not expect it will take anything like six months to complete the consideration. We will do it as quickly as we possibly can. But what the farmers of Australia know is that this government has moved quickly to provide benefits when applications are received - in stark contrast to the New South Wales government, which requires farmers to wait six months after an area has been declared before it pays a single cent. We are paying money before the declaration; New South Wales requires them to wait six months. I think that the hypocrisy being demonstrated by the New South Wales Premier, aided and abetted by people on the opposite side of the House, is deplorable. It is a disgraceful attempt to use the suffering and misery of farmers for political advantage and it is a disgraceful approach that they should take in these sorts of issues. </DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her continuing interest in the sustainability of the Australian health system. I am pleased to inform the House that, in the September 2002 quarter, the number of Australians with private health insurance remained stable. Indeed, honourable members will be interested to know that the actual number of Australians covered by private health insurance grew by 4,268. There are some 8,709,000 Australians who now have private health insurance. This is an excellent result. It is the result of the success of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, the Lifetime Health Cover and the no gap policy. The period 2000-01 was the first time in the history of Medicare that the number of public hospital admissions in Australia fell by some 5,000. At the same time, the number of private hospital admissions in Australia grew by 245,000 - a significant number. Over half of medical procedures are now performed in private hospitals: for example, 50 per cent of chemotherapy, 53 per cent of major procedures for breast cancer, 56 per cent of cardiac valve procedures and some 60 per cent of major joint replacement and limb reattachment procedures.The honourable member asked me about any alternative policies or recent comments. Earlier this year - on 12 September - the opposition spokesperson on health, the member for Perth, described the 30 per cent rebate as a `public policy crime'. On ABC radio in Melbourne with John Payne, he said:Well, I think what you have to do, you can't return to the scene of the public policy crime which was the 30 per cent rebate.In fact, these comments were repeated in a doorstop interview. What is that public policy crime? What does this mean for the average Australian family? What the member for Perth is promoting is a $750 tax hike for the average Australian family. Here we have a Labor opposition that for six years has been a completely policy-free zone. The first hint of a policy from the Labor Party in relation to health is that effectively they are going to increase the tax on Australian families by $750. This completely ignores the fact that one million Australians with private health insurance have incomes of less than $20,000 - that is, many pensioners and self-funded retirees. - Once upon a time the Labor Party sought to represent ordinary Australians; today they have forgotten all about them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I make the opening remark that it has had very substantial support over many years to this point in time. Indeed, the member for Mallee will recall that I went down there and opened it at one stage -  - and had many meetings with the players. - I return to where I was and make the point that the member for Mallee has been a very enthusiastic supporter and promoter of this scheme. Indeed, there has been a contribution in the order of $25 million or so from the Commonwealth to date, with another $4 million this year and $3½ million for a cooperative feasibility study with the Victorian state government. - In terms of ongoing funding for what is undoubtedly a project with considerable merit, I make the point that we provide very substantial funding through mechanisms like the national action plan and the Natural Heritage Trust. - `Where is the money?' he asks. I just repeat the point that the sorts of initiatives we have put in place have seen something in the order of $2 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust and, indeed, about $1.5 billion for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. - I have just indicated that there are very substantial funding sources available for these sorts of things. So far as I am aware, the ministers for the environment and agriculture are engaged in fruitful and cooperative - up until now - discussions with the Victorian government about their priorities.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the government has been informed by United States intelligence authorities that they believe that the voice on the tape broadcast by al-Jazeera is that of Osama bin Laden. The tape is assessed by them to be authentic. The contents of the tape, I am sure all Australians will agree, is a chilling reminder of the evil and perverted character of the apparent leader of the deadliest terrorist threat the world has had in the lifetime of people in this parliament. It does underscore the heightened threat to Australia, including our interests overseas, from al-Qaeda since 11 September last year and especially after Osama bin Laden made specific reference to Australia in November 2001. The House will know that the assessed terrorist threat to Australia was increased following 11 September, and heightened measures to protect Australia and our interests abroad have been in place since then.Following a review after the Bali attack, further protective measures were agreed by the government. These included the acceleration of work to finalise better federal arrangements for responding to terrorism. The appropriateness of these steps has been reinforced by the tape. The al-Qaeda network was already judged to be a very significant threat to Australia and our interests overseas. That judgment has not changed; indeed, it has been reinforced by the material in the tape.It is worth making a number of observations about the contents of the tape. Although Western nations - and in particular, but not only, Australia - are targeted in the tape, the House should be reminded that, in the indiscriminate terrorist attacks which have occurred, the citizens of other than what loosely could be called `Western nations' have lost their lives. Osama bin Laden and his cohorts do not care whether they kill Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus or any other religious or ethnic group - or, indeed, people who profess no religion at all - in their campaign of terror. The range of nationalities of people who died on 11 September last year and 12 October this year indicates that no country can ignore the al-Qaeda threat.As I said in the House yesterday - and I repeat it with added emphasis - this government and this nation will not be intimidated by terrorist threats. That applies not only in relation to these statements but also to any other statements that may be made. I believe that this tape and what it represents reinforces the need for this country to remain an effective partner with other freedom loving countries in the campaign against terrorism. I have said before, and I repeat it: the terrorists have done terrible things over the last 18 months, but the ultimate terrorist nightmare would be if weapons of mass destruction were to fall into the hands of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts. That is the ultimate nightmare from terrorism. It follows from that that efforts must be sustained by the nations of the world to remove weapons of mass destruction from the hands of people who might capriciously use them.It is a chilling tape; it is the tape of somebody who, by his very reference to God, dishonours all of the great religions of the world. I find it so obscene that somebody should seek, in the name of God and in the name of Islam, to justify the sorts of deeds that have been committed by this organisation. I know that all Australians of whatever faith or, indeed, of no faith at all will join me in condemning what terrorism represents, condemning what this man stands for, repudiating to the depth of our being any notion that his actions have the sanction of a force beyond this world. It is an obscene notion and one that should be nailed as such.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the House that this morning Ambassador Bob Zoellick, United States Special Trade Representative, informed me and other members of the cabinet that President Bush had authorised him to send a letter to the United States Congress providing notification of the administration's intention to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. In welcoming this announcement, can I inform the House that this action triggers a 90-day consultation period with Congress, as required by US law, prior to the commencement of formal negotiations. We are hopeful that negotiations will start early next year. The ambassador told us this morning that the aim of the administration was to complete that negotiation during the remainder of President Bush's first term in office. This is, by any measure, a historic development in the bilateral relationship; it is unambiguously good news for Australia.A free trade agreement between Australia and the United States would deliver enormous economic benefits to this country. Economic modelling has found that removal of tariff barriers between Australia and the United States could increase Australia's gross domestic product by as much as $4 billion a year. A free trade agreement would facilitate linkages between Australia and the world's largest economy. The indirect benefits to our economy from both greater inwards and outwards investment flows could also be significant. It is worth observing, as the Treasurer did in our discussions with Ambassador Zoellick this morning, that currently the direct investment from Australia to the United States exceeds direct investment from the United States to Australia on an annual basis. That is an indication of the way in which investment between our two societies has burgeoned. None of us underestimates the challenges, but I am very confident that, if we work hard and we commit ourselves, we can achieve a favourable result. I told the ambassador that Australia will be seeking a comprehensive agreement. Both sides said that they will take a comprehensive approach to the negotiations. We have made it clear that agriculture must be part of the free trade agreement with the United States. We are not in any way going to compromise or sell out the interests of Australian farmers in pursuit of a free trade agreement with the United States or, indeed, with any other country. We will continue to consult very closely with industry sectors and relevant stakeholders in formulating our negotiating position.The Australian government believes - and I think it is worth making this point because of some of the observations that have been raised in criticism of the government's position on a possible free trade agreement with the United States - that the free trade negotiations with the United States will complement our joint efforts in the World Trade Organisation Doha Round to facilitate greater trade liberalisation globally. Free trade agreement negotiations with the United States will set a high standard and provide an important demonstration effect to help ratchet up the World Trade Organisation and other trade negotiations. It should be remembered that Ambassador Zoellick's visit here is for that primary purpose. He and the Minister for Trade have been working together very closely in the World Trade Organisation. The trade minister and the ambassador will continue to pursue that objective during the World Trade Organisation mini-ministerial meeting in Sydney this week.The World Trade Organisation Doha Round remains at the centre of Australia's trade policy. It offers the greatest broad-ranging benefits for Australia and the world economy. But it is a false and misleading notion to argue that you cannot, compatibly with supporting the World Trade Organisation Doha Round, also take advantage of bilateral trade opportunities as and when they arise. Where you can get benefit from a bilateral agreement, it is in the national interest to try to obtain it. That is why we are doing it now with the United States and why, within the region, we have recently been doing it with both Singapore and Thailand.I very warmly welcome this decision. It is a reminder to those who said it could not be achieved that, if there is enough political will at the top of two governments, it is possible. I do not know the final outcome, but we are very committed to achieving a positive outcome. I believe if we can achieve it it will be of lasting benefit to the people of both Australia and the United States.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister has explained, and in particular as Ambassador Zoellick explained both to the members of the cabinet who attended the meeting with him this morning and to the press conference that he gave jointly with the Prime Minister later, the proposal here is to have a comprehensive negotiation. When we get to the point of the actual negotiations - which will be around March next year - we will, in those circumstances, put forward our own specific set of proposals, and no doubt the United States will put forward its own specific set of proposals. Given the way that the member for Rankin asked his question, I would have thought it would be unlikely we would put forward a series of demands on ourselves; we would put forward a series of demands on the United States of America. And if the United States were to put forward the sorts of proposals the honourable member is talking about - I do not know whether they would or they would not - obviously that would be part of the negotiating process. I also observe that the member for Rankin has attacked the notion of a free trade agreement with the United States on a number of occasions and yet has not attacked the notion of a free trade agreement with Singapore or the fact that we would wish to negotiate a free trade agreement with Thailand or a new trade and economic agreement with Japan or a new framework economic agreement with China. He has not attacked those; he has only attacked - as he did in a disgraceful way last week - the notion of a free trade agreement with the United States of America. I just think that exposes, if ever it needed exposing, the bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party's policy approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I recognise the interest he has shown for a long period of time in the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. The government welcomes the news that Saddam Hussein's government has told the United Nations it will cooperate with new Security Council resolution 1441. I have no doubt that the threat of force has brought Saddam to this point. We should bear in mind that it is only a first step. We will judge Iraq by its actions from here on. The test remains Iraq's full and unconditional implementation of all of the terms of this resolution. I note with interest that Saddam Hussein's acceptance of Security Council resolution 1441 came with an assertion that Iraq does not possess weapons of mass destruction. This is not the case. This is why it is essential that inspectors be allowed into Iraq and why we expect Iraq to cooperate with the inspectors to enable them effectively and without hindrance to do their job. With Saddam Hussein's latest advice we expect that UNMOVIC and IAEA advance teams will be in Iraq next Monday - that is, 18 November. The Australian government have told UNMOVIC and the IAEA that we will support them in whatever way we can, consistent with our proud history of contributing to international disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.Dr Bill Jolley, an Australian currently working in UNMOVIC headquarters who comes from our home state of South Australia, will serve as a chief weapons inspector on the first UN inspections team in Iraq. A number of Australians have been trained as inspectors by UNMOVIC and are on the roster which will be drawn on as inspections teams are sent in. At this stage I understand that three Australians who are Department of Defence employees are likely to join the initial UNMOVIC inspections team. Australians with relevant expertise are also likely to participate, as time goes on, in IAEA inspections teams. While these individuals will serve as UN employees, it will not - it is important to understand - be as a national contingent. The government will facilitate their participation and strongly support their decision to go to Iraq. We are also talking to UNMOVIC about ongoing support by Australia for its activities in Iraq and how we might be able to assist.In answer, finally, to all aspects of the honourable member's question, let me say it is only through robust inspections that we can determine whether Saddam Hussein is deceiving the international community. As is well known, it is the view of the governments of the United States, of Great Britain, of Australia and of probably all the countries of the European Union and many others that Saddam Hussein is deceiving the international community. It is clear he does have a weapons of mass destruction capability. I think it is important to remember this: he has only a short period of time - I think until 8 December - to declare the presence of those weapons of mass destruction capabilities in Iraq.</DOC>

 - The income tax take as a proportion of the economy this year is lower than it was in the first year of this government. That is because this government reduced income tax rates on 1 July 2000. But the income tax take, as a proportion of GDP, varies not only according to the income tax rates but according to the number of people who are in work. One of the reasons that the Australian Labor Party is able to say that in the early 1990s the income tax to GDP rate was lower is that unemployment was 11.3 per cent. On the same income tax rates it stands to reason that, with one million more people paying income tax, the tax to GDP ratio would rise. The fact that we now have one million people more in work does not mean that the average person is paying more tax. Patently, they are not. Their tax rates are lower and were reduced in July 2000. What it means, incidentally, is that you get benefits to the economy if people come into work because not only do they start paying tax but unemployment benefits reduce. So let us compare the record to date: one million more people, lower tax rates, income tax being collected from those in work and the budget balanced rather than being two to three per cent in deficit, as it was in the early 1990s.The Australian economy continues to grow as the fastest growing economy of the developed world. We survived the US recession of 2001. We were promised by the Australian Labor Party that our reforms of 2000 would throw the economy into recession. Nobody made that more plain than the member for Hotham, who claimed that we would be in recession as a result of tax reform. He was partly right: there was a recession in 2001; it was in the United States. But it was not in Australia. We on this side of the House are very pleased that an additional one million Australians have jobs, that they are paying income tax and, that as a consequence, the Australian economy is strong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can inform her that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released average weekly earnings statistics today which showed that full-time adult ordinary time earnings increased in the quarter by 1.4 per cent and by 4.9 per cent for the year. Employees' total earnings increased by 1.3 per cent for the quarter and by 3.6 per cent for the year. The important thing about earnings is that, if you have growth in productivity, earnings can grow without being inflationary. If, for example, inflation is two or 2½ per cent, as it currently is in the Australian economy, and you have productivity growth of two per cent then a wage increase of 4½ per cent will not be inflationary. Because we do have high productivity in this country, we are not only keeping inflation restrained but we can have a growth in real wages. I said earlier that, over the course of the six years since the government was elected in 1996, over one million new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. The House will be interested to know that I was looking at the Daily Telegraph yesterday. It runs a historical series of what happened 10 years ago, and it featured the front page of the Daily Telegraph Mirror of 13 November 1992. On 13 November 1992 - 10 years ago - the Daily Telegraph Mirror recorded this:Unemployment soars to the highest level recorded since the Great Depression 60 years ago. An extra 52,200 people joined the dole queue, bringing the number out of work to 979,000 or 11.3 per cent.Last month the unemployment rate stood at six per cent, which was the equal lowest since that Labor Party high of 11.3 per cent. There will be some new members in this House who would think six per cent was a normal unemployment rate in Australia. Let me tell you that it is not. Those of us who were here 10 years ago when the member for Brand was the employment minister, closely followed by the member for Hotham, remember 11.3 per cent unemployment. We also remember at that time that one of the proudest boasts of the Australian Labor Party was how they kept real wages low. Those of us who were here will remember the then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister coming to the dispatch box and saying that one of the greatest achievements of the Labor government was to keep real wages low. The member for Batman smiles, because he was in the ACTU at the time and will remember all the work that the Labor Party went to to try to keep the growth in real wages down.Let me just finish by reminding the House of one comparison, because we on this side of the House actually believe that non-inflationary real wages growth is a good thing. We actually want workers to be paid better; we are actually in favour of productivity improvements which will improve their real wages. Over the last six years real wages in this country have grown by 11 per cent under the coalition government. Over 13 years of Labor Party government real wages grew by 1.8 per cent. They were growing at 0.1 per cent per annum; they are now growing at around two per cent per annum - on one million extra jobs. That is the sign of economic reform and management. What could the Labor Party do to help the Australian economy? Get out of the way. That is the best thing that the Australian Labor Party could do. They should get out of the way, vote through the coalition program in relation to unfair dismissal laws and the budget, and let ordinary Australians have a decent go.</DOC>

 - As I previously indicated, one of the reasons why tax revenues collected by the government can be higher is if you have more people in work. - What I will probably do is go back and look at the Labor Party tax take on the basis of another one million jobs. I think that would be a very interesting adjustment -  - because, as I said, income tax rates in this country have been cut. - And in cutting income tax rates, because more people have got into work, the government has actually been able to maintain its revenue take. That is a good thing, actually. As it turns out, it is a good thing to have more people in work paying lower taxes - so that you can fund your expenditures - rather than fewer people in work paying higher taxes, and to have larger expenditures including unemployment benefits.In addition to the income tax cuts which the government introduced on 1 July 2000 - when we reduced the 20 per cent income tax rate to 17 per cent, when we reduced those above 43 per cent to 40 per cent and when we put 80 per cent of Australians on a tax rate of 30 per cent or less by taking the 30 per cent rate up to $50,000 - the government also reduced taxes in other significant ways. We introduced a rebate for private health insurance, now worth 30 per cent of private health insurance premiums -  - Which Labor voted against and which Labor calls a crime - that is what the member for Perth called it. In addition to that, we introduced new and additional family tax benefits; some of which are claimed on the tax side of the budget and many of which are actually claimed on the expenditure side of the budget, notwithstanding the fact that they are benefits off tax by way of rebates to individual families. From memory, we actually increased the family tax benefits by $2 billion. So the whole taxation system was moved down, family benefits were increased, the private health insurance rebate was introduced, one million people came into the tax system and government revenues were able to not only balance the budget but also afford a decent expenditure system. They are the benefits of economic reform, they are the benefits which the Australian Labor Party opposed, and they are the benefits which the Australian Labor Party could do its best for by getting out of the way and by allowing the government to put its program through the Senate and have the opportunity to continue to strengthen the Australian economy - now the fastest growing economy in the developed world. Wouldn't it be great if we could keep it there, after having come through those Labor years of recession? - I am just trying to explain what this one shows so that people are aware of it. - I also wish to table a copy of the chart I displayed earlier.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. She rightly recognises that this drought is affecting not only the dryland agricultural areas of Australia but also the irrigated areas. The shortage of water, particularly in the Murray-Darling system, is causing considerable concern to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and all of those who are associated with managing the water supplies for not just the irrigators but also the urban and industrial users in the Murray-Darling system. I have asked the Murray-Darling commission to immediately look at options to deal with the urgent shortfall that is occurring in the River Murray system, particularly in the summer and autumn of 2003. The commission will be looking at its longer term operating relationship with Snowy Hydro and the operating procedures governing the flexibility of movement along the Murray River system. But it is also important that we look at ways in which savings can be made within the system. At the last meeting of the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council, the states were asked to identify potential savings within their system that could be returned, either for additional use or for environmental flows. Between them, the basin states were able to identify potential savings of about 400 gigalitres. To put that into some degree of context, there are proposals being considered at the present time for increased environmental flows into the Murray-Darling of between 350 gigalitres and 1,500 gigalitres. Of that 400 gigalitres, 200 gigalitres have already been committed to the Snowy system, so potentially the states were only able to identify about 200 gigalitres of savings. Even that did not come cheaply: it is estimated between the various states as being between $1 million and $3 million a gigalitre. The costs are very, very substantial, and I think it is important for the House to understand that there is no such thing anymore as free water. Even water that is going to go into environmental flows will be extremely expensive, and there will be substantial costs associated with achieving water savings.I think it is important that we look also at other ways in which water can be saved. There is potential for on-farm savings, but those savings are going to be very difficult to achieve without a secure water rights regime. That is why the meeting of COAG early next month will be particularly important in driving an appropriate, secure and bankable water rights regime. Farmers have no incentive to make water savings if in fact there is no security for them in the resource that they have. In addition, they cannot possibly borrow from a bank to undertake savings if in fact there is not going to be any security to ensure that they can use the water. I think that there are a lot of ideas also in the community. I am encouraging people to come forward with ideas, and we can look then at evaluating them and at what potential savings they might be able to deliver. The honourable member has been particularly active in putting forward a proposal with the Pratt group to look at some pilot water savings in the Murrumbidgee region. I commend her on the leadership and the initiative that she has provided in that regard. The New South Wales and Commonwealth governments have agreed now to look at ways in which we can test some of the ideas that are being put forward for the Murrumbidgee area, and they could provide examples for use in other parts of Australia. That is an excellent example. We want to build on that.  This is a dry continent and, in these times, it is especially important that we look at ways of using our water wisely and well. In this sort of context, the government certainly stands ready to work with the states to endeavour to achieve savings wherever possible. They will be in the interests not just of helping to make our scarce water resources more valued and more readily available to those who need them and to maintain the development and environmental objectives that we have in the basin but also of ensuring that we are better equipped to meet future droughts when they arrive.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that Ralph Willis's adviser would know that it does not mean that at all. It does not mean that at all. As I said, income tax take is a function not only of tax rates, which have been reduced, but of the number of people in work. And, as more people come into work, on the same tax rates you collect more money - not because people are paying more but because more people are working. That is actually one of the objects of economic policy, as it turns out - to get people into work. Not only is it good for people to get jobs but it is good for the economy because you collect tax rather than pay unemployment benefits. If we could get more people into work on the same tax rates, we would collect more income tax again. How could we get more people into work? Well, pass the unfair dismissal laws. -  - I suppose they will now say they are only opposing the unfair dismissal laws because they want to keep the tax take down: `We oppose the unfair dismissal laws, we keep more people out of work and that is the way that Labor keeps taxes down in this country!'  - He's nodding! - As I said in answer to the earlier question, when this government -  - In relation to income tax, the income tax take as a proportion of GDP in this financial year is lower than it was in 1996-97, when the government was first elected. Let us go over it so that this is clearly understood. The income tax take, as a proportion of GDP, six years after the election of this government is lower than it was six years ago and one million people, additionally, are paying tax. So one million people have come into the work force and are paying tax, but the tax take as a proportion of GDP is lower. Why is that? Because income tax rates were dramatically cut in July 2000.  - As a consequence of the income tax cuts which this government put in place, the 20 per cent rate came down to 17 per cent, 34 per cent came down to 30 per cent, the ones in the 40s came down to 40 per cent and the top threshold was pushed out to $60,000. As it turned out, we wanted to push that threshold out further and reduce income tax even more. There was a reason why the government was unable to reduce income tax any more and I am surprised it has been forgotten. The Labor Party defeated our proposals in the Senate to cut income tax further.Opposition members - Oh! - `Oh,' they say. `Oh, we forgot about that.' Yes, they did forget about that. Let us just get the Labor Party's policy clear. The Labor Party policy, as far as I can work it out now, is the following. They are voting against expenditure restraint - that is why they are voting against Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes. They would like a bigger surplus and they would also like lower income taxes. Why didn't we think of that? Lower taxes, higher spending and at the end of it you all got a budget surplus. They keep coming up with new ideas, these people! He used to be called B.S. Crean - Bigger Surplus Crean. He is against the expenditure rate, he wants a bigger surplus and he is also in favour of lower income taxes. We had the biggest income tax cut in Australian history on 1 July 2000. Two years after the event, we still have the strongest growing economy in the developed world. There is a reason why we do not get any questions about the economy. It is because Labor's record compared to the coalition's record speaks for itself and they can take full responsibility for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I note his strong interest in Indigenous employment initiatives in his electorate. While Indigenous unemployment is slowly trending down, it is still three times the national average. Bad though the statistics are, they actually mask the true extent of Indigenous unemployment because most Aboriginal workers have jobs which are funded by the taxpayer. The government's Indigenous Employment Program aims to get unemployment down, but more importantly it aims to get employment in private sector organisations up. I am pleased to say that the number of Indigenous training jobs has nearly doubled in the past three years to nearly 5,000. I am particularly pleased that more than 80 per cent of these training jobs are with the private sector. The number of Indigenous wage subsidy agreements is also improving after a bit of a dip last year. Again, more than 80 per cent of these are with the private sector. It is still, regrettably, a stand-out fact that the shops and businesses of country Australia have plenty of Indigenous customers but they have very few Indigenous employees. The government is determined to try to break down typecasting, particularly by employers. Under the CEOs' initiative, some 62 large Australian companies have pledged to do more to help potential Aboriginal employees. More than half of these have already established dedicated training jobs for Indigenous Australians.In remote areas, there are very few jobs except those which Aboriginal people can create for themselves. It is hard for people who have no history of credit to get access to capital. I can tell the House today that my department is trialing a microcredit initiative in selected remote Aboriginal communities to provide interest free business loans of up to $5,000 to potential Indigenous entrepreneurs. As Noel Pearson has said, Aboriginal people have a right to take responsibility and the government wants to see grassroots capitalism in these communities drawing on the creativity and initiative of Indigenous Australians. </DOC>

 - The Labor Party works on the old union tactic that if you restate a falsity often enough you will get somebody to publish it. Not only is the income tax share of GDP lower today than it was when this government was elected -  - Your table shows that it is lower this year than it was in the first year that the government was elected. The Labor Party table shows that. There it is; it is lower today than it was in 1996-97. - I ask people to look at the document he tabled, which shows that it is lower in 2002-03 than it was in 1996-97, notwithstanding the fact that there are one million more people paying income tax. So the tax rate is lower, and one million more people are in work. Why is that? Because income tax rates have been cut under this government. The other measure that is indicative of taxation is overall taxation to GDP, which, as we know, has also been reduced as a consequence of the government's changes in relation to company tax, which it cut; capital gains tax, which it cut; financial institutions duty, which it abolished; stamp duty on shares, which it abolished; and all of the bed taxes and so on that it abolished as well. So let us put that canard to bed before the Australian Labor Party tries to repeat it too many times.In relation to the family allowance, the question now seeks to put together two factors. One is the income tax rate, which for average families is now 30 per cent but which under Labor was - from memory - 34 per cent and 42 per cent. For average families, instead of paying 34 per cent and 42 per cent, they are now paying 30 per cent. He added on top of that the withdrawal rate of the family allowance. The withdrawal rate of the family allowance is 30 cents in the dollar when you trigger the income tests. Did we actually introduce the withdrawal rate for the family allowance? Did we introduce that? It was actually introduced by the Australian Labor government.The member for Lilley stands up here and insinuates that he is actually against a withdrawal rate on the family allowance. If you are against a withdrawal rate on the family allowance, would you please say so clearly to the people of Australia. You introduced it and you have now been to three elections, in 1996, 1998 and 2001, and supported it. If you are actually in favour of reducing the taper on the family allowance, the people of Australia would be very interested to know it. But I do not think you are, because I do not think this is actually a serious policy question. I think it is one of those issues which the Australian Labor Party is trying to use to make false allegations. The tax is 30 per cent on families and the taper rate is 30 per cent, as it was under the Australian Labor Party. It comes in at a higher threshold because we pushed out the threshold - you recall that - so that it did not cut in until people were on higher incomes. As a result of that, we have an income tested family allowance system. We on this side of the House are in favour of an income tested family allowance system. The Australian Labor Party was in favour of it because it introduced it. It was in favour of it in 1996, 1998 and 2001. If the Australian Labor Party now wants to oppose it, it should say so openly and we will cost it.  - We will work out what other taxes the Australian Labor Party will have to put up in order to pay for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question on this important subject. Australians have enjoyed good health by international standards because we have a comprehensive health system in this country. An integral part of that health system is a sustainable and affordable Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, one which has stood this country in good stead over the past 50 years. However, there have been increases in the cost of that. In 1990, the PBS cost the nation $1 billion. Today it costs almost $5 billion and it is projected that, if the current growth rate continues, it could cost as much as $60 billion by 2040. Therefore, in order to ensure the ongoing sustainability and affordability of this scheme, the government propose that we increase the copayment - a copayment first introduced by the Australian Labor Party - from $3.60 to $4.60 for concessional cardholders and from $22.40 to $28.60 for other Australians.This ought to be put in the context of the actual cost of the pharmaceuticals and the medicines concerned. If we look at the end of December last year and the drugs, pharmaceuticals and medicines most commonly prescribed in Australia, we find the most common were for cholesterol - Lipex or Zocor. The average cost of a prescription for these drugs is $60.86. We are proposing that a concessional cardholder would pay no more than $4.60. Take Lipitor, the second most prescribed drug in Australia. The actual cost per prescription is $59.71. Again, it is proposed that a concessional cardholder would pay no more than $4.60. Take Losec, which is used for peptic ulcers. The actual cost for that is $64.14. Again, a concessional cardholder would pay no more than $4.60. Take Celebrex, which is commonly used in the treatment of arthritis. The prescription cost is $46.92, for which it is proposed a concessional cardholder would pay no more than $4.60. As the Treasurer indicated yesterday, concessional cardholders on average fill 19 prescriptions per year, so the increase, with the safety net in place, for a person who has a concessional card - that is, a pensioner or a self-funded retiree - would be just $19.00.The real question is for the Labor Party. Back in 1990, when the copayment was introduced, the then leader of the Australian Labor Party, Paul Keating, said about copayments that Australians risk losing:... the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy.The choice facing the Australian Labor Party today is whether or not it is prepared to support the changes to this scheme which will ensure that, for not just the last 50 years but the next 50 years and for not only this generation but also future generations of Australians, we have a sustainable and affordable pharmaceutical benefits system in place. Does the Australian Labor Party any longer pretend to represent ordinary Australians or is it just concerned with the wealthy, because they will be the only ones able to afford drugs into the future? - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, but the reality is that we have a Labor Party that wants to increase the tax hike so far as the private health system is concerned, a Labor Party that wants to increase the cost of drugs for ordinary Australians. That is the choice before you at the present time. Do you want to have a sustainable system into the future or not? </DOC>

 - All of us would like to see the Ansett ticket levy go when it is possible, but it is worth firstly making the point that this was to fund a set of entitlements and arrangements for workers who otherwise would have been severely disadvantaged and represented something that the Australian Labor Party never attempted to do for workers, as a principle, and which has not been supported by the Labor Party here or in any of the states since. Worse than that is the constant misrepresentation by the ACTU of what we did for workers. They have continued to claim that `workers have not seen any of the ticket tax at all'. They were never to see any of the ticket tax. It was used to fund, if you like, an overdraft facility, out of which some $330 million has been made available to Ansett workers - a large amount of money that would simply not have been forthcoming if it had not been for our actions to this point. That is an average of $26,000 per worker.I would have thought that the member for Batman, an ex-ACTU spokesman, would have not only been prepared to say that what the government has done has been very valuable, has been the right and Australian thing to do for people left behind in an unfortunate situation, but also repudiated his successors at the ACTU who continue to misrepresent what the government has done. I have a reasonable hope - I think I can say at this stage - that we can expect to recover some or even all of the expenditure over time but the fact of the matter is that, as the member for Batman knows, there is a court case pending which raises uncertainties about a superannuation sum that may have to be recovered from the creditors and which may impact on the funds available for the government to recoup the costs involved. I hope that court procedure will be wound up over the next few weeks. I cannot speculate on the outcome, but I hope we will have the certainty very soon to enable us to wind the tax up. Nobody would like to see that more than I would, but it has been the right thing to do. - So far as a departure tax is concerned, there has been no talk of that in government circles. To the very best of my knowledge, that is a proposal that comes out of thin air. I am certainly not aware of any such idea.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume, who is a fair dinkum Australian, for his question and his commitment to apprentices and training. As of 30 June there were 362,000 Australians in apprenticeships and training. That is a 15 per cent increase over the last year. As the member for Hume will be pleased to hear, completions increased by 27 per cent last year to 107,000. Importantly, 38 per cent of those 362,000 apprentices are in traditional trades. Particularly for those representing rural and regional Australia, especially those concerned on this side of the House, one-third of those apprentices are from the rural parts of Australia. One of the other things the government have done is make sure that employers have red tape cut. The government recently announced a package of measures which would make it easier for employers to take on apprentices. We have cut red tape, we have put more emphasis on not only commencement but also completion and especially on making it easier in areas of skill shortages and in rural and regional Australia. The question is: what are the priorities of the Australian Labor Party? The member for Hume has asked me a question about apprentices and training, as have many members on this side. After 354 days of having the privilege of being the Minister for Education, Science and Training I have not had one single question from the Australian Labor Party about apprentices - not one single question! Yet yesterday the member for Jagajaga - the Labor Party's deputy leader, who is supposed to be driving policy reform in the Labor Party - issued a media release under the heading Nelson ignores financial plight of student. She saids:Young people are leaving university saddled with debts of up to $30,000 There are 2,200 of the 1,115,000 people who owe a HECS debt in this country who owe $30,000. The Labor Party's priority is dentists, lawyers, doctors and people leaving university with $30,000 worth of debt, instead of people like the member for Hume, who was a slaughterman in his mid-teens. The member for Grey was a labourer and a shearer; the member for Leichhardt, as we know, at the age of 13 was cleaning toilets at Maroubra train station to pay for the university education of the Leader of the Opposition. The reality -  - One-third of all of the teenage children in this country currently in full-time employment are apprentices and trainees, and they deserve a little bit of attention in this House. Tomorrow is a very important day because of two things. Tomorrow is an important day because all of the training ministers throughout Australia will meet in Sydney to consider something extremely important: whether or not in this country we will have uniformity in terms of recognition of apprenticeship training and quality. What that means is that, if you are a parent of a daughter doing hospitality or a son training to be a baker in Victoria, and your child, having done their apprenticeship, wants to move to Queensland or South Australia, then they need to be able to do it and to be recognised in doing so.At the moment the Australian Labor Party is preventing national uniformity in the training of our apprentices. If the New South Wales labour council can tell the New South Wales government who to appoint to the ACCC, then my challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to get on the phone to the state Labor governments and implore them, on behalf of the more than 200,000 kids under 25 doing apprenticeships, to move to national consistency. If we do not, then we will not have a future which offers hope and practical training for the young Australians of this country. When we come back to this House I will be able to report, Prime Minister, on whether the Australian Labor Party has been able to put the interests of apprentices and trainees at least alongside the interests of those who are getting a university education, about whom the Labor Party is preoccupied.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I particularly appreciate him asking this question because he very recently - I think just last week - led a parliamentary delegation to Papua New Guinea which, amongst other things, met with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. I understand that it was extraordinarily successful so I would like to take the opportunity to thank him for his good work. In terms of contact with the new government in Papua New Guinea, I think the House would be aware that the Prime Minister met with the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare, during a visit to Papua New Guinea in August. This evening I leave for Papua New Guinea with a delegation of ministers - the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister for Finance and Administration - to attend the Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum, which will take place tomorrow. This is the 14th of those forums and this will be the 11th visit that I will have made to Papua New Guinea in my time as the foreign minister.This forum tomorrow is very timely. There is no doubt that Papua New Guinea faces major economic, environmental and also social challenges. I particularly draw the House's attention to the problems in Papua New Guinea of declining revenue, declining infrastructure and a weakening of government and social institutions. The Australian government is committed to working with a reform minded Papua New Guinean government to assist with and to encourage the process of reform in that country. We know only too well of the importance of Papua New Guinea remaining engaged with international financial institutions and continuing to pursue the process of structural and economic reform that was begun by the last Papua New Guinean government. I think one of this government's proudest achievements was the role it played in bringing a civil war in Bougainville to an end. We will, of course, be taking the opportunity to discuss the current situation in Bougainville with our Papua New Guinean counterparts. We will also be thanking the Papua New Guinean government for the constructive role it has played in helping us combat the problem of people-smuggling, by providing a processing centre on Manus Island until October 2003. The role that Papua New Guinea has played has been important in ensuring the success we have had over the last year in dealing with the problem of people-smuggling.In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my sympathy for the Papua New Guinean foreign minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, who is very well known to many members of this House, as his son was involved in a very serious car accident the other day. Sir Rabbie has accompanied his son to Townsville for medical treatment. He will of course, therefore, not be able to participate in the forum tomorrow. I know I speak on behalf of all members - and I know so many of you know Sir Rabbie - when I say that our sympathy goes to him at this very difficult and trying time. We wish his son a rapid recovery.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I am not across all the detail of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's paper, although I should tell the House that I very much welcome the paper. I think it is a very interesting and thoughtful contribution, insofar as I am across it, to the very important workplace relations reform debate in this country. As I understand their proposal, it is not to opt out of the law as such; it is to opt out of a particular form of regulatory framework. They would still operate under the law but they would operate outside a particular framework administered by the Industrial Relations Commission. I do not believe that there is anything particularly remarkable about this suggestion. It is a worth while one. It builds on suggestions that have been previously made by the Mines and Metals Association. As with all suggestions that are made in this way, the government will carefully consider it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth. His commitment to investing in individuals is well acknowledged in his own electorate, which is a culturally and a linguistically diverse part of Australia. It is important, from this government's point of view, that we strongly invest in individuals upon their arrival in Australia. We strongly encourage the learning of the English language. We give 500 hours of free English classes for humanitarian entrants, and refugees have the option of an extra 100 hours. To obtain citizenship a knowledge of basic English is required. Since its establishment in 1948, the Adult Migrant English Program has helped more than 1.6 million migrants and refugees to this country learn English. Indeed, investing in them helps them in their settlement in Australia. The annual budget is over $100 million, and over six million hours of English language tuition has been provided over the years. The AMEP plays an important role in helping newcomers become active and also accepted members of the Australian family.The House will be interested to know that we are planning for something like 34,800 new-arrival clients during the current financial year, and this represents an increase of 12.5 per cent over last year. Next year it is expected to rise to approximately 38,800 clients from 180 different countries and 100 different language backgrounds. It is certainly clear that that particular increase we have seen this year is going to be part of an ongoing upward trend, because this government has decided to boost the overall size of the migration program. In the past year, the Adult Migrant English Program - a showcase program of investment in individuals - has improved its overall reach to eligible clients by 6.4 per cent, from 68.8 per cent in 2000 to over 75 per cent in 2001. Tomorrow here in Canberra I will be officially opening the annual conference of the Adult Migrant English Program. `Change and continuity' is the conference theme, and 200 AMEP teachers and service providers will be investing three days in enhancing their already quite profound skills to improve the delivery of this important program.In the last 18 months those who are part of the Adult Migrant English Program have been able to access an Australian citizenship course, which has been linked to the AMEP. The `Let's participate: a course in Australian citizenship' program has been very popular. All prospective candidates have been able to access information about that through a booklet entitled What it means to be an Australian citizen. This gives them a brief overview of what many of us perhaps take for granted - the way this country runs, our traditions, our institutions, our system of government and what it means to be an Australian citizen. As I have said on many occasions, citizenship is the glue which binds our culturally and linguistically diverse society together. It is important that all of us in this place - indeed, all of us in public life - at this time in our nation's history, and indeed in the world's history, be wise in the words we choose and seek to be part of the unity ticket rather than the ticket of division. It is important that all of us provide that leadership.  -  - When I note comments, motions and efforts by some members opposite - comments by the member for Rankin, a motion by the member for Fowler, claims by the member for Greenway about migrant resource centre funding at Blacktown, and comments by the member for Reid about migrant resource centre funding at Parramatta - I know that those opposite are all too often part of the business of division rather than unity, part of the business of attempting to make people feel awkward and unwelcome in Australia. It is important that the government's investment in individuals produces real results. All I ask those opposite to do is join the unity ticket of welcoming all people who come to this country through the migration system and to recognise the government's commitment to the investment in those people to produce great outcomes for people of all backgrounds in this country.</DOC>

 - I have heard of those reports. In the past few days that issue has specifically been raised in quite a lengthy personal discussion with me by the Deputy Prime Minister. In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister has been at the forefront of bringing to my attention the importance of preserving the breeding herds and breeding stock of this country as it is faced by the drought. The availability of exceptional circumstances depends upon a number of factors. Those factors are a measurement of the severity of the drought as it affects particular areas. I think the member will know that exceptional circumstances applications are initiated by state governments. I imagine that he, as the member for New England, would have been in close and immediate contact with the New South Wales government to ensure that, if there are exceptional circumstances conditions existing in parts of his electorate, the appropriate action is taken - and speedily - by the New South Wales government. I shall undertake to the House to make inquiries as to whether any applications covering his electorate have come from the New South Wales government.Let me more generally assure the House that, because my attention was drawn to this issue by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party earlier this week, I have already asked in discussion with my colleagues that consideration be given to this issue. I also had the opportunity of discussing the matter with the leadership of the National Farmers Federation on Tuesday night. I drew attention to the action that had been taken by the Fraser government 20 years ago during the 1982 drought to preserve the breeding stock and the valuable asset that it represented. It provided a capacity for the Australian economy to come out of that drought, when it did rain, very effectively.I can assure the honourable member that, if additional steps are needed, they will be taken. I have to say that the reaction I got from the National Farmers Federation was that, broadly speaking, there was not overwhelming evidence that a specific program at this stage for the preservation of breeding stock was needed. It is an issue that is very much in my mind, largely due to it having been brought to my attention by the Leader of the National Party. </DOC>

 - As the honourable member for Pearce indicates in her question, today is World Diabetes Day, a day recognised by the International Diabetes Federation in collaboration with the World Health Organisation. It is important because it is estimated that some 350 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. I take this opportunity to commend the honourable member for Pearce, along with other members of this House, including the member for Blair and the member for Lyons, for their work to prevent diabetes.It is estimated that one in 13 deaths in Australia are due to diabetes or diabetes related illnesses. Therefore, it is a major issue in the health of our community. Indeed, it has been estimated that some 400,000 Australians have undiagnosed diabetes. So questions about awareness of the existence of the condition for individuals and prevention through more exercise and better diet are extremely important in dealing with it.In the last year the Howard government introduced the $76 million National Integrated Diabetes Program, which is a world first program to improve care of people with diabetes through their general practitioner. A new National Diabetes Services Scheme agreement between Diabetes Australia and the Commonwealth government helps diabetics to access essential products at subsidised rates. Indeed, in the last financial year diagnostic agents and insulin were subsidised by $232 million on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Just last month, the health minister announced a further $2 million to fund a program of research, health information and intervention aimed at raising awareness and reducing the burden of type 2 diabetes in Australia.The message of today, World Diabetes Day, is that diabetes is not a trivial condition; in fact, it is a hidden killer in our society. It has potentially dangerous and serious complications for those who are suffering from it. I encourage all people who have not had the simple test for diabetes to go to their GP and have that simple test, because, as I said, it is estimated that there are some 400,000 Australians who have diabetes and are unaware of the condition.</DOC>

 - The answer is, of course, that I did not make any such suggestion, and the Leader of the Opposition knows that. Isn't it interesting that once again we have a classic operation of the Labor Party doctrine that -  - whenever there is a difference between a position taken by the leader of the government in Australia and some spokesman from another country, Australia is always wrong in their eyes. - Let me take the House through exactly what I said - and may I say at the outset that I do not resile in any way from the remarks that were made yesterday. I was asked a question by the interviewer on a Channel 9 program, and this is what I had to say:Oh yes, I think any Australian Prime Minister would. I mean, it stands to reason that if you believed that somebody was going to launch an attack against your country, either of a conventional kind or of a terrorist kind, and you had a capacity to stop it and there was no alternative other than to use that capacity then of course you would have to use it.I ask not only members on my side but also members on the other side: do you seriously dispute that proposition? Could any Australian parliamentary representative seriously dispute the proposition? I find it fascinating that the Labor Party is saying that there is something wrong with an Australian prime minister saying to the Australian public that, if he were aware of a circumstance where there might be an attack on this country and he had a capacity to stop that, he would not - if other alternatives were not available - use that capacity. Let me just say again that, if any Australian prime minister were to be guilty of that, he would be failing the most basic test.It is very interesting to examine the reaction of those who sit opposite. We had the member for Griffith out this morning, getting himself into a lather of sweat on this particular subject, and then we had the Leader of the Opposition. Very interestingly, the Leader of the Opposition was asked this question, amongst many other questions. The journalist said:Getting back to the threat of a terrorist attack - which, of course, was the context in which I was asked the question. - The question continued:though, if you became aware of that and it were imminent -   - I will repeat that question asked by the journalist:Getting back to the threat of a terrorist attack, though, if you became aware of that and it were imminent, you may not have time for talking. Would you support a pre-emptive strike in that case?The answer:CREAN: That is a different proposition.`That is a different proposition,' he says! - How indeed? My learned friend for Gippsland asks the rhetorical question: `How?' That is exactly the context in which I was asked the question. But it gets even better! The Leader of the Opposition goes on to say:Under the UN charter, there is already the capacity for member nations, in self-defence, and where they can identify clear and present danger, to take appropriate action.The question may well be asked -  - What is the Leader of the Opposition getting into a lather of sweat about? The reality is that, when it comes to standing up for Australian interests, you can always rely on the Australian Labor Party to take the point of view of those who would criticise this country. I want to make two other points. The first of those points is that nothing that I said yesterday was in any way directed against the countries of our region. It was not in any way directed against the governments of the countries of our region. In fact, only yesterday I signed a personal message to President Megawati of Indonesia, thanking her very warmly for the very effective cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police in the pursuit of those responsible for the Bali atrocity. I emphasise that, notwithstanding what has been falsely alleged by others, nothing that I said yesterday was directed against our friends in neighbouring countries. The other point I would make is about this canard that was put around by the member for Griffith that, in some way, what I was saying yesterday was related to Australia's attitude in relation to Iraq. It was not. It related to the willingness of this country to defend Australia's national interest. It related to the determination of this government to take legitimate measures if other alternatives were not available, if there were a clear, precise, identifiable threat. I repeat what I said yesterday: any Australian prime minister unwilling to do that would be failing the most basic test of office.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. Naturally enough, this question of the closure of our embassy in the Philippines has generated a certain amount of publicity. I returned from East Timor on the evening of Wednesday, 27 November, to be confronted with intelligence which led me to conclude that the only thing to do was to immediately close the embassy in the Philippines, at least, of course, on a temporary basis. The information we had was credible and it was specific in relation to a threat against our embassy. I also note that the Canadian embassy and the European Union mission in Manila were also closed on the basis of the same information. There have been some media reports that the threat came from Jemaah Islamiah, but I believe the threats are from a terrorist group in the Philippines. The precise identity of the group cannot be confirmed at this stage.The Australian Ambassador to Manila informed the Philippines authorities of our decision on Wednesday, 27 November, and she has continued to be in close touch with Philippine ministers and senior officials as the situation develops. On Friday, 29 November, I spoke with the Philippines Foreign Secretary, Blas Ople. As a result of that conversation, I am confident that Foreign Secretary Ople accepts the reasons behind our decision and understands that we have to put, first and foremost, the safety and security of the 140 people who work in the Australian embassy in the Philippines as a paramount consideration. The Australian embassy is located in a building which is surrounded by busy streets and has significant glass frontage. There is very little distance between the street itself and the chancery, making it extremely difficult, despite efforts made by the Philippines police and marines, to secure the building. I have made it clear to Foreign Secretary Ople that we are only closing our embassy on a temporary basis. We hope that in the next week or so it will be possible to reopen the embassy for normal business. We are working with the Philippines government also to secure the site, and I think a good deal has been done to achieve that already. I am also looking at the longer term security options for our embassy there, given its location, including the possibility of moving the embassy to a new site. Naturally enough, the government does give a lot of priority to the security of our diplomatic staff abroad, as we do to all Australians abroad and indeed to those local staff who work for our embassies. The government has now approved an additional $31.7 million to be spent over the next five years to introduce a range of new security measures at our overseas posts. This will enhance the security of our missions in the region and some of our missions beyond the region.Finally, let me say in answer to the honourable member for Curtin's question that, in response to the threat we received last week in relation to our embassy, we have revised our Philippines travel advice to recommend that Australians defer non-essential travel. We have put in place arrangements to ensure that embassy staff remain in close contact with the Australian community and to provide emergency consular assistance.</DOC>

 - I have a couple of comments in response to that. The first is that land tax, the last time I checked, was a state tax. The second observation I would make is that taxes have been reduced under my government very significantly. Coming to Senator Coonan's situation, I have read that article. I understand that in another place the senator will be saying something about it. On the information that is available to me, Senator Coonan has not in any way breached the ministerial guidelines. Of course I expect everybody to meet their taxation liability, including all members of parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook. I can inform him that last week the government released the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The government revised down the growth forecast for the current financial year from 3¾ per cent to three per cent, largely as a consequence of drought. At budget time we were forecasting that the rural sector - the farm sector - would grow at about 3¾ per cent. As a consequence of the drought, we are now forecasting that it will contract by 17 per cent in 2002-03. That in itself accounts for the downgrade in the growth forecast from 3¾ per cent to three per cent. In addition to that, the international economy continues to disappoint, with weakness in the United States and Europe and ongoing problems in Japan. The domestic economy, notwithstanding that, continues to perform strongly. Since the mid-year review we have had capital expenditure results, which have been brought out for the September quarter, showing that capital expenditure increased 2.3 per cent in the September quarter and is 14.4 per cent higher than a year ago. That is telling you that business is picking up investment and taking over to some degree from the housing sector. In addition to that, company profits released today show that gross operating profits increased 4.7 per cent in the September quarter and are up 17.8 per cent over the year. That is a very strong growth in company profits. Again, that bodes well for capital investment. If companies are profitable then they have investment opportunities, and investment will start to pick up some of the slack as the housing sector comes off.In addition, we had trade data for the month of October released today, showing some strengthening in capital imports. Overall, there was a trade deficit of $926 million, with exports rising 1.8 per cent and imports rising 1.5 per cent. So notwithstanding a difficult international situation and drought, the news in relation to October is that exports were up. However, I should make this point: rural goods exports showed an increase in prices, whereas rural goods volumes, as shown by the September quarter, are down. That is telling you that, as rural goods production contracts, those that are still able to sell overseas are getting better prices - but the volumes are contracting. We expect that the effects of drought will continue to keep those volumes down through the course of 2002-03, with the current account deficit rising to above four per cent, as we put in the mid-year forecast.It is a difficult international environment and it is a very severe drought. The drought is affecting Australian growth. The good news is that the budget remains in sound shape, with a moderate surplus forecast for 2002-03. According to international forecasts, Australia is forecast to perform better than the developed economies of the world in 2002-03. Notwithstanding our own difficulties, the Australian economy remains one of the most resilient of the developed world. Unlike previous international downturns, we managed to avoid recession in 2001 and keep people in work.What does this mean for the average person? The average person has been able to have much better job opportunities than they did during previous international downturns - in, say, the recession of 1990: remember when all those people were put out of work by the Keating high unemployment regime. We have not been affected by that. - If strong economic policy can continue, we can keep more Australians in work and avoid the kind of tragedy that the member for Blaxland's predecessor inflicted on the Australian economy back in 1990.</DOC>

I would add that in relation to capital gains tax it is my understanding that one of the properties in question was purchased before capital gains tax legislation came into effect. As to the other matters, I am not aware of any arrangement to avoid tax. If there were any arrangement to avoid tax, and I was satisfied of that, I would take appropriate action. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I can inform him that the government has strengthened Australia's health system immeasurably with the measures that it has put in place, including the private health insurance rebate. The private health insurance rebate gives all Australians a 30 per cent rebate on their private health insurance - that is how it strengthens Australia's health system. As a consequence of that, nearly nine million Australians now have private health cover, and each and every one of them enjoys the benefit of a 30 per cent rebate. The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that in 2000-01 public hospital admissions fell nationally by 0.1 per cent but private hospital admissions rose by a massive 12.1 per cent. So people had the opportunity to take out private health insurance, private health insurance admissions rose and the burden which would otherwise have fallen on the public health system has been minimised.This government has strongly supported moves to restore private health insurance cover levels because of the benefits that brings, not just to those who have private health insurance but to those who are relying on the public health system as well. We thought that was the policy of the Labor Party. That is what we thought. At the time of the last election the member for Jagajaga, then health spokesman, said this:Labor will retain the 30 per cent rebate, without a means test or cap.That would be pretty obvious, wouldn't it? On 5 February this year, the Leader of the Opposition said this:We have said that this is now a large part of people's budgets and we went to the last election retaining the private health rebate. We won't be changing that.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 5 February 2002 on the AM program. Yet the old flip-flop that you start to see of the Labor Party began on Sunday as the Leader of the Opposition began softening up the public for a massive tax increase. Let us be clear about this: wiping out the private health insurance rebate is a massive tax increase on the ordinary people of Australia and particularly the elderly. We had the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party today in the Canberra Times:'It is a huge area of expenditure and a lot of people are figuring out that it isn't worth having,' she said.On the John Laws program this morning, the shadow minister for health rang in to start attacking the private health insurance rebate. And at last Friday's Commonwealth-state health ministers meeting, every one of the Labor health ministers called for the abolition of the private health insurance rebate. We know, even if they will not say it, that the socialists on the Labor side of the parliament are itching to take away the private health insurance rebate which gives ordinary Australians the opportunity to take out private health insurance.I want to say this to the people of Australia, particularly the struggling families and the elderly: if you are taking out a Medibank Private Healthy Plus policy, Labor's policy means an increase in your premium of $638 a year. How many people would be forced out of private health insurance as a consequence of that? If you are taking out the Advantage Plus policy, Labor's policy means an increase in your private health insurance of $989 a year. And if you were taking out the Premier Plus, like many families throughout Australia, Labor policy now wants to take away from you $1,272, as a 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.Why is that Labor Party policy? It is not about helping families. It is not about helping the aged. It is all about ideology. What Labor does not want to see is people given money to have choice in their health care arrangements, to have the opportunity to take out private health insurance. This government introduced the private health insurance rebate. When you were within the sniff of an election, you said that you supported it: the Labor Party never supported it, and the Labor Party now has a plan to slug the families of Australia with increasing health costs by taking between $600 and $1,200 away from them. We say to the people of Australia: the coalition will stand up for you and the coalition will oppose Labor's attempt to hike taxes and to take money from struggling families. </DOC>

 - I would have to look again at the declaration she made before answering that question in full, and I will do that. I do not have the declaration with me. I do, however, understand that the only property - this is what I have been informed -  owned by Senator Coonan in New South Wales is her home in Woollahra. I am advised that the property in Clareville is not a property which has Senator Coonan's name on the title. That is my understanding, Mr Speaker. -  - I am glad that members of the opposition invest me with a capacity to carry in my mind the details of every title deed in New South Wales. I am flattered beyond belief that the members of the opposition think I can do that. I will have another look at her declaration and, if there is anything I should add, I will.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We have been pursuing quite a bold and aggressive program of aviation reforms, and a key element of that is airspace reform. Whilst it has been acknowledged that in Australia for many years we have had the best upper level airspace system in the world, it is also the case that in relation to low level airspace there is room for improvement in Australia. Properly carried forth, those reforms can produce improved safety outcomes and a more economically competitive environment, particularly for light aviation, and we want to see light aviation in Australia continue to grow and to enjoy better growth prospects, frankly, than perhaps has been the case in recent years.We are seeking to reform the present system in a way that will make it easier to use, reduce costs for the industry and for the travelling public, and at the same time maintain the highest possible safety standards. To progress this, I established a special aviation reform group, comprising the chairman of CASA, Ted Anson; the chairman of Airservices Australia, John Forsyth; the secretary of my department; the head of the Air Force, Air Marshal Angus Houston; and Mr Dick Smith. They have been reporting on how best to harmonise Australia's airspace arrangements with best international practice, and it has been an engaging process. -  - I am glad that the opposition is so interested and supportive. The group reported at the end of March and recommended the adoption of the American national airspace system, NAS. On 13 May the government considered it and agreed with the recommendation. We set up an implementation group. That is well and truly under way, established and operating out of Fairbairn with the cooperation and help of Defence. The implementation of NAS will proceed in three stages. I am delighted to be able to say that the first two elements of stage 1 took effect on 28 November. We are now formally embarked on airspace reform in Australia. The third element, which will involve new procedures for the climb into E airspace will be introduced in March 2003. The aviation reform group is currently finalising the timing for stages 2 and 3, and I expect to be advised shortly in relation to this. That is only one element of our aviation reform program. A couple of weeks ago I announced major changes in relation to CASA that will involve the establishment of a regulatory reform task force and new, enhanced and fairer enforcement procedures which have been very widely welcomed by industry. I welcome that. They have been welcomed too, I think, by CASA, recognising that they will improve relationships between the regulator and the aviation industry and the players in it. I note too, and welcome, the opposition's support.We are also moving to corporatise Airservices Australia, which, incidentally, has just announced a cut in the costs of its services, a welcome boost to aviation at a time when it needs all the competitive pressures being brought to bear that are possible. That, incidentally, amounts to a very significant real reduction in its charges over recent years - always something to be glad of. So there is a lot happening in aviation. We have a very forward looking reform agenda, but I am particularly pleased to be able to tell the House that airspace reform - long needed, in my view, in this country - is now under way and cannot be stopped.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. -  - The Leader of the Opposition was warned off the hustings in Victoria because he is electoral poison! - I thank the member for Moore for his question. - In answer to the member for Moore's excellent question, let me tell the House that construction on the Burrup Peninsula is essential for the success of the North West Shelf gas project, and this project in turn has enabled Australia to win a $25 billion gas sale to China. - Unfortunately, work at various sites on the Burrup Peninsula is now being plagued by a series of wildcat strikes organised by a Western Australian CFMEU official, Joe McDonald, who has had his federal right of entry permit revoked by a full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission and who has recently been convicted and fined for breaches of the freedom of association laws. Joe McDonald has been warned off by Woodside, who are the promoters of the North West Shelf gas project, he has been warned off by the Western Australian state police and, most significantly, he has even been warned off by his own union colleagues. Let me quote the Western Australian president of the AMWU, Colin Saunders, who says:Joe's trying to get on the Burrup, but all he is doing is certainly costing workers a lot of money for no result. My other concern is investors may think twice about the Burrup now and I guess that is why Woodside, given the CFMEU's track record, didn't entertain them being on site.Glen Anderton from the AWU said:The CFMEU is certainly trying to force its way onto the Burrup. If they get onto the site - and that is what worries all the companies up there - they would run amok.On this subject, I am very happy to form a unity ticket with the AMWU and the AWU. CFMEU officials like Joe McDonald and Kevin Reynolds are dinosaurs from the Dark Ages, and they should not be allowed to jeopardise Australian jobs and Australia export projects. Joe McDonald is now trying to gain, under state law, the right of entry permit that he has been appropriately denied under federal law. The federal government will continue to intervene to ensure the primacy of the federal law when it is challenged by state laws and state governments.</DOC>

 - I am not familiar with all the details of the reports that the member for Lalor refers to. I have found on a number of occasions that HREOC has reported on matters of detention, and that the commissioner in relation to those matters has indicated he has a view about detention and detention policy and is of the view that mandatory detention ought not to be part of the regime that is in place to deal with unauthorised arrivals. For that reason, I have found, in relation to many of the claims that are made about detention issues, that people who have some very strong views about detention policy often allow it to affect their judgments. I simply make that point. - There is a proper procedure for responding to the reports from the commission. We will be involved in responding appropriately, but we have not found, in relation to these matters, any proper basis for reflection either on the policy that we implement in these matters or on the way in which it should be conducted. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I acknowledge his interest in the opportunities we are trying to create for Australian exporters, particularly agricultural exporters. One of our very strong hopes and policy positions with regard to the multilateral trade negotiations that are being undertaken is that we can significantly improve the circumstances for Australia's farmers in getting access to the markets of the world. One of the issues that needed to be addressed early on in this round and that still needs to be addressed is that of access to much-needed medicines for epidemics in the developing world. On 14 and 15 November, I chaired an informal mini ministerial meeting of the WTO, in Sydney. It was a great success because we made significant progress in creating a framework that will enable the poor countries of the world to get affordable access to these much-needed medicines. Whilst it focused on a large number of purely economic issues within the WTO, it also focused on what I termed the `moral obligations' of the developed world to look after the interests of the developing world in this regard. Twenty-five countries were represented at the meeting, representing about 80 per cent of global trade. The meeting was very successful in that it moved a long way towards developing a framework that will enable countries like Lesotho, in southern Africa, to get affordable access to medicines, particularly for HIV-AIDS. In that country, 31 per cent of the population between the ages of 15 and 25 suffer from HIV-AIDS. It was part of the mandate from Doha that this year the WTO address this issue. Certainly, the meeting in Sydney went a long way towards doing that.Going to the member for Wannon's question, it is important to unlock the door to the next stage of substantive negotiations next year on market access for agriculture. We had a lengthy discussion at the meeting about the range of market access with regard to agriculture, industrial goods and services. We heard for the first time at that meeting that the Japanese delegation intended to make public on 18 November their position on agriculture, which they did. The European Union delegation indicated for the first time, at that meeting, that they also would endeavour to put down publicly their position on agriculture by the end of this year. The meeting was a great success in keeping the momentum moving forward. As far as the negotiations are concerned, it is our No. 1 trade policy priority to achieve an outcome in this round. The series of mini ministerial meetings, of which Sydney was the third, have all been extremely successful in continuing to maintain that momentum, particularly in areas of interest to Australia.The meeting in Sydney was particularly unusual in that it focused on what I call a moral issue rather than a pure economic issue, which is to help developing countries in the area of access to medicines. It is a very complicated process of waiving intellectual property rights for those medicines where the intellectual property rights are held by the wealthy, developed countries, particularly the United States and the European Union. Those who attended from the developing countries went away feeling very comfortable that something was going to be done within this economic forum about their dilemma and their concerns. I recently received a letter from the European Union Trade Commissioner, Pascal Lamy, who attended the meeting. It states, in part:Dear Mark,Just a short note to thank you very much for organising a successful mini ministerial. We really managed to open up all the issues in a relatively short space of time in a productive way and we passed the acid test. The outcome, particularly on access to medicines, gave the system more energy and has materially advanced the round.That is proof positive of the role that Australia plays in this multilateral forum in moving forward this process that will, in the end, significantly benefit Australia's producers, farmers and exporters. It will also significantly benefit the developing countries that need and are entitled to better access to world markets, as are Australian farmers and producers. Again, Australia continues to lead the way in its engagement and involvement in this multilateral system and in ensuring that it achieves those goals. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. The honourable member for Perth's response to the health system in Australia is to slug those Australian families who have taken out private health insurance an additional $600 to $1,200 per year. Let us look at what that means and start with the figures for private health insurance in the member for Perth's electorate. - On the latest figures I have available to me, there are some 35,000 people affected in the member for Perth's electorate. The member for Perth is promising them a tough slug of between $600 and $1,200 a year. That is your promise! Let us go to the Leader of the Opposition. There are almost 30,000 people affected in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham. He wants to slug them an average of $800 as his response to health in Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, has over 35,000 people in her electorate. - Mr Speaker, let me give you a couple more examples of the Labor Party's response. The member for Brand, for example -  - This is entirely relevant. The Labor Party's response to the matters that were raised by the member for Perth is to slug every Australian family with private health insurance somewhere between $600 and $1,200. The member for Lilley is on his feet. I think there are about 30,000 in your electorate. - What I can say is that the level of bulk-billing in Australia is higher now than it was for the average of the Labor years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I can indicate to him and to the House that last week the government announced the allocation of 6,561 new aged care places at a cost of $144 million in additional recurrent funding. This brings the number of aged care places that have been allocated over the last four years by this government to 44,112. For the member for Barker's electorate, there was an allocation of an additional 74 residential aged care places at a cost of an additional $1.7 million in recurrent funding. His electorate will also benefit from an additional $1.8 million in capital funding - indeed, 50 per cent of all of the places allocated last week were allocated to aged care facilities in rural areas. These included the honourable member for Dawson's electorate; the electorate of the honourable member for Indi; the electorate of Corangamite, which includes Torquay, Ocean Grove and other towns; and the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Places were also allocated to aged care facilities in metropolitan electorates such as Cook, Dunkley, Aston, Moore and right throughout Australia. - . The member for McMillan has received places for Trafalgar. The member for Corio -  - What this indicates is that the government is on track to meet its target of providing 200,000 aged care places in Australia by 2006. In addition to this 6,500 there will be an additional 1,500 places allocated for innovative trials for extended aged care in the home for multipurpose services and for other allocations. This stands in stark contrast to the 10,000-bed shortfall which we inherited from the Australian Labor Party in 1996. Indeed, expenditure on residential aged care has increased under this government from $2.5 billion to over $4.3 billion, a 68 per cent increase. It also stands in stark contrast to what the state and territory governments have done with public hospital beds. Over the period when we have seen a 26 or 27 per cent increase in residential aged care beds there has been a 22 per cent reduction in the number of public hospital beds. In fact, 14,000 public hospital beds have been taken out of the system by state and territory governments in just over a decade. We are on track, as I said, to achieve a target of 200,000 aged care beds for older Australians. This is one of the ways this government is dealing with the ageing of the population. </DOC>

 - I note that on radio this morning the honourable member for Perth said that the Labor Party would remove $64 million from health funding. I indicate to the House that this funding includes programs such as the Quit Smoking Program, and the diabetes and heart disease management programs.  - Is the honourable member for Perth saying to Australians that these worthwhile programs -  - which are aimed at ameliorating and overcoming chronic illness within our community, would be slashed by the Labor Party? So on top of the $600 to $1,200 tax slug that the Labor Party is now promising via private health insurance abolition, we now have the abolition of the Quit Smoking, diabetes and heart disease management programs. Is that a responsible health policy? </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. As a representative of one of the major wheat-growing areas in Australia, his region, amongst many others, is experiencing the impact of significantly reduced yields. Indeed, ABARE in its crop forecast released this morning has confirmed the impact of the substantially reduced winter rainfall. That impact on Australia's winter grain crop will be to essentially halve the available grain harvested this year. The wheat crop will be less than 10 million tonnes, compared with 24 million tonnes last season; barley is down about 60 per cent, to three million tonnes; canola is forecast at 0.7 million tonnes, a decrease of 0.9 million tonnes from last year; and lupins are also down very substantially. These figures confirm recent reports by ABARE that we will have a very small winter grain crop for the 2002-03 harvest. The ABARE forecast this morning also provided some initial data about the projections for the northern summer cropping region. It is clear also now that the absence of early summer rains is having an impact on the potential for our summer cropping prospects for the season ahead. The estimates from ABARE are that the cotton area sown will be down about 45 per cent, that rice will be down 70 per cent, and that there will be very significant reductions in summer grain production. It is still possible that it could rain in time for some of this crop to be planted, but the prospects of having a good summer harvest now are obviously a matter of concern. Today I am hosting a meeting of the Feed Grains Roundtable, which includes participants from the grain supply sector, and also those users of grain such as the feedlotters, those who use grain as emergency feed during dry times and others who have links with the industry. The roundtable will look at issues of supply and demand. We have, from the estimates of ABARE, sufficient grain being produced in Australia to meet the feed needs but a lot of it will not be conveniently located, and obviously the cost will be quite substantial. From an economic perspective it is sometimes better to export our high value prime hard wheats and look at whether we may be able to source cheaper feed grains in other parts of the world. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has issued permits for the imports of some grain into Australia and there is anticipation that there may be some shipments arriving early next year.  I want to emphasise, however - and assure the honourable member - that, in allowing grain imports, the government will not compromise quarantine standards. We are not prepared to in any way adjust our scientific rationale. We are not prepared to make concessions that might put at risk the pest and disease free status of our grain industry. Grain, on arrival, will essentially have to be denatured, if it is not denatured before departure, so that any risk of weeds or pests coming into this country on the seed can therefore be discounted. But it will be a very high priority for us, in an environment where feed imports may be necessary, to ensure that our quarantine standards are in no way compromised. This is a difficult year for Australian farmers. It has obviously been difficult for the grain industry because of lost production. That has an impact then on the users of grain in Australia. Their costs will be higher. The government is seeking to assist wherever it can. Ultimately I hope that today's meeting will help to put some degree of balance into the debate and help people to a better understanding about where grain can be sourced to meet their needs over the months ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. As to the precise figures he quoted, I will have to check the detail. I do not have that at my fingertips. Earlier, the member for Perth waved around a graph in relation to bulk-billing. I have had the opportunity to look at a graph of bulk-billing since 1984. If one wants to look at a graph in relation to the history of bulk-billing, then one finds that we are back down to under 50 per cent and that we have had a substantial increase in bulk-billing. As I said earlier, the rate of bulk-billing today in Australia is still well above the average of the rate in the years in which the Labor Party was in government. What the government is doing is, more importantly, in relation to the distribution of doctors. For example, the number of doctors practising in rural and remote areas has increased from 5,700 in 1997-98 to 6,363 in 2000-01. It is these real, practical measures to get more doctors into the system - one which you allowed to run down whilst you were in government - and not the tax increases you are proposing for the health system that are going to work in terms of providing and continuing to provide good quality health care to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. This government is putting in place the most effective regime to protect heritage of national significance that Australia has seen. - Unfortunately, this country inherited no regime to protect heritage of national significance from the 13 years of Labor government. In fact, Labor left this country in a situation where, if you wanted to protect national heritage, you had to go to the United Nations in order to get approval for it to be classified as World Heritage. There was no regime whatsoever to protect national heritage. Our national heritage is a key part of our national identity and, through our heritage, all Australians can gain a better sense of who they are as a people and of the nature of the journey they have travelled as a nation.I was very pleased to announce yesterday some $3.6 million in grants to help protect and preserve Australia's nationally significant cultural heritage places, as we undertook to do in the last election campaign. Some 64 projects around Australia will receive grants under the 2002 round of the Howard government's Cultural Heritage Projects Program. One example of these grants is in the electorate of the member for Macquarie. He would have been pleased to see that some $99,000 will be used to undertake restoration of three stained glass windows at historic St Matthew's Anglican Church. This church was built by Francis Greenway, the convict architect and architect of some of our most important early public buildings. I announced these grants at Quamby Homestead in Hagley, Tasmania, where $90,000 was provided under the program to undertake structural conservation works. Quamby was the home of the Irishman Richard Dry, whose son was part of the Patriotic Six who brought an end to transportation to Tasmania. Preservation of these very significant parts of our national heritage is helping young Australians learn the democratic story of this country, the various stages of the development of this country and how Australian democracy was built. By contrast, the Labor Party has not only left us with no regime to protect national heritage but has opposed the government's attempt to put in place the strongest regime to protect national heritage that this country has seen. The Labor Party has given in to noisy pressure groups. - It has not consulted with any of those who really value Australia's national heritage. The member for Wills should be grateful that the government has saved him from the embarrassment of putting forward the most absurd set of amendments to legislation in the heritage area that we have seen. These were amendments that ignored existing sections and that would have made the act totally unworkable. If they had been passed, they would have shown that the Labor Party still has no credibility -  - in the protection of Australia's national heritage. It is this government which has put forward the legislation and the program to protect the heritage which symbolises to Australians the great democratic story that this nation has engaged in. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The offer that has been made by the Commonwealth represents a very significant advance on the existing arrangements. The new disability agreements have yet to be concluded because Senator Vanstone on our behalf has thus far not been able to obtain from the states an indication of how they will augment their contribution. As soon as that occurs, we can together move forward to provide more resources in relation to unmet need. I remind the honourable member that back in 1992, I think, an agreement was concluded between the former Commonwealth government and the state governments whereby employment services for people with disabilities were taken over by the Commonwealth and accommodation and other services were taken over by the states on the understanding that the Commonwealth would make a contribution of something I think - do not hold me to the exact figure - in the order of 20 per cent of the operating costs. That was an agreement that was made - and I am not criticising it - between the Keating government and the various state governments. Subsequent to that there have been, I think, two unmet need amounts contributed by the Commonwealth. We also put on the table recently a percentage increase on the existing funds and we have asked the states to let us know what they are willing also to put on the table. That is the situation. When they are forthcoming, we can move forward together, and I think that is what the Australian people want.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I recognise the interest he has shown in this issue and, of course, it is one of particular interest to his constituents, given the geography of the electorate of Kalgoorlie. Australia has clearly developed an effective approach to stopping unauthorised boat arrivals reaching our shores. After all, no boat has landed on the Australian mainland since, I think, August 2001. The government's tough approach is working because we have taken difficult decisions at the domestic and international levels, which are putting Australian national interests first. Our commitment to the processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, to mandatory detention in Australia, to a strong legislative framework and to enhanced regional cooperation are all aimed at sending the strongest possible message to the people smugglers that Australia is closed for business. Australia has maintained the momentum from the very important Bali regional ministerial conference in February 2002 - a meeting which was cohosted by Australia and Indonesia. Australia's ambassador for people-smuggling is helping to continue to drive the Bali process forward. He participated in two regional meetings last month, which have been focusing on public awareness campaigns, legislative development and law enforcement activities. One of the meetings on information sharing was coordinated by Japan on 14 November. Australia and Indonesia cochaired a steering committee meeting in Bangkok on 18 November. A meeting of a Bali working group, which was chaired by Thailand, met in Shenzhen in China on 25 November to discuss law enforcement coordination. My point is that the Bali process has led to substantial and ongoing momentum right across the region in addressing this question of people-smuggling and, of course, that is having an effect. It has already led to a number of countries in our region strengthening their responses to people-smuggling. I know the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would be interested in a couple of examples. Pakistan, for example, which is a major source country, recently criminalised people-smuggling. Australian officials completed a scoping study in Cambodia, enabling Cambodia to criminalise people-smuggling in its domestic legislation during next year. We are also working closely with Papua New Guinea on its review of its immigration legislation to include the crime of people-smuggling. Indonesia is also preparing legislative proposals to make people-smuggling a criminal offence, which I understand will be considered by the Indonesian parliament early in 2003.With all of this momentum in addressing the question of people-smuggling, it is worth noting that in April of next year we will yet again be cohosting with Indonesia a further Bali conference, a ministerial conference of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, not just to review what we have achieved since the original Bali conference in February of this year but also to see whether there are still further measures that we can take to guarantee that the efforts that we are very much driving through the region, but with the assistance of a number of other countries, continue to be successful and that people-smuggling is stamped out.</DOC>

 - Let me say at the outset that the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition did improperly and without foundation impute tax avoidance to Senator Coonan and her husband. On the evidence available to me, that is an unfounded allegation and the Leader of the Opposition should have done the proper thing and moved a substantive motion. I have followed this debate carefully, and there are quite a lot of completely unfounded allegations being flung around, not only by the Leader of the Opposition. At least he has sought the cover of parliamentary privilege, which is more than the member for Werriwa did in the interview that he gave this morning, when he said:This is not a case of forgetting to do the tax return; it is a case of avoiding the tax return. They have gone out of their way to make a false declaration of where they live, for the purpose of avoiding land taxes. How can she go on as a federal minister for taxation under those circumstances?As the Leader of the Opposition would well know, you are liable to pay capital gains tax when you realise the capital gain. You do not pay the capital gains tax when you acquire the property. It may have escaped him.  - No, it is your law, because you were a member of the government that passed it. What happens with capital gains tax - just so that you understand this, in case you ask any more questions - is that you pay tax on the capital gain. You realise a gain when you sell a property that you have bought earlier. - I am just stating what the law is. That statement was made on the information then available to me. Mr Rogers has made a statement about the date of the purchase. It is his property - it is not mine, and it is not his wife's property - so of course he would know about it. But it does not alter the fundamental fact that you do not incur a liability for capital gains tax until you actually sell the property. Let me again say that unfounded allegations have been made, this time under the cover of parliamentary privilege. People are being accused of tax avoidance and of making false declarations. I invite the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Werriwa to provide the evidence of the false electoral enrolment declaration. Where is the evidence of that? It is fundamental to the case being made against Senator Coonan, which is that, in some way, a bodgie application was made and it was witnessed by Senator Coonan. Where is the evidence of that?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I acknowledge his real interest in this matter as he seeks to secure adequate health provision in places like Gympie, along the Queensland coast, which I have visited with him. I believe that we have put in place a substantial and very worthwhile set of measures to try to address in a concrete and workable way the problem of health delivery in rural and regional areas. The Regional Health Strategy provided just under $600 million, and this has since been topped up with more money. This will help in the area of allied health, particularly nursing, and it will help to get more doctors, health professionals and specialists into country areas. It constitutes the largest injection ever made by a Commonwealth government into rural health.Under this program there are now 10 university departments of rural health, and no fewer than nine clinical schools have been established in regional locations. I have had the opportunity to visit many of them around the country. They are enormously appreciated by people in those regions, and they are making a big difference. Students in rural areas now have the chance to study in or near their home towns. This network also introduces quite a number of urban students to the challenges and benefits of rural practice, and it introduces them to the joys of country living.Since 1996 we have also seen a huge uptake in rural scholarship schemes. In 1996 there were just 150 rural scholarships undertaken in medicine. By 2002 this had increased to 2,400, which is a massive rise. That includes scholarships for medicine, nursing and pharmacy. It is important to recognise that it is generally accepted that rural students are somewhere around nine times more likely to practise a profession like medicine in a country area than a city based student is to move to the country. In 1996 only eight per cent of the intake of students to our medical schools were from rural areas. It is now running at 25 per cent. We are encouraging young doctors by giving financial incentives in return for rural service - for example, under the HECS reimbursement scheme, medical graduates who are willing to commit to rural practice will have part of their HECS debt reimbursed for each year of service in a designated rural area. Private health cover is very important to people in country Australia, just as it is to those in urban Australia. Some nine million Australians are now covered by private health insurance. The private health insurance rebate is the cornerstone of policies that have relieved pressure on Medicare and our public hospital systems. The government wants to ensure that people in rural areas continue to have access to rural private health hospitals and to have incentives to purchase private health insurance.This is not so of those opposite. They went to last year's election promising the electorate that they would retain the rebate in full. But now the Leader of the Opposition is openly canvassing the prospect of scrapping it. Their alternative proposal, as best we can read it, would punish families who have taken out private health insurance by requiring them to pay between $600 and $1,200 more. Particularly in the context of the drought, that is something that a lot of rural and regional Australians just could not afford. If Labor have their way, it will become more difficult for people in country areas with private health cover to visit a doctor, a specialist or a physiotherapist or to purchase new glasses. The fact is that many specialised treatments for rural people are available only in major centres. This is often easily overlooked.Private health insurance gives rural people access to the doctors of their choice and reasonable security in relation to treatment on time, given that that treatment often involves considerable travel and logistical difficulty. Both are very important to people in rural Australia. Rural and regional Australians need to and want to - and I believe should have the right to - choose their own doctor and when and where they will have elective treatment. Private health insurance is a vital mechanism to help them secure that. Labor wants to take it away from them. That is an appalling policy that ought to be condemned by all rural Australians who depend on private health cover.</DOC>

 - I have forgotten what the question was now - oh, I know; do not remind me. It was about allegations of transgressions by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer which, on the information available to me, are completely false. I start by quietly making a point that I think is very fundamental to this whole discussion, and that is that the Clareville property has never been owned by Senator Coonan, nor to my understanding has a beneficial interest in that property of any kind ever been in the hands of Senator Coonan. It is her husband's property. I thought that in Australia in 2002 it was a fairly well-accepted principle of public life - and one endorsed by the Australian Labor Party - that two successful professional people could have separate assets, pursue their own careers and be married without what one does being dragged into the activities and affairs of the other. I thought that was a principle that all of those strident feminists on the other side of this parliament would have supported.But apparently not. Apparently, because Senator Coonan's husband owns a property, it is also Senator Coonan's property. I am very surprised; in fact, I am sore amazed at this departure by the Australian Labor Party from such a principle. I have been reading all of this 30th anniversary stuff about how whoever was elected Prime Minister 30 years ago heralded a new era in relation to the equal rights of men and women. What we are having in this parliament from the Labor Party is a massive retreat from that principle. Let me develop this theme. Here is Senator Coonan, who has completely independent assets. Let me read something very instructive that is entirely relevant to the false accusations that have been made against Senator Coonan. I will read from her husband's statement in relation to the Clareville property, which was issued last night:In 1979 I purchased a run-down cottage at 16 Paradise Avenue, Clareville. I acquired the property through a company, Karnick Trustees, named after my two daughters. This all occurred prior to my marriage to Helen. Subsequently, well prior to the introduction of the capital gains tax in 1985, the beneficial interest was transferred to me - transferred to Andrew Rogers; not to Andrew Rogers and Helen Coonan, but to Andrew Rogers. The old house was demolished and a new house was erected on the site. The property is owned by me, and at no time has Helen had any proprietary interest in it. I make the first point, and it is very important: any suggestion of any kind of land tax liability - and I will come to the question of land tax liability in a moment - in relation to the property in Clareville is palpably false and could only be entertained in the mind of a person who is so out of touch with modern Australia as to assume that, if you own a property, half of it is automatically owned by your husband or wife. That is no longer the case in every situation in Australia, and I would have thought those great supporters of feminism, those great supporters of the independent rights of people, on the other side would have been outraged at any suggestion to that effect. He goes on to say:At the time of our marriage, each of us had prior families and responsibilities to them and each of us had various assets which we have retained as separate property. Other Australian families are similarly placed.He goes on to describe the erection of the new house:In September 1999, Helen decided to renovate her home in Woollahra. I have no proprietary interest in her property. Because extensive renovations were required, we moved to my house at Clareville. It was originally envisaged that this would be a relatively short period of full-time residence while renovations were completed. Renovations in fact took longer than expected and significant defects are still to be rectified.He then goes on to describe his own movements and says he:... regarded Clareville as my principal place of residence. I transferred my electoral enrolment to there in 2001.An issue has arisen regarding the witnessing of the application for the electoral enrolment. I table the application signed by Andrew Rogers to transfer his enrolment to Pittwater. As best I can read it, it was witnessed by Bronwyn Louise Reis of 11/29 Rangers Road, Neutral Bay. That does not sound very much like a Helen Coonan to me, but I may be wrong. We have been talking about dodgy enrolments, and the only reason I could not do this yesterday is that the privacy laws of the Commonwealth meant that the person who signed this application had to authorise the Electoral Commissioner to make it available to third parties, including the Prime Minister. For completeness of the record, I also table a copy of the application to transfer from Pittwater to Woollahra. That is signed by Andrew John Rogers and is witnessed by, as best I can read it, Ross McInnes of 1 O'Connell Street, Sydney, New South Wales. That is not very much like Helen Coonan either. So much for the great conspiracy.Let me now deal with the second count in the declaration. That relates to allegations concerning the avoidance of land tax on the Clareville property. Mr Rogers, in his statement yesterday, explained the circumstances in relation to that, including, quite properly, the payment of the land tax in relation to the recent year. A letter Andrew Rogers has written today to the Office of State Revenue reads as follows:Following upon my letter to you, assessment dated 22 November 2002 was issued which was paid on 2 December 02 to the ANZ Bank Rose Bay. - We have made a great discovery! Yesterday was 2 December. That is wonderful! Maybe they will have a policy tomorrow. The letter goes on:As you are no doubt aware the issue of my land tax payments has become a matter of great political controversy.Andrew has a very good sense of humour. He is a lot more tolerant of this lot opposite than many other people would be. He goes on to say:Please let me know if there is any issue of concern to your office and whether I can be of any assistance in resolving it.I table that letter as well. That is not the letter of a person who has done anything wrong. It is not the letter of a person who wants to avoid anything. The only people who are guilty of anything in this parliament are the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa and others who have falsely impugned the reputation of decent, successful Australians.  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I inform him and the House that Australians, and in particular working Australian families, have taken up the government's private health insurance initiatives with considerable enthusiasm. The September 2002 quarter figures show that over 8.7 million people, some 44 per cent of the Australian population, have private health insurance for hospital cover. This 8.7 million Australians is an increase of 4,000 on the previous quarter. You can compare these figures with the same quarter in September 1999, when just under 5.9 million people or 30.9 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. So in this three-year period we have had a substantial increase from 5.9 million to 8.7 million Australians covered by private health insurance. What this indicates is that working Australian families in particular - because over five million of the 8.7 million people covered were covered by a family policy - are exercising their freedom to choose private health cover.Singles have also taken up private health insurance strongly, with some 618,000 more people covered by singles policies since September 1999. This is a demonstration of the success of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, Lifetime Health Cover and the no gaps policy of this government. This is borne out by statistics in relation to private hospital admissions. According to figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, private hospital admissions in 2001 had grown by 12 per cent and, by contrast, public hospital admissions fell by 0.1 per cent the previous year. So Australians continue to benefit from greater choice and stronger private health insurance.The member for Boothby asked me whether or not there are any alternative policies. Of course, we know that the opposition, the Australian Labor Party, views the 30 per cent rebate with disdain. Earlier this year we had the shadow minister for health, the member for Perth, describe the 30 per cent rebate as a public policy crime. Indeed, we have been waiting for a year for a policy from the Labor opposition, and the first policy we get is an indication that the Labor Party will abolish the rebate. That means imposing a tax slug on Australians of up to $1,200 a year. This is what the Labor Party wants to do: to impose a tax slug on those 8.7 million Australians who currently have private health insurance, which will be between $600 and $1,200 a year, by abolishing the 30 per cent policy. Of course, this includes the five million people who are covered by those policies that go to families. What we have is not only a tax slug on Australians generally but a tax slug which goes to ordinary Australian families. The Labor Party does not care about making the health care system affordable for working families; that is not part of what it intends to do. It simply wants to go back to its ideological view of a socialised health system. It does not want working families to have choice - and that, of course, would be a real public policy crime.</DOC>

 - I do not have any information about those invoices and, if there is anything that I should tell the parliament after I obtain information about those invoices, I will do so. But, can I suggest, with respect not only to the member for Werriwa but to the other members of the opposition who are pursuing this matter, that the company, Endispute, was a company in which Senator Coonan had an interest which she disposed of after she became a minister. She disposed of two of her -  - The member for Werriwa interrupts, `Did she?' She transferred the interest to her son, and her son is not a dependant. Have we now reached a situation where independent children of ministers are now dragged into disputes? According to the opposition, everybody is fair game. The husband or the wife is fair game -  - I was making the point, Mr Speaker, that the minister, when she became a minister, in accordance with the guidelines looked to her situation and disposed of the interest she had. - I was making the point in answer to what I thought was an interjection from the member for Werriwa. Sometimes because of my slightly defective hearing I do not get things right, but I thought he said, `Did she?'Government members - He did. - The more acute hearing of people on the front bench confirms that he did say that. I was merely making the point that, yes, she transferred to her adult son. That is perfectly permissible. Let me read the relevant guideline:Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments, and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty ... Ministers are required to divest themselves, or relinquish control, of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a spouse or dependent family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.I have been advised by my department, and it is, on the information available publicly, manifestly the case, that as Endispute was not involved in the area of Senator Coonan's ministerial responsibilities and that in any event her son is not dependent - I understand he is a fully employed lawyer, of some 25 or 26 years, and clearly is not dependent on his mother or on Mr Rogers - there has been no breach of the ministerial guidelines. Basically, this is an allegation that in some way the minister has behaved in a fashion which has either breached the guidelines or been improper. She has not breached the guidelines. There is no evidence that she has been involved in any tax avoidance practices. There is no evidence that her husband has been involved in any tax avoidance practices. But let me say this - and this really gets back to the point I was making in an earlier answer: even if there were some suggestion regarding the conduct of her husband, is that automatically a disqualification? I thought we had a principle in this country now that married people who followed their own careers had a right to be treated on their own merits according to their own achievements. But apparently when it suits the professedly profeminist Labor Party they abandon that principle and it is perfectly okay to drag the husband in, to drag the wife in, to drag the children in. - The minister, on the information available to me and available publicly, has not been guilty of any breach of the ministerial guidelines. She has acknowledged an error in relation to the return that was put in to the Senate. - There are a lot of people on your side who have made typos, mate, so I would be very careful about running that! For two or three weeks we have had a concerted campaign on the part of the Labor Party to get Senator Coonan: that is what this has been all about. It has been a determined attempt and it has failed, because there is no evidence to support the allegation. It has been to besmirch her reputation by making allegations about her husband which are in any event false, making allegations about her professional conduct, dragging her adult children into it. This has just been an attempt, and there is no merit at all. To the charge that she has in some way breached the guidelines: there is no evidence of that - none whatsoever. To the charge that she has been involved in tax avoidance: there is no evidence of that. To the charge that her husband has been guilty of tax avoidance: on the information available to me there is no evidence to support that. Moreover, Andrew Rogers, Senator Coonan's husband, has indicated a willingness to provide any information to the state Land Tax Commissioner. When you look at all of those facts and circumstances, what you have got is a miserable failure of a smear campaign against a decent minister in my government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I was hoping to see the policy today on issues relating to asylum questions, detention and related matters. I was hoping to welcome it as a positive contribution to debate. At least I know that it has been a positive contribution to debate. It appears to be primarily an issue that has not yet been resolved, but I am certainly prepared to assist, if I can, with some constructive comments that might aid those who are deliberating on these matters.One of the first observations I would make is that during the last election there was, I think, a good understanding within the Australian community that the government of Australia should be able to determine who is able to come to Australia and settle in Australia and be protected in Australia. I was surprised, therefore, to see that some people were toying with the idea of giving over the responsibility for making those decisions to another international agency - the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  - In relation to those who are here in Australia and in our territory where we have responsibility for those matters, we will not be ceding our responsibility or our sovereignty to any unelected and unaccountable body. I know at a time like this it is often easy to consider policy issues without any principal regard to the long-term and potential costs of those policies. I encourage those who are participating in any debate on these matters to have regard to some of those questions that they will have to look at at a later point in time when they are considering asking the Australian community to elect them.It seems to me that one of the major consequences of all the proposals they are looking at is that they are going to lead - as I think I saw expressed by a minister in the United Kingdom - to assistance for those people who would like to get asylum seekers on the gravy train for the legal profession. In fact I think the immigration minister, Lord Rooker, spoke of lawyers laughing all the way to the bank. What I can see in the proposals that are before us is the possibility for additional litigation arising out of a whole host of issues, particularly when you try to set artificial time limits as to how long people might be held with the potential for those matters to be litigated - and litigated not after 90 days but litigated after 120 days, 150 days or 180 days as you go through considering each of those issues.In fact, as I looked at the range of proposals it seemed to me that they were embarking upon initiatives that would enable Australia to be again targeted by those who want to exploit our generosity, our capacity to assist refugees and our capacity to assist the most vulnerable. The concerns that I have when you talk about releasing people promptly into the community, with only the most superficial judgments as to whether or not they have substantial claims, is that it is only going to bring about a situation where more people would seek to access Australia.If the Leader of the Opposition wants to see how those matters are operating abroad, he ought to spend a little more time with his mentor, Tony Blair, because I see that in the United Kingdom today it is reported that they are looking at 100,000 asylum seekers for the first time. Last year it was 92,000. The figure for nine months of this year has already reached 80,600. One of the issues that becomes very clear in relation to the United Kingdom is that, notwithstanding their advocacy for being able to remove as many as 30,000 people as rejected asylum seekers a year, they are now replacing the use of the words `30,000 asylum seekers' with `a greater proportion'. Why are they doing that? Because the best that they have been able to achieve is to remove 1,000 a month.That overseas performance in relation to these matters demonstrates that, when you have people who are not refugees free and at large in your community, they are not available for removal, they cannot be readily located, and that leads to more and more people seeking to arrive. I encourage those who are participating in the debate to listen carefully to comments such as those that I heard repeated again this morning on AM from the shadow minister for multicultural affairs. There is some good sense being spoken by some but there are some who are undermining, considerably, the position of Australia in relation to doing, I think, an outstanding job - something that I will deal with later today in a statement I am making - in demonstrating how you can manage your borders effectively, how you can maintain the integrity of your borders, and how you can enhance your capacity to assist the most vulnerable refugees in the world.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated, in answer to the first question, that I would seek information regarding those pieces of paper that were waved around by the member for Werriwa, and if there is anything that I should appropriately address to the House in supplementation to my answer I will do so. But he seems to have missed the point: there has clearly been no breach of the guidelines. - You can ask as many questions as you like. I am quite enjoying this question time. I would not stop asking questions. Please don't do that! Please don't stop asking me some questions. The point here is that the minister has been charged with all manner of things. She has been charged with breaching the guidelines - no evidence. She has been charged with tax avoidance - no evidence. Her husband has been charged with tax avoidance - absent is any implication of her in that claim. What that has to do with her ministerial duties, given the fact that they are independent professional people entitled to their own independent careers, completely escapes me; nonetheless, he has dealt with that. That has been dealt with. I say to the opposition that, if they have got evidence that she has broken the guidelines, that she has been guilty of tax avoidance or that he has been guilty of tax avoidance, I will examine it. As I indicated yesterday, if there is anything appropriate that ought to be done, it will be done. But the opposition has not made a case. This has all the hallmarks of a desperate smear campaign by an opposition that believes in nothing and has got no policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and recognise the interest she shows in these issues on behalf of her constituents. The British government has, in the last few hours, produced a damning report on the human rights record of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The dossier details the appalling record of human rights abuses by Saddam and those closest to him and sets out the terrifying nature of the regime - a regime that controls the only state in recent times to have used weapons of mass destruction against its own people and which survives through oppression and fear. The dossier quotes, among other things, estimates that over 100,000 Kurds were killed or disappeared during the 1987-88 Anfal by Saddam's forces against Kurdish insurgents, including through the use of chemical weapons. The dossier's contents do not come as a surprise to us. Australia has raised serious concerns about Iraq's human rights record in the past, including through co-sponsorship since 1991 of a resolution in the UN Commission on Human Rights expressing great concern over the Iraqi government's flagrant violation of the human rights of its own citizens. But the dossier does remind us of the cradle to grave regime of fear run by Saddam Hussein and his cohorts and that Iraq's abuses go well beyond his possession of weapons of mass destruction. Among other things, the dossier highlights the systematic, brutal repression of dissent. The report notes that official Iraqi instructions given to security forces on how to react to demonstrations were that 95 per cent of the demonstrators were to be killed and the remainder left for interrogation. It underlines the systematic, almost bureaucratic, use of torture. In mid-2000, the regime issued a decree approving amputation of the tongue as a penalty for slander against the president or his family. The dossier provides harrowing personal accounts of abuse and mistreatment, including a horrific account of a husband and wife's ordeal at the hands of the Iraqi torturers, the torture of the wife having taken place in front of their children.I think the House would know only too well that the government's primary concern remains disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. As the House knows, we hope that this can be done peacefully. In disarming Saddam Hussein, the international community would vastly improve the security of the region, uphold global non-proliferation norms and deprive Saddam Hussein of one of his main tools of oppression. Let me also make clear that, in drawing attention to this dossier, we are not seeking to foreshadow any particular course of action, and we remain committed to the enforcement of Security Council resolution 1441. The dossier reminds us of the type of regime we are dealing with here. I suggest that all those on this side of the House, who definitely have an interest in the issue of Iraq, and those on the other side who may have an interest as well, take the time to read this report. I will happily make it available to the House at an appropriate time. </DOC>

 - I will make no claims about where the company is being run from without getting advice. I would proffer some suggestions, though, but first I would make the point that those invoices that are being waved around are related to accounts paid three months ago. That, of course, was after she transferred her interest. It is also my understanding that her adult son lives in Woollahra. -  - Yes, that could be the explanation. Nothing unusual about that. - Of course she owns the house. - Oh, he has discovered she owns the house! What an astonishing achievement! What we are witnessing now is an opposition without a shred of evidence. They are too ashamed to move to another subject, so what they are going to do is reheat the same question. We have had three reheats of the one question. We have had the two invoices waved around on three occasions. Of course I will get advice about where the company is being run from. But can I just go back to the fundamental point: where is the evidence of tax avoidance? Where is the evidence that the code was broken? Where is the evidence of wrongdoing that would justify this besmirching of the name of decent Australian citizens? There is none and, until the opposition produce it, they are further reducing their esteem in the eyes of the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and his interest in the economy. I think many Australians are interested in the state of the economy, job prospects, interest rates and all of those other things that affect their lives in very practical ways. The retail trade data today showed that current price turnover actually fell, seasonally adjusted, in October. In original terms retail trade was 6.5 per cent higher in October and over the year, seasonally adjusted, six per cent. So there was quite good growth over the year, but it slowed a bit in the month of October. The turnover for department stores and household goods was up for the month of October, but turnover of recreational goods fell. I do not have an explanation as to why the turnover of recreational goods would fall in the month of October, but it has let the retail trade down for the month. It could well be taken into account in some of these statistical comparisons or in some of the compilations of the figures. I point to the fact that over the course of the year retail trade was six per cent higher in seasonally adjusted terms, so it is still quite strong. Building approval figures were also released today. They showed that the number of building approvals increased by 25.3 per cent in the month of October - 16.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Again, I would not read too much into that monthly figure: it is a very volatile figure. It seems to be a result of lumpy approvals coming through, particularly in medium-density approvals. For example, the number of private medium-density approvals rose by 68.5 per cent in October after falling by 30.3 per cent in September. So you have enormous lumpiness and enormous volatility. The most that you could say about the building approvals is that there does still seem to be some growth, although much more moderate growth, in the housing industry.Also today, the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends was released. Although business confidence remains subdued, the ACCI-Westpac survey noted that capacity utilisation jumped to 10-year highs -  very high in historical terms. It also noted that business investment plans were strong, with plans to invest in plant and equipment being the strongest they have been since 1994. You get a picture of capacity utilisation increasing and business investment looking quite strong. The government expects business investment to pick up from housing, which we expect to moderate. The retail sector appears to be reasonably strong, supported by low interest rates.The great threats to the economy at the moment come from drought and the international economy. We will be getting the national accounts for the quarter tomorrow, which will show what growth was like in the quarter which has just passed. These are difficult times, with the drought and the hardship that is going on, particularly in rural Australia, and with the weakness around the world. But the Australian economy appears, with a diversified growth prospect, to be confronting those challenges as well as any of the developed economies in the world, and we continue to lead the developed economies of the world in terms of growth.</DOC>

 - In case the Leader of the Opposition has missed it, the fact is that Senator Coonan divested herself, in accordance with the ministerial guidelines, of her involvement in Endispute. Don't you know that? She got out of it. She got out of the company in accordance with the rules. My department's advice, which I have read, was:As Endispute was not involved in the area of Senator Coonan's ministerial responsibilities - and in any event her son is not dependent - because she transferred the interest to her non-dependent son - there has been no breach of the Prime Ministerial guidelines.That is what I read out because that is the advice I have. The rule says that they are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if such a private company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty. For example, a minister should question the retention of a directorship in a company in which shareholders extend beyond the minister's own family. Ministers are required to divest themselves or relinquish control of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. What happened here is that, although on one interpretation - and certainly on the interpretation of my department - Endispute was not involved in an area of Senator Coonan's ministerial responsibility, she behaved as if it were and she divested herself of the interest, in accordance with the guidelines. In other words, she was doubly prudent. She had the advice of the department - and people might argue about that. The Leader of the Opposition might argue about that; let him. Let us concede that - not in reality but hypothetically - for the purposes of the argument. The fact is that she did as the guidelines exhorted her to do - that is, she transferred the interest to her non-dependent son. They are the indisputable facts. In those circumstances, stripping aside all the rhetoric, the verbiage and everything, where is the transgression? If we get to the situation in this country where the only people who are going to go into parliament are people who have no assets, it will be a ridiculous state of affairs. This, frankly, is what is involved here.On the information available to me, the minister has done nothing wrong. I think she has been a very competent minister, and judging by the reaction she received in our party room this morning that is the view of the members of the government parties. I find, as I move around the business community, that she is regarded as a very conscientious minister and as a very valuable addition to the front bench. The opposition should pause and understand that what they are trying to do now is generate a case that just will not stand up. If they have some decent evidence, instead of word games, they should present it, and I will have a look at it. But they have not done so thus far, and the case just falls to the ground.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question and her obvious interest in improving the world trading circumstances for our farmers, agricultural exporters and particularly the sugar producers in her electorate of Dawson. It is no secret that Australia takes a very assertive and aggressive stance on agricultural trade policy reform. We take every opportunity to prosecute the case on behalf of Australian agricultural industries and exporters, through the multilateral system - and I understand we still enjoy the support of the Labor Party in that pursuit - where we argue the case that we need to see reform of the levels of subsidies of agriculture that are provided across the world by a number of protectionist countries. We argue that case in the forums of the WTO and in other trade ministerial forums across the world.It is also very important that we engage the support of the developing countries of the world. There are over a billion people living in poverty in countries across the world. Many of those countries are members of the WTO - over 100 developing countries. If they could get better access to the wealthier markets of the world for their agricultural products, we would lift many hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. That argument needs to be taken into those wealthy markets of the world, and we are certainly doing that. We are doing that in a very up-front and aggressive way, through our advocacy of agricultural trade policy reform.Last week in the French newspaper Le Monde there was an article outlining the importance of agricultural trade policy reform, not just for countries like Australia and other members of the Cairns Group but also, more importantly, for the developing countries of the world. We need to get consumers in Europe, the United States and Japan to understand the importance of reforming and removing agricultural subsidies across the world. In the Le Monde article, there was a section that spoke about the distortions in the sugar industry that I know the member for Dawson will be interested in: A recent report by Oxfam, an independent analysis called The Great EU Sugar Scam, has found that the common agriculture policy depresses and destabilises world prices below even the most efficient unsubsidised producers, undercuts developing country exporters in third markets and restricts access to the EU markets by several million tonnes.And yet sugar has continued to escape the reform process of the common agriculture policy in Europe.It is important that we continue to argue the case, as the leader of the Cairns Group and also as the advocate and spokesman for many developing countries, on this particular issue. The reason - it should be pointed out - that we have to continue to argue this case is that, as a result of the Uruguay Round, the levels of support that are provided to agricultural producers in other parts of the world are legal. They were made legal as a result of the negotiations in the Uruguay Round. The Labor Party, in government back then, signed off and legalised those levels of support under the WTO. The Labor Party agreed to the EU supporting agriculture in the EU to the tune of $73 billion. They agreed to a level of support of $31 billion in Japan. They agreed to a level of support of $19 billion in the United States. At the same time, they relegated Australia to only being able to support our agricultural industries to the tune of $300 million. That is the reason we are so aggressive in our stance on reform and, obviously, that is the reason the Labor Party continue to urge the government to focus on the multilateral system - to try to fix up the legacy that they left us from the Uruguay Round of negotiations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I appreciate his concern to ensure that the young people of South Australia are given a fair go. I can inform the House that legislation currently before the South Australian parliament will mean that apprentices and trainees in that state will no longer be able to be employed under federal Australian workplace agreements. Some 1,700 South Australian apprentices and trainees are currently employed under AWAs. One of the reasons why AWAs have proved popular in South Australia is the inflexibility of state awards: 34 of the 67 chief South Australian state awards do not provide for traineeships at all, and some nine of them do not even provide for part-time work. I am very sorry to say to the member for Grey that right now several hundred young South Australians who have commenced working on Australian workplace agreements are in limbo because the South Australian government is refusing to register their training agreements.For the first few months the South Australian government did its best to appear conciliatory, but it seems now that it has embarked upon a simple, ideological crusade. Last week we had the Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education down there, Jane Lomax-Smith, saying, `This government believes in collective agreements not individual agreements.' There they are: the yuppie socialists, the Bollinger Bolsheviks, revealing their true colours. She might as well have come out of the parliament dressed in clogs and cloth cap, waving the red flag and singing the Internationale - that is the kind of time warp she is living in. What this attitude proves is that Chris Schacht was right when he said that the South Australian Labor Party was completely dominated by two union secretaries, despite the Leader of the Opposition's beloved 50-50 rule, which has been operating there for several years. Let me tell the House that the federal government has legal advice that this South Australian act would, if passed, fall foul of section 109 of the Australian Constitution. I urge South Australian members to exercise their independent judgment when considering this matter and not put the jobs and the futures of young South Australians at risk because of Labor's ideological obsession.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Canning for the question. I spent the weekend with the member for Canning in the Peel region, visiting Mandurah, Jarrahdale and Fairbridge. I understand the Prime Minister went to Fairbridge. It is a very important part of Australia's heritage. Regional tourism represents $24 billion a year to regional Australia. It employs 180,000 full-time employees, with a large number of people associated with and reliant on the regional tourism business. In many cases it can hold up towns during tough times.Last week I was in the electorate of the member for Gwydir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I went to Coonabarabran and went down the street to talk to some of the shop owners. The owner of the menswear shop in Coonabarabran said that his sales are about 30 per cent reliant on tourists coming through the town and that, whilst he has been able to survive during these tough times, tourism is an important part of the local business community's sustenance. The newsagent had the same story, as did the Internet cafe. They all said they are very heavily reliant on the number of tourists going through the middle of Coonabarabran.In Broken Hill, in the member for Parkes's electorate, Ron and Richard of Delprat's mine tours said that increasingly they are finding that tourism is holding up the town, even though it is very heavily reliant on agriculture and mining. There is the great example of the Line of Lode, which many ministers have been along over the last few years. The Line of Lode has been a beneficiary of a federation grant from the Commonwealth government, and it is increasingly helping to sustain Broken Hill. So too is the Living Desert, to which we contributed I understand about $1 million. The Living Desert plays a very important part in attracting new tourists to Broken Hill.  What can Australians do this summer to help regional areas that may be affected by the drought? Apart from all the activity that is being undertaken, of course, to help farmers, it is vitally important that Australians continue to take their holidays in regional Australia. Last year 30 per cent of working Australians did not take a holiday. That represents an additional eight per cent to the cost of employment in Australia. A further 20 per cent of Australians did not take their full holidays. It is vitally important, when domestic tourism represents three-quarters of the Australian tourism industry and when 58 cents in every dollar spent on tourism in Australia goes to regional Australia, notwithstanding the drought, that people understand, particularly in the metropolitan areas, that regional Australia is still open to tourism during these summer holidays. People should go out there and spend their money because in many cases those tourism dollars are helping to hold up those towns.</DOC>

 - I am aware of that part of the code. I am also aware, as the Leader of the Opposition should be aware, of the other part of the code that I read out. I again remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when the minister was appointed, she got out of the company. Absent a situation where her husband abandoned the pursuit of his legal career, what more could she be required to do? I know Mr Rogers quite well. I have not personally spoken to him in relation to this matter -  - Yes, and I am not ashamed to know him. He is a very reputable lawyer and he is married to a very reputable lawyer, as well.Government members - Hear, hear! - He enjoys a deserved reputation for considerable competence. I know for a fact, based on what he has said previously to me - not in connection with this issue, and given the sensitivity of being married to a minister in any portfolio - that Andrew is keenly aware of the need to separate his responsibilities from those of his wife. We have had situations in this parliament where a minister of the Crown has been married to a High Court judge, and that has not been the subject of any suggestion of impropriety. - The reality is that, unless you impute dishonourable conduct to two people, the implication in the Leader of the Opposition's question is false. What the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting is that, because Andrew Rogers's company, from which Helen Coonan exited when she became a minister, is involved in a certain form of conduct, automatically there is some appearance of conflict of interest. I reject that, particularly in view of the assurances that I have received from her and, through somebody else, from him -   - that they have taken very great care to keep their respective business and commercial activities separate. As far as the code is concerned, I do not believe on the information available - and it is plain on the information publicly available - that Helen Coonan, the minister, has in any way breached the obligation that the Leader of the Opposition referred to. Quite plainly she got out of the company as soon as she became a minister. Both of them are scrupulous in keeping their professional careers separate, as are many husbands and wives who have independent professional careers - and there are many. I once again make the general observation that I thought we had reached a stage in this country where a man or a woman could have their own career without in some way having attached to them by implication the career of the person to whom they were married. - The whole basis of this grubby little exercise has been guilt by association. They started off on conflict of the code, they have ended up with conflict of the code and they have no evidence. There is no evidence that there has been any breach of that part of the code to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. There is not a skerrick of evidence that there has been any breach of that. There is no evidence that the minister breached the requirement in relation to directorships. She got out immediately. There is no evidence that she was guilty of tax avoidance. There is no evidence that her husband has been guilty of tax avoidance. The truth is that this is a miserable smear campaign which is a last resort for an opposition that has lost relevance in the great policy debates in this country. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question, and I welcome the fact that the New South Wales government has extended this assistance to people in drought affected areas. I think it is a sign of a change by the New South Wales government - and I welcome that - in coming to the help of people in drought affected areas. The government is giving consideration to a number of things relating to issues of drought. When I have something further to say on the subject, I will.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I recognise the interest she shows in this issue. As the House is, I know, only too well aware, UNMOVIC, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, and the International Atomic Energy Agency weapons inspectors began their work on 27 November. They have now visited somewhere in the vicinity of 20 sites in Iraq. Importantly, yesterday, the inspectors went unannounced to the presidential palace at Sejoud in Baghdad. Access was given a few minutes after their arrival and inspectors were unhindered in their work. The visit to the palace was an important message for the inspection teams to send to Iraq - that the inspectors will carry out their mandate of inspections anywhere, at any time and, of course, importantly, on their own terms.We are only in the first week of inspections. It is worth noting what the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, said yesterday - that cooperation seems to be good, but this is not a oneweek wonder. The Iraqis must sustain the cooperation, and there is a long way to go. By their own estimation, inspectors might have to visit something in the vicinity of 700 different sites before their task could be considered to have been completed. We and many others will be watching closely for any signs that Iraq is giving less than the full cooperation demanded of it by the United Nations Security Council.The fact that Iraq continues to fire at American and British aircraft in the no-fly zones is, as President Bush has said, not encouraging. It is also troubling that inspectors have found that missile parts tagged in 1998 by UNSCOM were missing from the site at Waziriya, north of Baghdad. There are also conflicting reports that Iraq attempted a number of times to procure aluminium tubes for use in military programs. Very importantly, I think it should be said that we do welcome advice from Iraq that it will declare what it has in the way of chemical, biological and/or nuclear programs before the 8 December deadline. We believe that the declaration will be made on 7 December. This declaration must be currently accurate, full and complete, according to resolution 1441. UNMOVIC and the IAEA will have to undertake a detailed assessment of the declaration, which could run to 1,000 pages. This will take time. Iraq will need to give a full account of all its civilian and military programs and account for those items left unaccounted for when UNSCOM left at the end of 1998. We will remain in close touch with our allies at this crucial phase of the United Nations mandated process.In the latter part of next week, I will be hosting a visit to Australia by the United States Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage. He will be meeting with the Prime Minister and with the Minister for Defence as well as with me. This will be an opportunity to discuss with him not just broader regional security issues, including the campaign against terrorism, but also the question of Iraq and the requirement that Iraq complies with resolution 1441.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question, and I note his interest in the economic issues that confront Australia at the moment. I inform the House that the September quarter national accounts were released today and they showed that GDP for the quarter grew by 0.9 per cent and by 3.7 per cent through the year. This is very solid growth at a time when Australia is in a very substantial drought. The drought detracted around 0.4 per cent from the GDP growth number, with agricultural production down by about 12 per cent. So, notwithstanding a very severe drought and the effect that that has had on agricultural product, the Australian economy continued to grow in the non-farm area to such an extent that growth was 0.9 per cent in the September quarter and 3.7 per cent through the year, making Australia one of the leading growth economies of the industrialised world. The growth was led by private business investment, which rose by 2.9 per cent in the quarter and 12.2 per cent through the year. We are continuing to get growth in the dwelling sector, which grew by 3.3 per cent, to be 22 per cent higher through the year. The national accounts show strong growth in incomes for employees, which increased by 2.1 per cent in the quarter. As I remarked yesterday, company profits are strong, with a 9.2 per cent growth through the year. However, mixed income - that is, the income of individual self-employed - fell by 1.7 per cent, no doubt reflecting the effects of the drought and farming incomes, which fell for the quarter.The good news on inflation is that the measures of inflation show that it is within the government's target band of two to three per cent, and the household consumption chain price index grew 0.7 per cent in the quarter and 2.8 per cent through the year. Overall, the outlook remains positive for growth, as forecast in the midyear review, of three per cent on year average over 2002-03. This is substantial growth, notwithstanding the great challenges which the Australian economy faces at the moment. Internationally, the economy is weak in Europe and in Japan, and there is a very slow recovery in the United States. In Australia, as I said earlier, the effect of the drought has taken one per cent off our growth forecast for the year and 0.4 per cent off the September quarter.Notwithstanding that, Australia remains one of the growth economies of the developed world. We remain well placed to cope with this international downturn, and I can assure the people of Australia that the government intends to continue strong economic management to keep job opportunities for all of those Australians and their families who rely on a growing economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The government take most seriously the problem of illegal employment, and this question gives me an opportunity to advise the House of the extent to which we have been able to address it in a very positive way. It is important that honourable members are aware that, in Labor's last year in office, fewer than 8,000 people were located living unlawfully in the community. In the last financial year, this number had risen to 17,000 people, double that of Labor's last year in office. In case honourable members opposite are suggesting that there has been an increase in the number of overstayers and people working unlawfully, let me add that the evidence is to the contrary.Australia has a very substantial capacity to identify whether people have travelled in and out of Australia and whether they have returned. Those figures demonstrate that there has been very little change in recent years, and there certainly has not been an increase. The government have also worked extensively with employers, unions and the community to bring into place processes that diminish the ability of unlawful non-citizens to work. To that end, we commissioned the review into illegal workers and we implemented measures to enhance employers' and labour market suppliers' awareness of their obligations under the law. On 1 November, the government introduced increased monitoring of temporary business sponsors in Australia, and 100 per cent of business sponsors are now subject to monitoring activity. This assists the government to check that employers are fulfilling their obligations to employees. In 2001-02, some 2,000 employers were the subject of monitoring and over 1,000 on-site visits occurred.I was asked about other policies, and members opposite suggested that I should be aware of a proposal that they have advanced for a green card. I thought that was a particularly interesting development. I see it as a refinement of what people already have - that is, a passport with a valid visa that records whether or not people have permission to work. So you already have the equivalent of a so-called green card.I have taken the opportunity to read a little more of what the Labor Party have said about this matter. Interestingly, they make the point in their paper that, for a green card system - or a passport and visa with work rights - to do its job of dealing with employment issues, you have to deal with the issue of how you identify other Australians. The very interesting development, which has not been the subject of any reporting or comment but which those opposite might like to look at and consider the implications of -  - If there is an invitation, I would be willing to come. I would be able to inform the debate, and I would do it very conscientiously. I am helping now by ensuring that honourable members opposite know that the implications of their document is that a tax file number will have to become a universal identifier for all Australians. That is the implication in the policy document that has been advanced. The only way in which a green card system could operate would be if you were able to identify others who are entitled to work. The opposition make it very clear that the tax file number would have to become a universal identifier for all Australians. I hope that, in the discussion that takes place, you will consider very fully the implications of what you are advancing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I know he has been a strong supporter of the government's endeavours to stop illegal migrants coming to Australia. I think all members of this House and certainly most people in the Australian community know that over the last year the government's policy in stopping illegal arrivals in Australia has been an outstanding success. One of the components of that success has been the establishment of offshore processing centres in Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. These offshore processing centres have sent a very simple but very strong message to people smugglers, and that is that they will not be able to deliver people to Australia. The fact that the people cannot get to Australia has been absolutely decisive in the government's endeavours to destroy the activities of the people smugglers.This is a country which has in the past been targeted by criminal syndicates. They believed that Australia was a soft touch, and our orderly and generous migration and refugee programs were under attack. There is no question about that, and we had to take quick and decisive action. As I have said, the offshore processing centres have been a central component of that strategy. There is not any doubt that the offshore processing centres, particularly in the case of Nauru, have been mutually beneficial to Australia and our Pacific neighbours. Nauru, in particular, has been going through a very difficult stage financially, and we are working closely with Nauru in order to help it through a difficult period. We have had numerous meetings with President Harris and other members of the Nauru government in order to provide support for them at this time. Significantly, because we have had the processing centre in Nauru, we have been very focused on ensuring adequate services are available to the asylum seekers in the processing centre. That has meant that we have had to assist with the provision of power and water. Most of the fresh water in Nauru comes from a desalination plant. We have done a lot of work to keep power and the desalination plant going in Nauru. Obviously, whilst that is done to the advantage of asylum seekers, of course the people of Nauru have benefited as well.We have had some success not only in the processing of those asylum seekers in Nauru and Manus Island but also, when the processing has been completed, in moving those people on. The numbers in the centres on Manus Island and Nauru continue to decline, with the total population of those centres now at 819, which is down from a peak of 1,515. So the numbers have almost halved from the peak. There have been a total of 195 returns to Afghanistan from both the onshore and offshore processing centres, and more than 350 others have accepted the government's reintegration assistance package and will be returning home in the near future. Importantly, the success of this return arrangement would not have been possible without the cooperation of the government of Afghanistan, and I want to pay tribute to them. They have worked closely with us, and we have appreciated very much their cooperation. That was a point I made to Dr Abdullah Abdullah, the foreign minister of Afghanistan, when he was here a couple of weeks ago. In concluding my answer to the honourable member's question, let me say that we very much appreciate the cooperation of the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea in dealing with this problem of people-smuggling. There has been a regional approach. There has been a contribution made by our Pacific island neighbours. There has of course been a very substantial contribution made by the government of Indonesia - and I talked about that in the House a couple of days ago - and by other governments in the region and even beyond; for example, the governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan and like. I think it is fair to say that Australia has very much driven a broad Asia-Pacific approach to dealing with the problem of people-smuggling. We cannot claim that the problem has gone away forever. The problem always has the potential to re-emerge at any time. We have to be focused, we have to be determined and we have to make it perfectly clear that this country is closed for business for people smugglers. A softening of Australia's approach or the abandonment of the offshore processing centres is of course the kind of putative policy of the Labor Party - although I am not quite sure of its status at this stage. Some announcements have been made before the caucus have considered it, presumably because caucus will not consider it all that favourably. But they will have to now, won't they, because it will become a test of leadership for the Leader of the Opposition. - But I was never as unpopular as you when I was Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - As the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence indicated, she will be seeking some further information on this matter and, when that information is available, if there is anything appropriate to be further advised to the House, she will. The code to which the Leader of the Opposition referred is, I assume, the code that was in force in the 13 years that you were in government. I assume it is the code that applied to ministers - indeed, very senior ministers in that government - in relation to their financial matters. I know the former member for Flinders is remembered hard by the Labor Party, and for good reason: he hit them very hard where it hurt on a large number of matters.Although ruled out of order by you, Mr Speaker, the imputation by the Leader of the Opposition nonetheless stands - an imputation made under parliamentary privilege that in some way the former minister personally gained from the privileged information that comes the way of people who hold office as ministers in any government in this country. There is no evidence of that. My experience in dealing with the former Minister for Defence and member for Flinders is that he was a totally honourable person as a minister. I regard this attempt at the traducing of his reputation as being without any foundation. If the Labor Party has any evidence that Peter Reith has behaved improperly in relation to his consultancies with Tenix -  - then let them lay that information on the table. Let them give that information to me to see if there is any appropriate action required. In the meantime, this attempt to traduce the reputation of the former minister will be as futile as your failed attempt to traduce the reputation of Senator Coonan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The proposal by the opposition to use our embassies and agencies such as the Red Cross to monitor the return of failed asylum seekers, while superficially attractive for the sorts of reasons advanced by members opposite - concerns about people's welfare and circumstances - I suspect has not been the subject of very serious consideration. I would like to help honourable members in at least considering some of the implications of this particular proposal. - At the outset, it is important to recognise that people who are returned from Australia to their countries have been found not to be refugees or to be facing a real chance of persecution: that is on all the evidence, with all the opportunities to test, not only before the department but also through the Refugee Review Tribunal and the judicial review process - all of those matters. Our system is extraordinarily robust and it has significant checks and balances. If people have a real concern, even after going through all of that testing, they have the opportunity to put those matters to me before returning.The important point is whether it is realistic to expect that other countries would be happy to accept open-ended monitoring of their nationals by Australian officials or others. Recently I have noticed people talking about the foreign affairs implications of relationships with other countries. You are asking for Australian officials to routinely monitor the activities of other countries' returned nationals. What would be the implications for the sovereignty of Australia if we accepted other countries monitoring through their missions the activities of their nationals in Australia? That is the question. - This is a proposal to go to other countries and monitor their nationals. I thought it might be instructive for the House to be aware of the implications of that. I table here a list of countries, detailing the citizenship of failed asylum seekers for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02. It shows that there were of the order of 130 different countries to which failed asylum seekers were returned.  - They include France, Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Indonesia, Canada and the Philippines. Let us suppose that these countries would be happy to allow us to come in and monitor their nationals. The next question is how long are you going to monitor them - for the whole of their lives?What does it mean in terms of potential costings with something of the order of 8,000 rejected asylum seekers being found not in need of protection and being returned? I notice in the document I have read that they are saying, in the first instance, that monitoring could be extended to targeted regions. So they are recognising that this is just the beginning. All countries to which rejected asylum seekers were returned would be the subject of monitoring. If you are looking at 8,000 people a year found not to be in need of protection, given the number of countries involved and assuming monthly contact, you would be looking at providing something like $40 million a year. Those figures would expand every year as the number of failed asylum seekers increased. You have written the document. You have left it as open as it is. I encourage you to think about the implications not only in terms of the practicality and the costs but also for Australia's foreign relations. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. I can inform the House that for the workers of Australia, the Howard government has delivered more jobs, higher pay and, just as importantly, fewer strikes. I can inform the House that in August the annual strike rate dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded - just 35 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This is an eightfold decrease on the peak strike rates recorded during the life of the former government. Strikes are down because this government has successfully encouraged a spirit of workplace partnerships. We have encouraged the workers and managers of Australia to make their own decisions at a workplace level rather than accept dictation from ideologically driven outsiders.This government will continue policies designed to give Australian workers higher pay for better work, but I very much fear that this government will continue to be opposed by weak state Labor governments which think that unions are above the law. The new Victorian government hinted this morning that it might drop its industrial manslaughter laws. This is a classic case of standing up to the unions once so you never have to stand up to them ever again. What can you expect from Labor governments which increasingly comprise identikit political careerists? If you look at the new Victorian Labor caucus -  - There are 18 former teachers, 18 former union officials and no fewer than 39 former political staffers. About the only one I could find that had any business experience whatsoever -  - was a former vigneron, but I suppose that is typical of a party comprising chardonnay socialists. No less an authority than Gough Whitlam said the other day that it was unacceptable and counterproductive for unions to be trying to dictate Labor Party policy. I thought at last I had found a new ally, but then I realised that Gough was actually blasting Joe de Bruyn but not other union officials. I do not know which church has canonised St Gough, but it certainly is not Joe's church!</DOC>

 - Now I have forgotten what the centre of the question was. I know: it was about how you-beaut family tax benefit policy. I thank the member for Lilley for reminding me -  - of a policy which has enabled us to deliver something in the order of $2 billion a year of additional family benefits to the families of Australia.Let me take the opportunity again of reinforcing what was said by the Leader of the House in his intervention, and that is that there is not a skerrick of evidence that Senator Coonan has either avoided tax or been late in meeting her tax obligations. There is no evidence of that, and therefore the whole factual basis of the question falls to the ground, because the proposition in the question was that there was a double standard. There is no double standard. Senator Coonan has not, on any of the evidence presented to me, been found wanting in meeting her obligations to the taxation authorities. There is also no evidence that her husband, Mr Andrew Rogers QC, has been negligent in meeting his tax responsibilities. This is nothing other than a rotten smear on a decent minister who is performing extremely well in her portfolio responsibility. I want to make it clear that she retains my 100 per cent support and confidence. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and her ongoing interest in these issues, particularly as chair of the government's policy committee on health and ageing. Over the next 20 years the proportion of the Australian population aged 65 years and over will increase from some 12 per cent, which it is today, to 18 per cent. If one projects out to 2040, we expect that well over a quarter of the Australian population will be aged 65 years and over. So the Commonwealth government recognises not only the importance of meeting the continuing health care needs of an ageing population but also the social and economic impact, particularly in terms of developing, for example, mature age work force strategies.One of the government's major initiatives in addressing the health care needs of an ageing population has been the introduction of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. As with millions of ordinary working families in Australia, older Australians have also recognised the importance of having real choice in health care. This is evidenced by the fact that over one million older Australians - over one million people over the age of 65 years - have private health insurance, which is a resounding endorsement by older Australians of the government's private health insurance policy.This is the rebate that the Labor Party wants to rip away from Australians. Any decline in private health insurance would place unsustainable pressure on the public health system. If you look at the number of admissions to public and private hospitals in the year 2000-01, there was a 0.1 per cent fall in admissions to public hospitals, 5,000 fewer admissions, compared to 12 per cent growth in admissions to private hospitals - some 245,000 additional admissions to private hospitals. Yet the Labor Party is saying that they will rip away the private health insurance rebate. That will place enormous pressure on queues for public hospitals in Australia. The Labor Party's proposal offers no freedom of choice or access for older Australians. They will simply have to join the queue.In terms of an ageing population, the government is also continuing to work on mature age work force strategies. A recent report by Access Economics predicted that the rate of growth in the Australian work force would drop from some 170,000 people per year for this current year to just 125,000 for the entire decade, from 2020 through to 2030 - in other words, from 170,000 this year down to an average of about 12,000 to 13,000 per year from 2020 to 2030. This is why I have appointed the National Advisory Committee on Ageing. They are looking at the issue of mature age employment and the work ability of workers into the future. It is one of the fundamental changes that Australia must face in terms of a need for a workplace revolution. This, along with our commitment to aged care and to the health system in Australia, is an indication of the way in which this government remains committed to the ageing of the Australian population.</DOC>

 - The answer is no, there is no conflict. The sequence of events was that when Senator Coonan became a minister she got out of the company and therefore the question of whether there was a collision of portfolio responsibility and the activities of the company simply did not arise. Let me again, for the benefit of the honourable member for Werriwa, read the relevant section of the code. Against the background of reading the relevant section of that code, let me remind the House that Senator Coonan's portfolio responsibilities include the prudential supervision of insurance. It is in that context that the comments to which you refer were made. The code states: Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies - which is obviously the case here - only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments, and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty (e.g. a minister should question the retention of a directorship in a company in which share holdings extend beyond the minister's own family). Ministers are required to divest themselves, or relinquish control, of all shares and similar interests in any company involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.Even if we accept for the purposes of this answer - which I do not, but I will for the purposes of illustrating my point - that there was a clear covering of the area of portfolio responsibility, the minister plainly complied with the injunction in the guidelines -  - by divesting herself of the interest. This goes to the interjections which have been the subject of questions before. It goes on to say:The transfer of interests to a spouse or dependent family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.She transferred to her adult son, who is not a dependent family member. That is as plain as the proverbial nose on one's face. That is what happened. In those circumstances, even if you accept - which I do not -  - I can only repeat that the interest was transferred to the adult son -  - I do not think the opposition is interested in the answer. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question and take the opportunity to congratulate him on his environmental interest in clean water and ocean sewerage outfalls. Global warming could have very serious consequences for the Australian economy and for Australian sustainability, and the Howard government is working very closely with Australian industry to meet our target for greenhouse gas reductions and more importantly to put in place the long-term framework that will allow Australian industries to invest with certainty in environmentally friendlier technologies.To properly address climate change a global approach is necessary because Australia only makes a very tiny contribution to total global greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, it is very pleasing that Australian industries are already making a significant contribution to the development of technologies that will allow that global approach to be effective. I cite the recent clean coal mission to the United States and Canada which took place under the climate action partnership that I concluded with the United States earlier in the year and which will help to secure Australian participation within the new technologies.The minister for industry and I are currently engaged in an extensive consultative process with Australian industry to ensure that we find the right solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions without threatening Australian competitiveness. I must say it has been very encouraging to observe the changing culture of Australian business towards a recognition of the need for environmental sustainability.This morning I signed an eco-efficiency agreement with the electricity industry through the Electricity Supply Association of Australia. One of the primary targets of that industry and that agreement is greenhouse gas reduction. The industry estimates - and the House may be interested in this - that by the end of the decade on present policies it will produce an annual net saving of 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, the equivalent of moving some four million cars off the road. So the electricity industry, which is a significant producer of greenhouse gas emissions, is already making a significant reduction and is addressing the problem. I congratulate the industry for its foresight and I look forward to working with the Electricity Supply Association, which has now signed the 25th eco-efficiency agreement with the government. Twenty-five major Australian industries are now working with the government to produce environmentally sustainable policies.The government are determined to address these issues while maintaining the competitiveness of Australian industry and retaining jobs and industries in Australia. That is what distinguishes us from the Labor Party, which is prepared in this area to see Australian industries and Australian jobs go offshore because it is prepared to impose legal obligations on those industries which they do not face from competitor countries in the developing world. The government are concerned with Australian jobs and are concerned with Australian growth and intends to meet our obligations and our responsibilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without damaging the competitiveness of this country.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Curtin for her question and her ongoing interest in small business. As the member for Curtin and other members would be aware, for some weeks I have been suggesting to the House that changes to the industrial relations and workplace relations laws in Western Australia will have a bad impact on Western Australia's small businesses. Many members here - the member for Canning, the member for Moore and a range of other members - are familiar with that fact, and we continually advise the parliament that the Western Australian industrial relations laws will have a negative impact on small business.The first test really came back in the recent Yellow Pages business index survey. When I picked up the West Australian newspaper last week to read about the result of the survey, I saw the headline `Small business unhappy'. I thought, `Oh my goodness, crikey, what have we done?' I read the article and it said:More than a third of small business owners in Western Australia say the State Government is working against them. Only 13 per cent of respondents in the Yellow Pages survey this month said the Government - That is the state Labor government - was supportive, 39 per cent said it worked against them and 48 per cent claimed its policies had no impact.That is in stark contrast to the federal government, where the results show that small business support for federal government policies has improved by five per cent. Small businesses are saying that the major reason for the increase in small and medium enterprise support for the federal government is its policies and that it is trying to help small business. That is exactly what we are doing. I thought, `What is the real impact?' because the Labor Party have continually said that their industrial relations reforms would have no impact on small business. I have a copy of the Albany Advertiser, which is from the member for O'Connor's electorate. It says:Industrial relations legislation changes recently introduced by the State Government are affecting some local cafes but leaving others unscathed. Emily's Country Kitchen is closing this month and Cafe Sails only opens during weekdays ... Dylans is preparing to by-pass the changes by using the Federal Australian Workplace Agreements, and Beachside Cafe pre-empted the changes and now predominantly employ staff as contract workers.We have four businesses all prepared to have their names identified in the paper saying that the Western Australian Labor Party's industrial relations laws are costing jobs and costing work. I quote again from the Albany Advertiser:Dylans on the Terrace owner Morris Blake said staff were still on existing workplace agreements but they would be changing to the Federal system which precluded union entry onto the premises. - The member for Curtin, who asked the question, would be aware of Jean-Claude, who operates a small business in Subiaco. He is reported in the West Australian as saying that the new industrial relation laws meant his staff were covered by three awards instead of one. So, when the Labor Party talks about red tape, they should look in the mirror because under Western Australian labour laws now workers in small business are covered by three awards instead of one. The article goes on to say: No amount of juggling the roster could avoid heavy penalty rates for overtime and weekend work. ... Chez Jean-Claude opened in 1997 with a staff of four. Now 42 people work there. ... Customers were told prices would rise 15 per cent ... to compensate for higher wages.Jean-Claude says:The award system does not provide the seven-day businesses with the same flexibility that we had with the workplace agreement, where every employee, customer and employer could -  - This small business, which is now changing its workplace arrangements, has to pay higher wages. This small business in Western Australia says:The award system does not provide the seven-day business with the same flexibility that we have with the workplace agreement, where every employee, customer and employer could profit from the advantage ...He posted that letter in the shop window. I am happy to table copies of those articles. Mr Speaker, if you want to know what the Labor Party does for small business, look no further than Western Australia. Small businesses are closing up. Small businesses are sacking people. Small businesses are not able to operate seven days a week to earn the money that is going to sustain their own families and the families of their employees. The Labor Party is against small business; the coalition is for small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and also for his representation. Whether it is for the ASK Employment and Training Services in Whyalla or getting bricks put down at the Orroroo Area School, here is a man who has built his life beginning as a shearer, a canecutter and, of course, a waterside worker -  - This government's vision of education is based on every Australian, in particular every young person, being able to find and achieve his or her own potential, whatever that is. We recognise that education is about learning how to learn, and that it begins not long after birth and continues right throughout life.  - This government is very committed to young people understanding the importance of remaining at school for as long as they are able and seeing universities as a part of their life horizon, but equally we are determined that every young person will know that they have choices -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just returning to our children's educational and career prospects, they should understand that remaining at school is very important and that universities are an important part of their life horizon. But we are also determined that they will know they have choices - that they can go to TAFE, do an apprenticeship or go into training; and that, for some young people, just getting to school is an enormous achievement and getting from school to the workplace is an even greater one.One of the things that I struggle to understand is the Labor Party's obsession with targets. For example, a target in `noodle nation' or Knowledge Nation was that 90 per cent of our children would complete year 12. In Queensland, 88 per cent are supposed to complete year 12; in Western Australia and Victoria, it is 90 per cent. What does that say to those who think they might be in the other 10 per cent? Are the young people who at the end of year 11 choose to go to be an apprentice in some way of less value than those who go on to university? One of the problems is that, under 13 years of a Labor government, young Australians were told in all kinds of ways that, if they did not go to university, they were not as important as someone else who did. - The Leader of the Opposition laughs with derision and mirth. Just to put a few facts on the table, in one year I have had many questions about universities -  - including concerns for women doing veterinary science or dentistry who might have to delay buying a house because of their HECS debt, but not one question has been considered important enough by the Australian Labor Party to ask of the government about the 362,000 people, mainly young people, who are doing apprenticeships in this country. The member for Brand had to get up and say, `Oh, I wrote you a letter; I asked you a question about training,' and in fact I can tell you, Mr Speaker, there were three others. I do not often agree with Labor Party frontbenchers, but I must say that I did agree with the member for Melbourne when he came into this House on 15 October and said:We have allowed our society to become too focused on academic achievement and too focused on a narrow agenda - which, in some respects, Labor's Knowledge Nation reflected ...When I said in Adelaide last week that I thought we should see that every one of our children was valued as a human being and that young people who go into apprenticeships or get a job are just as important as those who have a university education, the member for Jagajaga went on Radio 5AN and said, `I just think this is so outrageous.' Can you believe that, Mr Speaker? One of the things we must not do is put pressure on young people to be what they are not. As Ken Nicholl of the Building Industry Association group apprenticeship scheme said to Radio 5AN last week:One of the things that we find is that people frown upon taking up apprenticeships, and we think that a change in attitude is necessary for people to see that as a career path people should not feel the pressure to have to go and get a university degree; there are other options out there. The target on this side is that 100 per cent of young Australians will find and achieve their potential, whether in a workshop or a retail store, whether they are kids who come out of the Salvation Army's Youth Oasis program in Sydney who work in a shopfront or people who undertake a university education. If you are interested in your kids getting an apprenticeship, this is the side of politics you support.</DOC>

 - The Age report was drawn to my attention this morning, and I can confirm that the Age report is not correct. Not only is it not correct, not only did it not square with my own memory, but I checked -  -  - I am trying to help you. It is so hard with the Labor Party. You struggle to help them! I said, if you had listened, not only could I not recall having said this - I was about to say something else - but I checked the record. The record confirms that not only was this very constructive and very positive meeting and an opportunity to reinforce something that we think is important and have been successful in achieving - that is, regional cooperation on countering terrorism, and that work is continuing to progress - but also, as I said to the meeting, the Prime Minister was saying to the Australian people that the government would do everything it could to protect them from terrorist attacks. Any Prime Minister, I would have thought, would say that to his or her people, and I made that point as well. I did not say that the Prime Minister is making remarks on the one hand for a domestic audience, hoping that an international audience would not hear them, and that he has a different message for an international audience. I said absolutely nothing of the sort.</DOC>

 - As I know the House will be aware, yesterday there was a large civil disturbance in Dili involving about 600 people. There have been reports of a number of deaths. It was indicated to me this morning in circumstances I will come to in a moment that the number of people whose lives were lost was some three or four. The situation was calmer this morning; nonetheless, it is still very tense. I inform the House that two Australian Federal Police officers sustained minor injuries, one requiring medical treatment, when the UN police compound was stormed. No other Australians were injured. Our embassy advised Australians registered with the embassy to remain indoors. Australians in the affected areas were evacuated, and we are continuing to monitor this situation very closely. The welfare of Australians in Dili is our top priority.I very strongly condemn - as I know all members of the House will condemn - this violence. There is no excuse to resort to this action for any grievance. This morning I telephoned the Prime Minister of East Timor, Mr Alkatiri, to convey the government's sympathy and concern about the loss of life and the damage involved. The Prime Minister's own home was completely destroyed by fire during the demonstration. I said to Mr Alkatiri and his government that, although it was up to him as the leader of a sovereign independent country to resolve the situation, Australia is a close friend to East Timor and is willing to help if that help is required and that help is asked for.I told the Prime Minister of East Timor that we were willing to do what we could to help East Timor to develop the capacity to better handle law and order problems, and we will look at providing additional assistance to help develop the capacity of the East Timorese police and the East Timorese judiciary. It was very plain that the Prime Minister appreciated my call. It was an opportunity for me to remind him that, although East Timor is now an independent country - and it is some three years since the INTERFET intervention following the independence vote that ultimately led to the independence of East Timor - it remains a country for which many millions of Australians have great affection. We are concerned about her future as a nation. It is a small nation, but if well and prudently governed it does have more opportunities, because of its resource endowments, than many other countries of a similar size. We are concerned. We are sorry about the loss of life. We will help if help is sought. The thoughts of the Australian government are very much with the East Timorese government and people at this very difficult time. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is that I have not seen the Age report. The question of what was said by the foreign minister is a matter for the foreign minister. I have every confidence that any account given of a meeting attended by the foreign minister will be a very honest and very professional account of what was said. Although I have not seen the Age report, I have seen a transcript of a press conference addressed by the Leader of the Opposition this morning. It is a very interesting press conference. Amongst other things, he asked me to apologise for what I said. -  - This is a very significant thing, and I want to pursue it a little further. The Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, asked me to apologise for saying that I would do what was necessary - absent another alternative - to defend the interests of this country against a potential terrorist attack. Let me read my answer to the question again for the benefit of the House, for the benefit of the Australian people and for the benefit of anybody who is interested in following what is involved. I had this to say:Oh, yes. I think any Australian Prime Minister would. I mean, it stands to reason that if you believed that somebody was going to launch an attack against your country, either of a conventional kind or a terrorist kind, and you had a capacity to stop it and there was no alternative other than to use that capacity - I repeat `there was no alternative other than to use that capacity' - then of course you would have to use it.Mr Speaker, I ask the Leader of the Opposition: should I really apologise for saying that? Should any Australian Prime Minister apologise for saying that? - I know exactly what I said. I said it deliberately. I said it because it was correct. - With the greatest of charity and respect to the Leader of the Opposition, there is really nothing in those words that requires an apology. - The Leader of the Opposition was calling upon me to apologise for something I had said. What I said was in furtherance of the interests of the people of Australia. I was asserting a position that I believe any Australian would want their Prime Minister to assert, whether he was a Liberal Prime Minister or a Labor Prime Minister. The question of the United Nations has been raised, and I will come to that in a moment. Interestingly, there has been a change in the opposition's reaction on this issue as it has developed. On 20 June I was asked a question about this same issue, and this is what I had to say then:Well the principle that a country which believes it is likely to be attacked is entitled to take pre-emptive action is a self-evidently defensible and valid principle and I don't think you need a government decision to say you agree with that. I mean let me make it very clear if I were presented with evidence that Australia was about to be attacked and I was told by our military people that by launching a pre-emptive hit we could prevent that attack occurring I would authorise that pre-emptive hit and expect the Opposition to support me in the process.That is what I said on 20 June. That did not draw any rebuke from the opposition. Yet, in its breadth and in concept, the principle I then enunciated was no different from the principle that I explained, albeit in even more qualified terms, on the Sunday program in answer to Laurie Oakes's question. Yet, interestingly, no comment was made by the opposition. I did not have the member for Griffith or the Leader of the Opposition coming out and saying, `That's terrible. You have to apologise.' They did not say that I had to apologise for saying that. - Who drives the Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition interjects and refers to other countries. I would have thought our first obligation is the interests of the Australian people. I am not told by others what my foreign policy should be; I am told by the Australian people. What has happened in this particular case is that, when I made my statement on 20 June, there was no response at all from the opposition. Indeed, there was no response from other sources either.On the question of reactions of other countries, I am not going to make any comment on the comments that have been made by other countries. They are entitled to express a view. Through the ambassador, the foreign minister has put, I believe very properly, the basis, the context and the appropriateness of the remarks that I made. Self-evidently, those remarks were not meant in any belligerent sense towards our friends in Asia. That is palpably absurd. We have no belligerent motives, attitudes or predispositions towards our neighbouring countries in the Asia-Pacific region. I was enunciating a perfectly proper and perfectly correct -  - It was a perfectly reasonable statement of a totally defensible principle. I did not make that statement lightly, I did not make it belligerently and I did not make it carelessly; I made it conscious of my responsibilities to the welfare and the interests of the Australian people. In those circumstances, I am staggered that the alternative Prime Minister of this country should ask me to apologise for the statement of a principle designed to protect the security and the interests of the people of this country. I am staggered that the alternative Prime Minister of this country should invite me to do that.As to the question of the United Nations, the existing United Nations charter is the subject of debate and discussion in relation to this issue. There has been no government decision made in either direction. There is properly a debate as to whether the existing self-defence language of the charter continues to be appropriate at a time when aggression is defined by the atrocities of al-Qaeda in Bali, Washington and New York, the Middle East and East Africa, as opposed to when the notion of self-defence had in mind the response of countries such as Poland and others when German tanks rolled across their borders in 1939. Self-evidently, the world has changed and the world has moved on - and that properly provokes a debate. We have not made a decision to argue for a change in the UN charter. The defence minister has not said that; I have not said that. The question of whether at some stage the United Nations charter should be changed is something about which there will be debate, but as to any suggestion that there has been a government decision either way, there is nothing in the language or on the record that suggests that. The kernel of this issue is very simple. I made a totally proper, defensible, correct, deliberate and careful statement directed towards the national interest. I made that statement initially on 20 June. It lay dormant and unrebuked by the opposition. Quite clearly, the opposition did not know what to say at first after I made the comment on Sunday. They waited to get guidance. They finally decided to do something about it. Now, we have this extraordinary assertion by the Leader of the Opposition that I should apologise for saying that I would do what was necessary to defend the people of this country. I find that an extraordinary argument.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. The Prime Minister said a little about this in answer to the question before last. Let me repeat that the Australian government and, I think, all Australians are very disturbed about the violence that took place in Dili yesterday and also the demonstrations that took place the day before. The United Nations has so far confirmed that there was at least one death, although that number may increase. Indeed, my information originally late last night was that two people had been killed, but I now understand that only one death has occurred. Information from our embassy is that Dili has been largely quiet overnight and the situation has remained quiet this morning, although it is tense. The embassy is closely monitoring developments, obviously with the safety of Australians as our top priority.Australian police are part of UNPOL, the United Nations police unit. I believe three Australians were deployed to assist in managing the disturbances yesterday. Under the UNMISET mandate, the United Nations retains responsibility for East Timor's internal and external security. Two Australian police officers received minor injuries from rock throwing. Otherwise, there are no reports of Australians harmed. Yesterday, the embassy advised Australians registered with them to remain indoors. Australians known to be working in the affected areas were evacuated by the embassy staff. A number of Australian civilians gathered at the embassy yesterday and 24 Australians elected to stay at the embassy overnight and were accommodated by the post.Peacekeeping force guards, who were put in place at the embassy some time ago, are remaining at their posts. These guards comprise, in the main, Australian soldiers. Some Australian commercial interests and assets in Dili have been affected and the embassy is staying closely in touch with those who have been affected by the violence. I understand an Australian owned supermarket in Dili, for example, has been burnt down.Australia took part in a major United Nations coordinated needs assessment for the East Timor police service, which took place over the last few weeks. AusAID and the Australian Federal Police will now examine what additional support they might provide to the East Timor police service. Obviously, that is going to be a very important priority as, in the fullness of time and will inevitably happen, the United Nations leaves East Timor.In a democracy like East Timor, all citizens have the right to express themselves freely - of course they do - but with that right comes the responsibility to act peacefully and within the limits of the law. As the Prime Minister has made perfectly clear, Australia will continue to stand by East Timor as it works its way through the difficulties of the last two days and to meet its broader security challenges. We continue to contribute some 25 per cent of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force looking after East Timor's external security and we have a strong presence in the United Nations police presence. </DOC>

 - I am aware of those remarks made by the person from the Philippines. I am also aware of some other remarks. Also, as a consequence of other events only a few weeks ago, I am conscious of the reaction in Indonesia for example to the ASIO raids. There were expressions of concern about the cooperation between the Australian police and the Indonesian police in the Bali investigation. There were suggestions then being made that that cooperation would be put at risk because of the raids. That did not materialise. I do not think there is any doubt at all that the close security cooperation between Australia and other countries in the region will continue because the basis of that cooperation is a well-grounded mutual interest in working together to fight terrorism. We have an interest in cooperating with them and they have an interest in cooperating with us.The Leader of the Opposition says, `What have you done?' I have done two things. Firstly, I have stated in a completely non-belligerent fashion a completely unexceptionable principle - and a principle that I would have thought enjoyed bipartisan support. Indeed, I held that view until this morning, when I heard this quite remarkable statement. Can I just gently remind the opposition leader again. He was asked on 2 December, three days ago -  - I listened to the Leader of the Opposition. This is an important issue. - I listened to him and I am treating his question courteously. - As I was saying, he was asked on 2 December -  - He was asked the following question:Getting back to the threat of a terrorist attack, though, if you became aware of that and it were imminent, you may not have time for talking. Would you support a pre-emptive strike in that case?Answer from the Leader of the Opposition:That is a different proposition. - Oh, it is? He then went on to say:Under the UN charter, there is already the capacity for member nations, in self-defence, and where they can identify clear and present danger, to take appropriate action.If the Leader of the Opposition was saying on 2 December -  - What the Leader of the Opposition said, in effect, in that answer was that it was perfectly legitimate for the leader of a country to enunciate the principle that I had enunciated. Now he is asking me to apologise for saying something that he, in substance, agreed with only three days ago. The measure of his confusion on this is quite extraordinary. The Leader of the Opposition has talked about correcting the record - he said that in his question. If he is talking about the statement I made on the Laurie Oakes program, there is no correction needed, because what I said on the Laurie Oakes program, I meant. What I said on the Laurie Oakes program was right. What I said on the Laurie Oakes program, the Leader of the Opposition, in substance, agreed with three days ago. What I said on the Laurie Oakes program was not directed to our friends. I have made it very plain by public statements that no belligerence was intended.To start with, when I said it on 20 June, you did not hear a peep out of the opposition. You heard nothing from 20 June because they had not seen any headlines, so they decided it wasn't a goer. This is a great way to construct an alternative foreign policy for the people of Australia! I repeated, in substance, what I had said on 20 June on the Laurie Oakes program - deliberately; nothing needed to be corrected. It was a perfectly proper statement of principle by a serving Prime Minister of this country. They then decide to give it one question in the parliament, I think on Monday, and then they run away from it for the next two question times. Now they decide this morning that they are going to call on me to apologise for something they ignored on 20 June; were uncertain about how to respond to last Sunday; and initially, in substance, through the Leader of the Opposition, agreed with. And now they are turning around and saying that I should apologise for it. As I have indicated before: what I said on the Laurie Oakes program, I meant. I meant it because I think it is wholly unexceptionable, wholly proper and wholly to be expected that a serving Prime Minister of this country would be willing to behave in the manner I outlined, subject to the qualifications I then enunciated. I said here on Monday and repeat it today: if I were not willing to behave in accordance with that principle, I would be failing the most basic test of the great office I now hold.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for that question. I know his very well-founded and longstanding interest in matters relating to the research future of Australia. I am delighted to inform the House that, following extensive consultations, the government has selected and announced four national research priorities to focus our investment on research in key areas that can deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits to this country.This is the first time that the Commonwealth has set national research priorities. I want to express my thanks to the Minister for Education, Science and Training; the Minister for Science; the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham; Dr Jim Peacock; and many others who advised the government in relation to the selection of these four priority areas. The four priority areas are: firstly, an environmentally sustainable Australia; secondly, the promotion and maintenance of good health; thirdly, frontier technologies for building and transforming Australian industry; and, finally and very importantly, safeguarding Australia.The impetus for establishing these research priorities came out of the Backing Australia's Ability program that I announced at the beginning of last year - a clear, sharp edged, forward looking, practical program to build and expand the research and scientific base of Australia. It is a program that has already resulted in many of the best and the brightest returning to Australia to carry on their research careers because this increasingly is seen as a country for the best and the brightest, whether you were born in Australia or you wish to come to this country.As a first step towards implementation, all Commonwealth research and research funding bodies will be asked to submit plans to the government by May 2003 outlining how they propose to support the four priorities. The government has also announced a major exercise to take stock of the state of Australian science by mapping science and innovation activities across the private and the public sectors. I have written today to state and territory premiers and chief ministers outlining the four priority areas and seeking their support for this very important national initiative.Because today has been the occasion for a meeting of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, I take the opportunity of recording my gratitude to this body - which I have the privilege of chairing - for the advice and counsel it has given to the government in so many important research, scientific and education areas. We were reminded at that meeting of the Prime Minister's science council this morning that the original inspiration for the establishment of the national CrimTrac database - which proved to be so crucial in supplying the DNA methodology, if I can put it that way, for the identification of the victims of the Bali atrocity - came out of a recommendation of the science and engineering council back in 1999.It is a classic area of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states where we have a common database. We do not have a rail gauge problem in relation to the database that exists there. Just as we have to sweep away those differences in other areas, we were able to do it here. We were reminded by one of the task groups today that reported on some of the scientific aspects of the fight against terrorism of how tremendously important having a national database was. That council has been invaluable and I know that my ministerial colleagues and I draw great benefit from it. It brings together the cream of the scientific community in Australia and it is another example of the willingness of this government to see science as being not only important but crucial to the future of this country. I have said it before and I will repeat it here today: I want to arrive at a situation in this country where the achievements of our men and women of science are as lauded, revered, respected and talked about as the achievements of our magnificent sports men and women.</DOC>

I did not assert, as the member for Griffith so trickily suggests, that we were -  -  - I never used the words he attributed to me; I did not. This is what I said:... I think any Australian Prime Minister would. I mean, it stands to reason that if you believed that somebody was going to launch an attack against your country, either of a conventional kind or of a terrorist kind, and you had a capacity to stop it and there was no alternative - I repeat `no alternative' - other than to use that capacity, then of course you would have to use it.They were the words I used. I stand by those words. I said them deliberately. I do not withdraw them, I do not resile from them. I do not apologise for them. The member for Griffith is clutching around for a question because his leader has made such a hash of this issue by calling on me to apologise for something he actually agrees with. That is the tangle into which the Leader of the Opposition has got himself. In those circumstances -  - The member for Griffith asked me about other countries. I say - through you, of course, Mr Speaker - to the member for Griffith that I am elected to speak for Australia. Other people are elected to speak for their countries, and I will leave it to them to speak for those countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question and for her interest in the baby bonus, which is one of the policies the government took to the last election and which we introduced in March of this year. The idea was that women who had to go out of the work force to have a child be given the benefits of income tax averaging. While you are in the work force you pay a high rate of tax, but when you go out of the work force and have no income you lose the benefit of the tax-free threshold. If you are given the right to average income, you can bring down your overall tax liability. Farmers have the right to average income, artists have the right to average income - why should women who are having babies not also have that right? In addition to that, for those who were not in the work force before they had their child, there was a minimum payment of $500. The payments became available on tax returns from 1 July 2002, and I can inform the House that since that time a total of 118,000 Australians have received a baby bonus payment. That is $38 million worth of assistance to Australia's families. If you have not been out of the work force for a full year, you pro rate. In the first year there was an average payment of $340, allowing for pro rating. The vast majority of those payments went to people with taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. So it was real help for families at the time women were leaving the work force to have their first baby and it helped them over some of those costs. What else can you do to help families? The government increased family tax benefits as part of its new tax system with $2 billion a year back in July 2000. - The government also introduced the first home owners scheme - a grant of $7,000 or $14,000 for a new home during the period it operated. What else can you do to help families in Australia today? Low interest rates help families. Imagine the terrible turmoil and difficulty families would be having if home mortgage interest rates were at 17 per cent in Australia. Imagine the difficulty of that. Being able to take advantage of low interest rates is of great benefit to families. So who stands against the baby bonus? Who stands against $38 million to young families? The Australian Labor Party does. - The Australian Labor Party stands against the baby bonus and against helping first-time mothers. The Australian Labor Party has indicated that the baby bonus would be at risk under a Labor government, which would take benefits away from families. Imagine where families would be under a Labor government. Not only the baby bonus but also private health insurance is at risk under Labor. They want to take away up to $1,200 a year for the private health insurance rebate. Why would Labor want to take these benefits away from families? They do not understand the help families need and they never understood low interest rates.

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. I appreciate that this is an important topic and that he has an understandable interest in it, so let me give him a little bit of background. In February 2000, the Employment Advocate commenced a prosecution, as I understand it, against a union, a union organiser and a company because of what it regarded as breaches of the freedom of association principles of the act. In November 2000, as I understand it, that action was dismissed by the Federal Court. Shortly thereafter, the union in question proceeded against the Employment Advocate and the witnesses used by the Employment Advocate for costs. In December 2000, the then minister for workplace relations provided an indemnity to the witnesses in question on the not unreasonable grounds that people who give testimony on behalf of the Commonwealth should be supported. I also point out by way of background that the Employment Advocate has brought some 19 prosecutions of this type and this is the only one that has not succeeded. I have carefully considered the issues which have been raised by the member for Barton and I am quite confident that both the Office of the Employment Advocate and the former minister have acted with perfect propriety in this matter. </DOC>

 - I take the opportunity of thanking the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question because it enables me to bring to the House's attention the advances the government has been able to make in producing an immigration program that produces very substantial benefits for Australia. The program now has enormous credibility and relevance to the community at large. We have reshaped the legacy that we were left with - a skilled program of a mere 29 per cent - when we came into office. The program today has a skilled component of the order of 58 cent. That is a very significant shift which has produced substantial benefits in economic terms and which gives the program credibility when arguing before the broad Australian community for support for migration as a national interest program. Access Economics have recognised that our current program brings fiscal benefit - said to be of the order of $4.3 billion, over the forward estimates of the Commonwealth budget. Over a 10-year period it is of the order of $32.7 billion - if this year's program and its composition are maintained. Skilled migrants provide most of that benefit. The rebalancing of the program that we have been able to achieve has meant that we have been able to maintain the commitment to family and humanitarian programs - programs which do impact quite negatively on the budget. I table for the benefit of members a chart which simply demonstrates - this is the median point - that $49.8 million per thousand migrants comes from the business migration program and $37.7 million per thousand skilled and independent migrants is credited to the budget. The humanitarian program - and one understands the reason for these costs - is a cost of $28.2 million to the budget. This is a table that will be very useful to people who want to be able to explain how a balanced, structured immigration program that is highly skilled brings demonstrable benefits for the Australian community.I have been asked whether there are any alternative programs. I have looked closely to find alternative programs. I have not seen full reporting of a lot of the detail, and it might help if people were to focus on some of that detail. When I turn to an alternative program advanced by the Labor Party, I find that on page 34 it says:There has been a change in the humanitarian program under this government and the proportion of places has fallen.It has fallen because the number of places has risen, but the humanitarian program has remained constant. It is pointed out that it has fallen from 18 per cent to just 10 per cent. It then goes on to say:We will address that within the current immigration intake numbers.So the Labor Party are saying they have in mind increasing the humanitarian program by as many as 9,000 places. You cannot go out and argue that you want the figure to go from 10 per cent to 18 per cent unless by implication you are saying that you expect a major increase - and the increase is 9,000 places. They remain silent on where they will achieve that change, but I am sure they would not be achieving that change by denying an Australian spouse an entitlement to be reunited with their partner. I am sure they would not be doing that. The shadow minister nods, so I take that as agreement. So she is saying, `We will increase the humanitarian program at the expense of the skilled program' - it is perfectly obvious. What does that mean? You have to ask yourself whether this was a policy for the moment or a policy for the next election. If it is a policy for the next election, then the Labor Party's fiscal credentials need to be closely examined. If this is a policy for the next election and the Labor Party is going to shift 9,000 places from skilled migration into the humanitarian program, what it is talking about - on the preliminary advice available to me - is a net loss to the budget over the forward estimates of $1.2 billion. If you look at the forward estimates, the cumulative effect of that is $28.5 billion over 20 years. I have not started costing this policy yet, but the preliminary estimate for just the first significant change advanced by the Labor Party attaches that sort of cost. I am sorry I was not invited to that meeting today. I might have been able to save the Labor Party from the embarrassment of having presented proposals that would have such a disastrous fiscal impact. </DOC>

 - Again I thank the member for Barton for his question, although I would take issue with the facts that he claims in his question. My understanding of the two gentlemen in question is that one was an employer and the other was an employee, and that is why there was some payment from one to the other. But let me make a few general points. First, law enforcement agencies need to use witnesses. Second, sometimes those witnesses turn out to be less reliable than we might hope. Third, in the case of the Employment Advocate, one failed prosecution out of 19 is not a bad record. Fourth, I have complete confidence in the actions of the Employment Advocate. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. He is an excellent and hardworking member and represents his constituents well. Australia makes no apology for the tough approach it takes to stopping criminals who run people-smuggling syndicates and who target Australia. It is important to our whole-of-government approach to this issue that we make sure we send a simple message to the people smugglers that they cannot make money by landing people in Australia. A very important component of that has been the establishment of offshore processing centres in Nauru and Manus Island, which is part of Papua New Guinea. We are very appreciative of those two governments for the cooperation they have shown in making this policy of supporting offshore processing centres workable.  There is no doubt that amongst the measures which have successfully stymied the people smugglers has been the existence of the offshore processing centres. This has now become a major issue of difference between the government and the federal opposition; there is no question about that. The Labor Party wants to close offshore processing centres. It wants to send out a very simple message to people smugglers. The message from the Labor Party to the people-smugglers is that you can get to Australia, you can land people in Australia. The message that this government send to people smugglers is that we will send those people to offshore processing centres. That is a very different message from the Labor Party's message that the door is open to the people smugglers, that they can resume their trade of getting people landed here in Australia. The honourable member asked a broad ranging question. Another critical aspect of the government's policy is, as I have said on many occasions in this House, strengthening regional cooperation. We are doing that not just in the ways I described yesterday to the House, but also by providing technical capacity in source, transit and destination countries so that they have a better capacity to deal with this problem. For example, Australia is working with China to draft model legislation which will provide assistance for countries seeking to develop legislation criminalising people-smuggling under their domestic laws. We are providing $1 million in aid funding for the Jangalak reception facility in Kabul, Afghanistan, to house up to 600 recent returnees. The facility will provide vocational and technical training to help the returnees in their reintegration into Afghan society. We are providing border control training programs for 18 Pacific Island countries to improve their capacity to detect and deter people smugglers and traffickers.Over the past year, Australian officials have carried out similar training for 763 officers of the Royal Thai Police. We are supporting a $4.7 million project designed to establish cross-border arrangements for return and reintegration of victims of people-trafficking in Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Thailand. It is by virtue of our cooperative approach in the region, including through our varied and substantial technical assistance programs, that we are making such an extremely effective contribution to stopping the problem of people-smuggling.The government recognise that to beat criminal people-smuggling syndicates we need to build regional cooperation. But we cannot put all of the responsibility for this problem onto the shoulders of our neighbours. We have to be prepared to take measures ourselves; not just ask our neighbours to do it for us. This government have been able to achieve both of those things with substantial success.</DOC>

A general policy in relation to indemnities to witnesses is applied across government and is applied in different circumstances in different cases. -  - The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has already explained that witnesses do not necessarily live up to their proof.

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. He has a particular interest as the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The Howard government has consistently committed itself to doing everything it can to protect Australians from the scourge of terrorist acts. As part of that commitment, we have developed legislation to enhance the ability of ASIO to gather intelligence and to assist it to deter and prevent terrorist acts. The so-called ASIO bill is a vital part of the government's counter-terrorism legislative package. It is not designed for law enforcement purposes. New terrorist offences were created in counter-terrorism legislation passed earlier in the year. Our key aim in relation to the ASIO bill is to find out as much as we can about potential terrorist attacks so that we can stop them before people are harmed. The government's bill will strengthen our ability to do just that. The members opposite have made a lot of noise seeking to downplay the extent of the considerable safeguards that are contained in the bill. They know, in fact, that there already is an extensive regime of safeguards to protect the individual liberties of those subject to the proposed warrants. Yet they continue to pursue amendments in the Senate that are either unworkable or undermine the effectiveness of the bill. What I find very curious, given the noise over the ASIO bill, is the distinct lack of noise from members opposite about the proposals put up by their New South Wales counterparts and, I am advised, passed by the New South Wales parliament last night. The Labor Party has for some time been a policy-free zone such that the public does not know what it stands for, but this fundamental inconsistency between New South Wales Labor and federal Labor really takes the cake. The Carr government has given the New South Wales Police the power to strip search children between the age of 10 and 18 without a warrant, where there is a threat of a terrorist act. The New South Wales Police will also be able to search persons' premises and vehicles without a warrant. I repeat: no warrant and, in this case, no judicial oversight, just the authorisation by the police minister.Given the attitude the Labor Party has had to the ASIO bill, we could have expected a bit of noise from members opposite but what we have is not one single solitary peep - nothing from the member for Banks, nothing from Senator Faulkner. In contrast, the opposition continue to delay the ASIO bill in the Senate, preventing ASIO from having important powers to protect the public. Under the government's bill ASIO must, through the director-general, seek the consent of the Attorney-General and seek the authority of a judicial officer before obtaining a warrant to detain and interrogate anybody. Both the Attorney-General and the judge or magistrate must be convinced of the need for the warrant and the information sought that cannot be found by any other means. Detention is subject to strict procedural requirements and safeguards and must be conducted before a prescribed authority. It is an offence punishable by imprisonment to contravene the safeguards. A detainee has a right to seek a remedy in relation to the warrant or treatment under it. ASIO must report to the Attorney-General on the outcome of the warrant and publish statistics on it in the annual report. The parliamentary joint committee chaired by the member for Fadden will review the operation of the laws after one year and report to the parliament. Let us make it perfectly clear: the New South Wales legislation contains absolutely none of those safeguards. The police minister gives permission for searches, break-ins, strip searches. The judiciary is never involved - not to authorise the conduct, nor to adjudicate the validity of the actions or decisions of the police minister in any way or at any time. There will be no public information on the use of the powers and no parliamentary review or inquiry before or after the bill passes. The Australian community can readily recognise the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue. We have a strong bill; we have appropriate safeguards in it. We are seeking to protect the community. The Labor Party should get behind the government and help us protect the community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for giving me an opportunity of saying something about the COAG meeting. I always look forward to COAG meetings. They are an innocent part of the political calendar. What the member for Wills mentioned is but one of three options in relation to that issue. He also touches upon the general area of water policy. It is a very important issue and it requires the cooperation of the states and the Commonwealth. It is appropriate on the day that the Senate has, I understand, passed the stem cell legislation - the subject of a free vote which flowed out of an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states at an earlier COAG meeting - that I emphasise the importance of reaching agreement.We have put it to the states that, in order to make progress, we need to have a fully recognised and enforceable water right or water title across the Commonwealth. This is very much a rail gauge issue. We cannot solve the water problem unless we have a water right regime where the title to water in Victoria is enforceable and recognisable in Queensland and Western Australia. Only if you get that can you establish a market and only if you have a market do you have any hope of introducing some of the disciplines that are needed in order to introduce a degree of constraint and rationality in the whole issue. We take the view that if somebody has their water right diminished or taken away they should be compensated. It is very important that that principle be enshrined in any understanding between the Commonwealth and the states and we will be arguing very strongly for that.We have some proposals to put in relation to the use of the competition payments. Competition payments were established by the Keating government. One of the reasons why competition payments were established was that at the time we did not have a growth tax for the states, and we have now fixed that. It is legitimate in our view that, increasingly in future years, the competition payments be applied towards the payment of compensation to people who have their water rights taken away or diminished. That is an issue that I will be putting to the states in my calm and careful way, as I do with these matters. I am sure the states will respond in their traditionally courteous and calm fashion. In relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, it is a huge part of the issue and I am sure it will be very much in our minds. I am very grateful for the constructive approach taken by the member for Wills in raising this matter on the eve of the COAG meeting. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. Our ambitious and aggressive trade policy is generating jobs and is generating them right across the economy. We are pursuing the multilateral and the bilateral opportunities that Australians expect us to whilst working within the guidelines of the WTO, as I mentioned earlier in the week, and playing a leading role in WTO negotiations. At the same time, we are also embarking upon many bilateral negotiations. Most recently we concluded the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the first free trade agreement that we have concluded in 20 years since we negotiated the CER with New Zealand.Out of that agreement flowed a number of benefits to different parts of the economy. Obviously there will be benefits from the elimination of tariffs between the two countries, and we have also achieved an agreement to double the number of law schools whose graduates can now practise law in Singapore. Interestingly, Singaporean government scholarships can now be used in Australian universities - like the Charles Sturt University in the member's electorate of Riverina. We have negotiated significant removal of residency requirements for Australian professionals such as architects, engineers, accountants and auditors. We have improved the access to Australian law firms to the point where we have better access than our competitors in that market. We have also removed a lot of the restrictions on wholesale banking licences in that market. It goes to show that by negotiating bilaterally you can achieve these things. The member asked about alternative policies. I am not sure about policies; we have seen some odd statements by members opposite.  - One million jobs have been created since 1996; 20 per cent of this economy is generated by exports, so one in five jobs across the Australian economy come out of exports. The member for Port Adelaide would realise that, coming from South Australia. The opposition spokesman on trade matters said recently:As Labor's Shadow Trade Minister I despair at the damage the Government is doing to the cause of trade liberalisation through ... pursuit of discriminatory bilateral trade deals.Does that mean that the Labor Party despairs that we have now got increased access for law firms into the Singaporean market? Does the Labor Party despair that we are removing tariff barriers to get access into that market? Does the Labor Party despair that Singaporean scholarships can now be used in Australian institutions? Does the Labor Party despair that we have removed the restrictions on wholesale banking licences so Australian financial institutions can compete in that marketplace? It really is a worry where the Labor Party is coming from on this, but I can tell you that our government is going to continue to pursue the policy both bilaterally and multilaterally.Only yesterday, because of our bilateral engagement with Mexico - where we saw the tariffs removed from coal imports into that country - we saw a contract allocated to a company from the Hunter Valley, and the members from the Hunter Valley would recognise the benefits that will accrue: a $US70 million contract because we have been pursuing bilateral opportunities for Australian exporters.   - Our trade agenda is in Australia's best interests.  - I warn the member for Rankin! - Australia's trade agenda is in the national interest, and we will continue to pursue it in the national interest. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. He is a big man with a big electorate and a very big heart. We saw that last week. He is looking after not only work and family but little lambs as well. -  - There is too much interjection. I would like to follow up on the question asked by the member for Parkes, and that is the coalition's response to balancing work and family. There is no doubt that under a coalition government, as the Treasurer articulated earlier, there are a number of positive benefits, particularly for families. First of all, low inflation and low interest rates have been very beneficial in helping Australian families, as have a fairer taxation system, family tax benefits and child-care benefits. There is no doubt that child-care benefits have been a tremendous success story for the coalition. A report last week by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare said:Increasing participation of mothers in the work force was one of the main reasons for the growth and demand for child care in Australia, and the Commonwealth has responded to this growth in demand.The coalition certainly have responded to this growth in demand. We have spent 70 per cent more in the last six years than Labor did in their last six years of government. We made child care even more affordable with the introduction of the child-care benefit, which came into place in 2000. We are spending $8 billion over the next four years - $1.6 billion this year. Going through the arithmetic, back in the dying days of the Keating administration there were 310,000 child-care places funded; today there are over 500,000 places funded. That is a 61 per cent increase or, to put it another way, more than 720,000 children are now in some form of Commonwealth funded child care. The member for Parkes did ask about families living in rural and regional areas. There is no doubt they are under enormous strain at the moment, particularly those in drought affected areas. Where we have been able to help over the last few years, and where we are continuing to help, is through the disadvantaged area subsidy. This now goes to over 650 child-care centres across Australia, where we provide a part subsidy to help those centres which otherwise may be unviable. Likewise, we have spent over $5.5 million in private provider incentives, again encouraging - I notice the member for Dickson nodding - other very good private child-care providers. We are helping these centres provide long day care where it may not be viable without the private provider incentive. I notice that, in the electorate of Wide Bay, there is a 44-place centre in Gayndah. In the electorate of Barker, in Keith, there is a 40-place centre and even in the town of Ballan -  - in Ballarat, there is a 30-place centre, again specifically because of this private provider incentive. I would like to pay tribute - I think all members of the House should pay tribute - to the outback mobile resource unit. They do a fantastic job. Recently, I announced an increase in funding to a number of those services, having visited a number of child-care services in Cobar, Narromine and Dubbo in the member's electorate of Parkes. Certainly the outback mobile resource units are doing a terrific job under very difficult conditions at the moment.For many families in rural and remote communities, the only access they have to child care outside their immediate families is often through these mobile units which go to out-stations, providing play care or at least some kind of child-care program which otherwise they would not provide. Whilst, as a parliament, we might not be able to solve the drought and commodity prices, certainly what we can do through outback services is ensure that child care remains available, particularly to those going through the drought. I commend the coalition on its effort in making child care flexible and affordable for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Australia is not dithering in the area of aviation safety. Indeed, the ANAO has been reviewing aviation safety arrangements and coordination between agencies and what have you, and in due course will be reporting on that. It is my clear understanding - without in any way pre-empting its report - that the ANAO believes that Australia's aviation sector, and the transport department in particular, responded very quickly and very comprehensively under the prevailing circumstances after 11 September 2001. Right around the world many of those reasonable rules which have been taken in relation to aviation security were thrown overboard. One of the most central thoughts and guiding principles was that people who were going to do something nasty with an aeroplane would not be intent upon killing themselves; they would not put things in the hold. That has been the subject of review. Based on security assessments -  -  - Mr Speaker, it would appear that not many in the Leader of the Opposition's camp are interested in the answer to the question that he raises, even when it goes to national security.  -  - I make the point -  - It is an important question and it deserves an answer. It is only reasonable that people might like to hear the answer. In broad terms, we have been checking on the basis of risk assessments what goes into the hold of many aircraft since 11 September and we have been actively engaged in developing a much further reaching program for implementation in this country, which is, if I can put it this way, almost completely -  - Almost concluded by cabinet now are arrangements which we will be putting to the industry very shortly. They will see, as the Prime Minister has foreshadowed, very significant further security arrangements being put in place. I do not intend spelling those out chapter and verse, for obvious reasons. I simply make the point that a very great deal has been done. We respond not on the basis of cost but on the basis of risk assessments. We are absolutely at the cutting edge of what is being done in terms of aviation security internationally. I suggest that for the alternative government in this country to be talking about dithering is not only wrong; it is hardly an appropriate signal to be sending.  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson, who, along with many members from both the Liberal and National parties, has been making very vigorous representations to the government in relation to the impact of the drought on so many parts of Australia. I think all Australians are aware that this drought is particularly widespread, that its serious to severe rainfall deficiency now covers about 70 per cent of Australia and that some areas are experiencing their worst rainfall in recorded history, or facing their third successive year of drought.As a result of that and of representations made to me by farming organisations and also the representations made to the government by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the government has decided on a number of additional measures totalling some $368 million over three years. When that is added to the estimated $360 million potentially committed to underwriting the cost of exceptional circumstances arrangements and the $460 million which is the impact of the revenue forgone in relation to the farm management deposits, we see an amount already committed by this government - on conservative estimates - of close to $1.2 billion in order to respond to what in many parts of Australia is arguably the worst drought that this country has had for the last 100 years.The additional measures that have been announced today include the introduction of six months income support for all eligible farmers anywhere in Australia in the areas suffering a one in 20 rainfall deficiency over the period March 2002 to November 2002. As more than 80 per cent of farmers in New South Wales - the state worst affected - are in areas that meet this criterion, we have decided that eligible farmers in the whole state of New South Wales will be entitled to immediate interim income support. And so as to guarantee equality of treatment to different parts of Australia, I also inform the House that, should the proportion of farmers affected in other states reach the level of 80 per cent, eligible farmers across the whole state will have access to similar income support.The effect of this decision will be to dramatically simplify the processes between the states and the Commonwealth regarding the treatment of interim assistance and the declaration of exceptional circumstances. It means that, if you are in an area where the rainfall falls within the criterion of one in 20 years over that nine-month period, you will have immediate access to the interim income support for a period of six months. Applications for exceptional circumstances will continue to be made in accordance with existing procedures. The question of whether the business support available under exceptional circumstances will become available will be determined according to the treatment of those applications.In addition, there will be introduced an interest rate subsidy on new and additional commercial loans up to $100,000 for stock support and drought recovery for eligible farmers in the areas receiving drought interim or exceptional circumstances income assistance. An interest rate subsidy on existing or new commercial loans of up to $100,000 will also be made available to small business in areas that are declared to be entitled to exceptional circumstances. Those subsidies will be subject, not surprisingly, to eligibility criteria that demonstrate that the business has been severely undermined by the drought. That decision has been taken in recognition of the fact that, when an area is affected by the drought, it is not only the farmers but also the small businesses in the area with which the farmers do trade and business that are severely affected by the drought. We have also decided to establish Drought Force, which is a Work for the Dole type program in drought affected areas, to develop and carry out activities that have a skill retention and drought mitigation aspect. The measures announced today follow, as I said at the beginning of this answer, a number of other decisions that have been taken by the government. This drought is devastating in its breadth, its impact, its length and the social and economic consequences that it is having. When you examine the measures that I have announced today and you add them to the measures that we have already introduced, they demonstrate a sustained determination by this government to respond in an appropriate, in a generous, in a timely and in a comprehensive fashion to this very severe drought.</DOC>

 - I will be very shortly making a major announcement on security arrangements after extensive consultations right across the industry. In response at all times to security risk assessments, we have been able to move in a way to secure the safety of the travelling public. I would make the general point, as I made a moment ago, that we are very much at the forefront, internationally, of ensuring that the travelling public - and those who travel via air, in particular - have their safety securitised. But again, I would emphasise that we have been working on a very detailed response -  - As soon as I have been in a position to advise the industry of exactly how all these matters will be handled - that will be a matter of days, not weeks - all will be revealed, including in relation to the airport that you raise.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his very real interest in it. The Prime Minister and I recently visited Cobar, where we spent quite a bit of time talking to people in that community who are not farmers but are feeling the effects of the extraordinary downturn in their local regional economy. We are seeking to help keep farmers' liquidity up in this crisis because that is obviously a foundation stone for regional economies like Cobar and many others across New South Wales, and indeed Australia. Farm spending is the lifeblood of many small towns, and businesses in those towns depend on the rural industries to provide a basis for their economy and for the people who they employ. Today's announcement of drought type loans for small businesses in drought hit country towns is an important extension of our drought response. It will help keep those businesses viable, help them keep their skilled tradesmen and help ensure that, when the tractors start up again, the services are there to make the whole thing operate. This program, along with Drought Force, represents important extensions of our response. They will help regional communities carry through what are unquestionably extraordinarily difficult times.I want to touch on one other thing. There are many people out there providing counselling services because drought can be extraordinarily stressful. It is not just the financial impact for many families; it is the difficulties day after day of the grinding work of trying to keep livestock alive and families intact. As has been quite widely recorded, many people are now facing very real personal stress. They have been greatly ground down. Today's announcement will go a long way to providing some heart and cheer to those people. I want to commend to members of the House, their staff and others who may be dealing with people ringing in or meeting people suffering great stress the fact that Lifeline have put together what they call a Tool Kit for Getting Through the Drought. We had a little launch of this last Friday. It is a tool kit that offers very valuable advice on how to recognise the symptoms of stress. It provides ideas on ways to deal with it, whether it is looking at financial options, looking out for your children and loved ones, or simply looking after your own physical and mental health. The kit is available from Lifeline on their JUST ASK service on 1300 13 11 14, from Lifeline directly or from my office. For the interest of the House, I table the kit. </DOC>

 - As I have indicated in the last two answers, the government has put together a very comprehensive package to take our aviation safety further ahead building on what has already been done. I find it extraordinary that people in this House would reject the work of agencies right across the nation which has obviously been very substantial. -  - I just heard the comment `haven't done anything'. - The first question was about the ANAO. As I said in response to that, without pre-empting their report, in their discussions and interactions with me, they have gone so far as to say and acknowledge that enormous response capabilities were put in place after September 11. Indeed, they were. I was Acting Prime Minister at the time of that very unfortunate event. By the time the airlines and airports started operating the very next morning, our agencies that you apparently now want to so willingly disparage -  - I again make the point that it is absurd, alarming, misleading and simply not true to say that nothing is being done or that we have not responded at all times very quickly to intelligence reports and risk assessments. I think it is important that this House understand that. It is important that the travelling public understand that. We do not in any way play lightly with the safety and the security of Australians and never will. That ought to be clearly put before people.In terms of further security arrangements, I have to say to the House that the government have prepared and are about to start implementing a major further round of measures. We will be very shortly announcing what those measures in broad will be and how they will be funded. But I am not going to pre-empt the government's processes in that regard. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The Prime Minister has today announced a range of new and additional measures to help Australian farmers facing drought. Those measures are on top of the interim announcements of support made in September and are, of course, in addition to the exceptional circumstances assistance that remains in place to help farmers in times of drought and during the recovery period. Collectively, these announcements represent the most comprehensive drought assistance package ever provided for Australian farmers in times of need. The amount of money that will be committed to this relief demonstrates the clear commitment of this government to the farmers of Australia and our determination to help them through these difficult times. Eligible farmers in areas like the Riverina will be able to apply from today for income assistance measures, and the other measures announced by the Prime Minister also apply from today.One of the interesting elements of this announcement - which I think will be especially of interest to members like the member for Riverina - is the fact that farmers do not have to wait for their state to make an application for an exceptional circumstances declaration. This assistance is available to all farmers in areas that meet the nine-month rainfall deficiency between March and November 2002. So many farmers will be eligible for benefits even though their state has not bothered to lodge an EC application in their interests. In fact, as the Prime Minister mentioned, in a state like New South Wales, where so many farmers meet the nine-month rainfall deficiency criteria, all farmers in the entire state who meet the eligibility criteria will be able to receive this income support.It is also significant that two other important announcements have been made today. Farmers in those same areas will be eligible for some assistance with loans that they need to take out to help them with feeding their livestock or other measures to cope with the current drought. In addition, small businesses in EC declared areas will, for the first time, have access to some government assistance. This is also a major breakthrough and will benefit those already declared EC areas around Australia. These benefits will cover a very significant part of Australia. The map that I have here will perhaps help honourable members to realise that a very large part of Australia meets the nine-month rainfall deficiency criteria. If the statistical local area meets that criteria, all farmers in that region will be eligible for the assistance. This covers a very large proportion of the continent of Australia and will benefit all mainland states. There will not be any benefits going to Tasmania because, fortunately, they are in an even better position - they have had above average rainfall.This represents a very significant addition to the support available to farmers. I encourage those who believe they are eligible to contact their local Centrelink office or, if that is not convenient for them, to phone 13 23 16 and they can commence the process of applying for this assistance. Even if farmers are not able to apply today or they need a little time to get their applications together, the payments can be backdated to today - so farmers who are eligible will not miss out. This is a very warm and comprehensive response. It represents, as the Prime Minister indicated, a commitment of more than a billion dollars from the federal government towards drought assistance. That compares with the $55 million - the total of $55 million - that the states have so far committed between themselves. - They have committed $55 million between them, and they have paid probably only a trickle of that. It is time that the states followed the federal government's lead and provided real, helpful and meaningful support to farmers in these difficult times. </DOC>

 - One foreign ship worker jumping is one too many. The point I make at the outset is that it is against the law; we do not allow for it. I also make two other points. Our shipping policy does not favour foreign crews. You can only get a CVP or a SVP if there is no suitable Australian vessel available - a policy you yourself confirmed you would continue at a recent shipping conference. It also ought to be remembered that the very great bulk of Australian coastal trade is still carried in Australian bottoms. If you are really serious about Australian shipping being competitive, the first thing you would do would be to talk to the MUA about crew revolving, insurance, workers compensation and those sorts of matters. With your cooperation, we might be able to secure a stronger future for the Australian shipping industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. Some members of the House may recall that, when this government came to office, a self-funded retiree who was on the same income as a pensioner paid more tax - that is, if you were a pensioner on the same income as a self-funded retiree you got a tax rebate, but the self-funded retiree who did not earn one dollar more paid tax. This government introduced a policy that gave the self-funded retiree the same tax benefits as the pensioner on the same amount of income. I must say that it was very warmly welcomed by the self-funded retirees of Australia.In 2001 the government announced that the benefits to senior Australians - for pensioners and self-funded retirees - would be improved. The senior Australians' tax offset was introduced for the 2000-01 financial year. The year 2001-02 was the second year that it applied. I inform the House that in this financial year, 422,000 Australians have benefited from that senior Australians' tax offset - that is 422,000 older Australians have received a tax cut of, on average, $1,953. Those tax cuts for older Australians will give them an opportunity that was denied them under Labor. Over the two years of the scheme, the amount returned to older Australians has been $1.3 billion.A single older Australian can have an income of up to $20,000 under the senior Australians' tax offset and not pay any tax at all. The offset begins to phase out after $20,000 and, by the time they are on $37,840, they will pay full tax. A couple can earn up to $32,612 and pay no tax at all, and the offset begins to phase out after that. When their joint income reaches $58,244, couples will pay full tax. These very significant reductions in taxation for senior Australians were put in place by this government when it came to office, and they were extended in 2001. The government is now returning a bit of tax to the seniors in our community - whom our community should value - to enable them in this period of their lives to live better on their savings and investments and to have a better standard of life. These are real benefits for older Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it gives me the chance to repeat - as I have done in this House on numbers of occasions - that people should be very careful of the effect the petrol they use has on the warranties on their cars. If those warranties are contingent upon not allowing ethanol above a certain level in the tank, it is very important that people adhere to those warranties. I have also informed the House that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and Environment Australia are looking at the regulations specifying maximums in relation to ethanol. They will no doubt be taking scientific evidence into account before making a recommendation. I very much look forward to the recommendation that the minister intends to bring in relation to this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question, and I appreciate his interest. As I think all members of the House would know, on Saturday night Iraq handed over roughly 12,000 pages of information to the United Nations on various programs, consistent with its requirement, under Security Council resolution 1441 to declare weapons of mass destruction. We note that Iraq has handed over these documents, but no-one as yet has read them; therefore, by definition, we have not. The material will arrive in New York today. Experts at UNMOVIC and the IAEA will analyse the material once it has been received, and it will be quite some days before they can make any qualitative judgments about the veracity of the declaration that Iraq has made. A particular challenge, clearly, will be to sort through information on dual use items, which are presented as being for civilian use only. Of course, this has been a longstanding issue.Iraq has always presented the seemingly benign use of these items as the raison d'etre for a particular factory or a particular facility, but these items can easily be put to a despicable use if the intent to do so exists. We all know from the history of Iraq that the intent to do so does indeed exist. Whether or not the declaration will be made available to the generality of United Nations members will be a matter for judgment by the United Nations Security Council. It is possible that the declaration will contain a good deal of sensitive information on how to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, or at least that could be discerned from the documents, and therefore pose a proliferation risk if those aspects of the documents were to be made public. It would indeed be an unwelcome development if Iraq's declaration were to add to the threat of weapons of mass destruction by providing vital information to would-be proliferators. These are the sorts of questions that UNMOVIC, the IAEA and the Security Council will have to look at. In the meantime, UNMOVIC and the IAEA will work through the declaration and we can afford to be a little patient.I would say that Iraq's continuing claims, which it made again on Saturday, that it has no weapons of mass destruction at all are not encouraging and simply lack credibility. It is hard to believe that Saddam Hussein has spent the last four years getting rid of his weapons of mass destruction and his delivery capabilities. His past actions and preparedness to use chemical and biological weapons clearly suggest the opposite. As I said here in the House on 17 September, and as the US and the UK have spelt out in their dossiers, intelligence points to continuing attempts to acquire material for ongoing weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery programs.  UNSCOM inspectors left Iraq at the end of 1998 unable to account for 360 tonnes of chemical warfare agents, chemical precursors for making VX nerve agent, over 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical and biological agents and the full extent of Iraq's biological weapons program. If the 7 December declaration is found to be fundamentally flawed or there are serious omissions, then resolution 1441 provides for the Security Council to discuss this issue. The burden of proof remains on Saddam Hussein to convince the international community that he is abiding by Security Council resolutions and that he has destroyed Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capability. The international community expects and demands of Saddam Hussein nothing other than an unambiguous declaration supported by verification and a demonstration of full and continuous cooperation.</DOC>

 - I have a copy of the transcript of the Senate inquiry and I will read what Mr Cassidy said:We spoke to various independent authorities. We also spoke to the various players in the industry and I have to say it was a very mixed story. People like the motor vehicle manufacturers, for argument's sake, said that they thought anything above 10 per cent was potentially a problem. But then there were others in the industry who pointed to overseas practice and who argued that you could certainly go up to 20 per cent.Apparently the overseas practice is 20 per cent -  - Mr Speaker, he asked me about the evidence and I am actually reading out the evidence. Unfortunately for him, he is not able to misrepresent it because we actually have it. When I read it out he starts disputing the evidence. The essence of your question is actually to support this evidence. That was the essence of the question. The evidence was that the motor car manufacturers think anything above 10 per cent is a problem. Others in the industry who rely on overseas practice argue that you can go to 20 per cent. Mr Cassidy went on to say:Between 10 per cent and 20 per cent there was quite a deal of conflicting evidence.So we have conflicting scientific evidence as to whether 10 per cent is the maximum or whether you can go to 20 per cent. No doubt that is argued by people on various scientific grounds. What is the government's position? The government's position is that Environment Australia, which is responsible for this area, is charged with looking at the scientific evidence and making a recommendation. I must confess I am not a scientific expert on whether or not a car can take 10 per cent or 20 per cent ethanol. This is beyond my ken. If I could resolve the scientific evidence, I would, but I cannot. Which is the appropriate body to resolve the scientific evidence? Environment Australia. What is happening? Environment Australia is making a recommendation. When Environment Australia makes a recommendation, the government presumably will accept or reject it, and the matter will be dealt with in that way. But for anybody to intervene and say that they know, without a proper evaluation of the scientific evidence, would not be right and it would not be a proper process. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and the opportunity to update the House on where we are in relation to unauthorised border arrivals. As of today, we have four unauthorised boat arrivals awaiting a primary decision, and it is important to recognise the reasons for that. It is because there are potentially serious character issues and we are going through a natural justice process in each case before a final decision is taken. In matters of this sort where we have been able to achieve such decisions in quite short time frames, I can confirm to the House that 90 per cent of our caseload has been processed in approximately 17 weeks. But, when we know who people are and are able to get documentation readily from them as to who they are and where they are from, those claims have been able to be dealt with in as few as four or five weeks.It is interesting that the opposition are proposing that that all ought to be able to be done in a 90-day regime. I found it quite fascinating that they said that they would achieve a 90-day turnaround. By implicit criticism of the government, they said, `We will implement a better security and character checking system, because the government only initiates security checking when an asylum seeker's identity has been established.' I ask you: how do you speed up the process if what you are saying is, `We're going to do security checking before we know who they are'? I find it extraordinary that you can mount a criticism based upon the government wanting to know who people are before starting security checking.It is important to recognise that the Labor Party have had experience in relation to these matters. Some nine or 10 years ago, they attempted to impose a 273-day time frame, I think it was, in which to process onshore arrivals. They included with it a clock so that you could take into account when people were not being cooperative. When people stopped providing information you might need, the clock was not to run. They had not taken into account the way in which the courts might deal with these matters. The courts said that you could do something else when you thought the clock had stopped. What we found was that, even with 273 days, they eventually had claims from so-called asylum seekers for damages for false arrest because they had been held beyond the time that was permitted by the clock. They want to introduce a 90-day time frame and they expect that it will all be able to be done in that time and not be the subject of litigation.As a result of a range of measures that have been put in place by the government, we now have the situation where people do not seem to be getting into boats and risking their lives - and sometimes the lives of their wives and children - in coming to Australia. The opposition think you can cherry pick in relation to this range of measures, which I assert have all had an impact. One of the important measures has been the temporary protection visa regime, because it has made it less attractive for people to seek to come here than to apply properly overseas where they may get a more beneficial result. The temporary protection measure regime is a very important part of the total package. Absolutely essential for ensuring that you are able to deal with these issues are effective mandatory detention, the integrity measures in relation to processing and the provision of excision for Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef and the Cocos islands. It would be enhanced very considerably if you had further excisions in relation to the Coral Sea -   - Yes, absolutely; the Coral Sea islands and the Torres Strait islands. I am glad that the shadow minister is nodding agreement. The excision measures in their totality are absolutely essential for that. The removal of access to our generous judicial review system; the introduction of the privative clause; the multilateral and bilateral engagement we have had with countries in the region; the enhanced regional cooperation that we have achieved with countries in the region; the return agreement, such as that we have had with Afghanistan; the return of unauthorised boat arrivals where they have been able to be achieved; and the implementation of the Pacific solution are all measures which have had an impact. Yet the opposition think that you can cherry pick. They think you can take some and say, `Oh well, it will still work. You can send a signal to the people smugglers that you are going to wind back some of these initiatives and it will not have any impact.' The impact of our measures has been that from today it has been a year since the last boat was received on any Australian territory. On that occasion, a Sri Lankan vessel arrived at the Cocos islands. A year ago, two more boats after that sought to come to Australia - on 11 and 17 December - which were returned to Indonesia. The fact is that our successes are on the board. We have been able to save lives. We have been able to implement policy that has been effective. The only alternative policy being advanced is one that is designed to unwind those measures and give succour to people smugglers again.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. Can I inform him and the House that an additional one million Australian children will receive free meningococcal C vaccine next year as part of the government's National Meningococcal C Vaccination Program. An increase in the availability of this vaccine has meant that more Australian children will be able to be protected through the scheme and protected from the disease earlier than had been anticipated. Over the next four years the government has increased its funding for the program from $101 million, as announced in August of this year, to $291 million. The program will be rolled out over the next four years. During 2003, children aged one to five years will be vaccinated via general practitioners, and adolescents aged 15 to 19 will be vaccinated through schools. Following this, children aged six to 14 years will be vaccinated at school in the years 2003-04 and 2004-05. As well as providing a catch-up dose of meningococcal C vaccine for all Australians aged one to 19 over the next few years, it is proposed that the meningococcal C vaccine will be added to the Australian standard vaccination schedule at 12 months of age.It is important to note that there is no effective vaccine available for the group B meningococcal disease, so it is imperative that parents and clinicians remain vigilant in looking out for the signs of meningococcal disease even if children have been vaccinated. This is part of the government's program to bring vaccinations to a much greater proportion of the Australian population. In 1996, when we came to government, Australia's full immunisation rate was only 53 per cent - well below countries such as China, Algeria, Laos and Vietnam. The government is proud of the fact that by September this year over 91 per cent of 12- to 15-month-old children were fully immunised. This is what the government's meningococcal vaccination program is all about - ensuring better health for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I remember answering questions on that. I will have to check the transcript to see if the Leader of the Opposition has correctly represented me. Even if he has on this occasion done so, nothing he has put to me gainsays what the Treasurer has been saying. We have invited Environment Australia, which is the expert body, to give us advice. This is a very interesting proposition of government: you make a decision to invite Environment Australia to make a judgment, to give you some scientific advice, and then you ignore it. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, you and your colleagues on the front bench are missing, as you so often do, the point. The point is that we have invited Environment Australia to give us some scientific advice. When we get that scientific advice, armed with the expert advice we will make a decision. Nothing difficult, nothing complicated, nothing conspiratorial - it is plain, straightforward commonsense, which obviously eludes the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. Today the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is releasing its report Exports of primary and manufactured products Australia 2001-02. That report indicates that total exports of manufactured and primary products stood at $113.7 billion in 2001-02. Manufactured goods have increased from $22.1 billion in 1995-96 to $32.4 billion in 2001-02, which is a 30 per cent growth. The member for Cowper would recognise that this is also very important in his electorate. These are not just manufactured goods that are going directly into markets; they are also manufactured goods that are going into industries that are building and developing in Australia because we are selling other products.The member for Cowper and I had the opportunity recently of participating in a celebration in Coffs Harbour of local company WE Smith Hudson exporting from New South Wales to Western Australia four 200-tonne heat exchanges to build the fourth train of the LNG project in the North West Shelf. As a result of the North West Shelf getting the $25 billion gas deal up with China, there is a chance that they might build a fifth train, and WE Smith Hudson, in the member for Cowper's electorate, might get more contracts to build more heat exchanges and sustain the 106 jobs in that business.We as a government have been putting in place not just trade policies that focus on growth but also an economic framework that is very conducive to and competitive for Australia's manufacturing industries. One of the other standout industries, as far as our exports are concerned, is the motor vehicle industry. Motor vehicle exports during the reporting period have risen to $2.9 billion. That is for fully built motor vehicles. If you add automotive components to that, exports from the auto sector are now worth over $5 billion. That industry employs over 54,000 people in Australia. They are forecasting that between now and 2010 they will grow their export base to $10 billion. As I indicated, the policies of our government have seen expansion in the export sector, significant growth in terms of our output and, therefore, increased jobs. During the life of our government - since 1996 - there have been a million new jobs created in our economy. Almost 200,000 of those are in the export sector, as a result of the growth in Australian exports. So it is a good news report. I will table it so that members can peruse the statistics it contains. On our side of the House, we are focusing on generating jobs in Australia for all Australians. We would ask the members of the Australian Labor Party to focus on doing the same thing so that they are not just focusing on one job - his job - but on jobs for all Australians, for real Australians outside. That is what we have been focusing on: jobs in the member for Cowper's electorate.</DOC>

The memorandum referred to was of course in relation to the sugar industry. Nothing that I said a moment ago in answer to the other question countermands anything that is contained in that answer. But, once again, the Leader of the Opposition misses the point. The answers given by the Treasurer and by others over a period of time, and again today, and the answers given by me indicate that Environment Australia have been commissioned to do a study on this issue. - When that study has been received, we will then have available to us their considered view. But if the Leader of the Opposition equates a coordination comment in a cabinet memorandum with the results of a considered study, we now have further evidence as to why he sits over there.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I know he has a great deal of concern for doing the right thing by Indigenous people in North Queensland, as does the member for Leichhardt, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Let me remind the House of something that was said late last year by Noel Pearson:Almost all of our other social and health problems are derivative of our grog and drug problem: we solve grog and drugs, we will solve everything else, or at least be on our way to solving them.There has been so much focus on Indigenous problems that it is only right and proper that we should also appreciate and recognise Indigenous success. I am very pleased to tell the House that the people of Arakun, which is the largest Indigenous community on Cape York, have made a decisive step towards reclaiming responsibility for the community and reclaiming responsibility for their own lives. The people of Arakun have used the powers available to them under Queensland law to have alcohol banned from that community except for certain limited hours of service in the local tavern. Alcohol is being banned from private homes, Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike, because there cannot be one rule for permanent residents and another rule for people there on employment contracts. Pregnant women and their partners, people on probation, people subject to domestic violence orders and people whose children are truant from the local school will all be refused alcohol service. I have to point out that it is one thing to make this decision, but it is another thing to make it work. It is not going to be easy to cope with the sly grog runners who will inevitably try to penetrate the community. It will not necessarily be easy to cope with a reduction in community income because of lower alcohol sales. This is a giant step towards tackling one of the greatest social scourges that Indigenous communities face. Less alcohol abuse means better health. It means more tranquil communities. It means stronger family budgets. It has important spin-offs for employment and education. One of the best things about what has happened in Arakun is that it is not something which governments have imposed on Indigenous people. This is a genuine example of grassroots leadership. This is an example of Indigenous people taking responsibility for their own lives. I think it is only right that this House congratulates Noel Pearson, the Cape York Partnership and the Arakun Council, but, most of all, the women of the Arakun community justice group, who are responsible for the leadership behind this important breakthrough.</DOC>

 - It is because you have established no such thing. After asking a number of questions and drawing blanks -  - Yes, drawing blanks. He then gets up and says, `Now that we've done this and we've done that and that, what about this?' What has come out of these questions essentially is this: there is a scientific argument and, in order for that scientific argument to be worked through, Environment Australia, the responsible agency, has been asked to consider the scientific evidence. After Environment Australia considers the scientific evidence -  - its minister is responsible for making a recommendation to the cabinet, and after the responsible minister brings it to the cabinet -  - the cabinet makes a decision and, after the cabinet makes a decision, it makes an announcement with a view to implementing that decision. He then says in his question, `Why don't you make a decision before you've gone through the scientific process? Why don't you do it on an interim basis?' The reason we do not do these things on an interim basis is that it might be wrong. Normally, one gets the scientific evidence before one makes the decision.  - One of the reasons the taxpayer funds organisations like Environment Australia to do scientific research is so that it informs the government. I have always found it good practice, when dealing with a scientific issue, to get the scientific report first, rather than make the decision and then ask for the report afterwards. That is essentially what scientific method is all about: one actually goes and considers the empirical evidence, one comes to the conclusion, one makes a recommendation and a decision is made. That is the proper process for government. That is the process this government will follow. The government will make its decision on the basis of the scientific research, and any suggestion by the Labor Party to the contrary is absolutely false. We had those false accusations put before us back in September. They were false then. They are false now. The government is following due process and the government will make its decision accordingly.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Mitchell. He is a longstanding member of this parliament and he has a very keen interest in work and family issues, particularly the welfare of children. As he well knows, the coalition's record when it comes to child care is exemplary. We have committed $8 billion over the next four years, and we know that over the last six years we have spent 70 per cent more than Labor did in their last six years of government. We have a direct interest in, and great concern about, the area of quality and regulation. I think all parents, for their peace of mind, want to be reassured when they leave their child in a Commonwealth funded child-care facility that adequate quality assurance and regulations are in place. When it comes to licensing and regulation, they are clearly the area of the states and territories. Along with our record allocation in the area of outside school hours care, we are interested to see quality assurance - just as we have done in long day care recently, when tougher provisions came in, and family day care as well - to ensure that maximum quality is maintained in Commonwealth funded outside school hours care.I must admit that I was concerned by some statements in the Daily Telegraph today. I know that the member for Mitchell, after meeting many providers in his electorate not so long ago, was concerned about the role the states and territories have in licensing and regulation. They do have that jurisdiction and they do have those responsibilities. These are regulations regarding the qualifications of staff, staff-child ratios and of course the physical environment. I compliment the ACT government because they were the first territory to introduce regulations for outside school hours care. We want to see other states bringing forward regulations. Queensland will do it and Western Australia will do it, but I was quite surprised to read about New South Wales in the paper today. I quote from a leading paper, the Daily Telegraph, where it says:Tens of thousands of NSW school children attend unregulated after-school care centres where no one checks staff numbers or safety and suitability of buildings.	...     	...	     ...After-school care providers have been campaigning for regulation for more than a decade as they want parents to have confidence in the sector. That is fair enough. It continues:But the State Government has refused to pay the $17 million to set up a regulatory system, despite having the responsibility to oversee long day care.Community Services Minister Carmel Tebutt's spokesman said it was the Federal Government's responsibility to regulate child care.That is clearly not the case. We do not have the responsibility to regulate child care, particularly outside school hours care. It is high time some state governments stopped cost shifting to the Commonwealth. In the area of early childhood care, particularly preschools, there has been no funding increase in the state of New South Wales for over a decade. Indeed, they now have a lower amount of funding for preschools than any other state. To a large extent, the only checks and balances they are interested in when it comes to after school hours care is the cheque that is coming from the Commonwealth through child-care benefit. They are more interested in the bottom line than they are in the quality of care. There is no doubt that we have played our part. There has been a 221 per cent increase in outside school hours care. I want to introduce quality assurance programs for outside school hours care next year, but the states must introduce regulations as a matter of urgency and not try to pretend it is a Commonwealth responsibility or cost shift to the Commonwealth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question, which I know covers a subject of interest to all members of this House. The House will recall that on 16 October an inquiry to be conducted by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Mr Bill Blick, was requested by me to determine whether any warning of the Bali attacks might have been possible from the intelligence material available to the government. The terms of reference for the inquiry, conducted under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act, were set out in a letter to Mr Blick from me on 23 October. They were: to review all relevant intelligence available to Australian intelligence and security agencies and associated intelligence assessment processes, to establish whether there was any information that warned of the bomb attack in Bali on 12 October 2002 and to propose relevant recommendations in the light of Mr Blick's findings. It was subsequently agreed that Mr Blick would also review Australian Federal Police information, in addition to intelligence reporting, to establish whether this might have provided any warning of the attack.Mr Blick wrote to me yesterday, on 9 December, to report the results of his inquiry so far. Mr Blick noted that he had extensively reviewed the intelligence records of the relevant agencies to identify information of possible relevance to the inquiry. His initial report notes that it does not cover some foreign language intelligence material collected in the period shortly before the Bali attack that needs more detailed examination. In Mr Blick's judgment this material is unlikely to contain relevant information, but to exclude this possibility the inspector-general will examine the material in detail. This will take some time and a second and final report will be provided when this process is completed. I table two unclassified extracts from the inspector-general's report. The first is the introduction and a summary of his findings. The second is an annex containing intelligence agency responsibilities. I offer the Leader of the Opposition a briefing on the full report and a personal opportunity for him to read that report in full. Parts of the report are highly classified and include the original text of key intelligence reports.The core conclusion of the inspector-general's inquiry, subject to the further work I have mentioned, is that there was no intelligence warning of the 12 October terrorist attacks in Bali. As I indicated to the parliament on 16 October, and as Mr Blick notes, one intelligence report obtained from foreign liaison sources mentioned various places, including Bali, as possible locations of terrorist activity. Such activity was dependent upon certain specified circumstances. Those circumstances did not eventuate in the time between receipt of the intelligence and the attack in Bali on 12 October. The inspector-general goes on to observe that he has been advised that it is clear from the Bali investigations that these circumstances were not relevant to the Bali attack. The report further notes that no other intelligence was received that specified Bali as a likely or possible location for a terrorist attack. Indeed, the inspector-general concludes that, even with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of possible and likely perpetrators, the inquiry could not construe any intelligence, even intelligence not mentioning Bali, as possibly providing warning of an attack. As I indicated earlier, I also invited Mr Blick to propose relevant recommendations in the light of his findings. Mr Blick has indicated that he does not believe any recommendations are necessary.</DOC>

 - Things aren't going so well for me today, Mr Speaker. - A veteran foreign affairs minister; that is right. Thank you, Prime Minister. I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. She is the chair of the government's backbench foreign affairs committee and obviously has a great interest in issues within the region.It is hardly surprising that the government warmly welcomes the peace agreement between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement, which is known as GAM. The agreement is an important step forward, we hope, in bringing to an end the hostilities that have plagued Aceh now for very many years. The agreement does provide for the cessation of hostilities, an international cease-fire monitoring group and participation in the 2004 elections in which GAM members will be able to run for election. Australia would urge all leaders and their communities to embrace this new chance with the optimism it deserves. Clearly, we are not sure, but we very much hope that the agreement will prove to be the success that it deserves to be.I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Indonesian government: in particular, President Megawati; Bambang Yudhoyono, the coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs; and Hassan Wirayuda, the foreign minister, on their extraordinarily hard work; and also the Henri Dunant Centre for its valuable work in bringing the parties together. The Australian government will do what it can to assist this peace process. We will contribute $2 million towards the implementation of the peace agreement at this stage. Our contribution will help fund an international cease-fire monitoring group. The group will have a key role in monitoring the adherence of the parties, the Indonesian government and GAM, to their undertakings under the peace agreement. Foreign Minister Wirayuda has written to me already thanking Australia for its contribution and noting his government's continuing commitment to ending the conflict in Aceh. We are pleased to be part of an international effort which is supporting the excellent efforts of both parties as they move towards reconciling the conflict that has affected so many people for so long. Let me just reiterate, in conclusion, the commonly spoken position of the Australian government that we support Indonesia's unity, we support Indonesia's territorial integrity and we support its efforts to resolve its internal difficulties through both dialogue and negotiation. The peace agreement and the special autonomy law for Aceh are important steps towards securing a durable political solution but within the framework of something that we strongly support - and that is a united Indonesia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. He numbers amongst those with scientific or engineering qualifications in this place; hence his special interest in all things science and innovation. Following on from the Prime Minister's announcement last week of national priorities, the government announced today a record amount of funding for the cooperative research centres program of $480 million for 30 cooperative research centre grants. Especially important is the fact that this new funding flows from Backing Australia's Ability, the government's innovation strategy. It is an unstoppable bandwagon and the opposition would be well advised to jump on board, and we would welcome them.The CRCs, cooperative research centres, bring together universities, research agencies and industry in a cooperative way for material outcomes for commercialisation of intellectual property -  - and allow Australia to maintain its competitive leading edge technology, and provide businesses with opportunities to work with research institutions and to focus on research relevant to Australia's needs. This round of funding will benefit a wide range of sectors, and a number of ministers have been supportive and have encouraged applications for funding from within their areas of responsibility. The environment sector will receive more than $145 million; medical science more than $80 million; and mining and energy more than $68 million. The member for Dobell, who has been involved in the invention as a designer of high voltage switch gear, will be particularly interested in the boost to energy technology. He has also been involved in their manufacture. Information and communication technology will receive $46 million and manufacturing technology will receive $15 million. Amongst all of the worthwhile cooperative research centres announced today was $110 million for a bushfire national research centre, into which the Commonwealth will inject $25 million. This is the first time that dispersed researchers in universities, CSIRO and state agencies will come together and work in total collaboration with the end users - the firefighting agencies. Every state and territory is represented and has invested very heavily in this new national bushfire research centre. Importantly, because the profile of the fire researchers is ageing, up to 40 postgraduate students will work with the centre over the next few years and get a degree in fire research.I wish to thank all of the researchers both in government agencies and in universities who have joined with business partners to make applications and succeeded. They are adding to the social and economic prosperity of our nation. I close with a thank you to Dr Geoff Vaughan, chairman of the CRC selection committee, and his colleagues for their hard work and their application in this demanding task. When the Prime Minister made the announcement on national priorities last week, he said that it was evidence of the government placing science and technology at the crossroads of all government activity and of the supreme importance we attach to science and innovation. Today's announcement gives effect to those words.</DOC>

 - Obviously, as the Minister for Defence, the former member for Flinders would have had access to an enormous number of things. Whether he had access to this particular information, without inquiry I have no way of either -  - I have no way of either confirming or denying that. It is self-evidently something that would have to be the subject of inquiry and I do not intend to confirm or deny it without making inquiry. Could I just remind the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the time line in relation to this matter. The DIDS project had its genesis in the Defence Efficiency Review of 1997. The tender documentation relating to the original DIDS tender was issued in November of 1999 when the former member for Ryan was the defence minister. The government decided on or about 9 July, or late in June or early in July, to discontinue that tender process. As to exactly when the payments of $1 million were made, I do not know. I would imagine that they were made fairly soon afterwards. That was in July. Mr Reith, to my understanding, did not join Tenix until around about December or perhaps January of this year - I do not know the exact date. I have not seen it as something that I should carry around in my mind. The fundamental point about the whole of this is that Tenix was selected ultimately as the result of a competitive tender process. Unless the opposition can provide some evidence of wrongdoing by the former minister, this assumes nothing other than the vendetta the Labor Party are conducting against a very able former minister. I know he did you a lot of damage when he was a minister, and I know the Labor Party remember the former member for Flinders very well because he hit you very hard where it hurts. That is why. This has nothing to do with principle. They have never got over April 1998, when Peter Reith was prepared to do something that preceding industrial relations ministers on both sides of politics had lacked the courage to do. You pursue Peter Reith because you hate anybody on our side of politics who has the courage and the capacity to break the stranglehold of the unions. - As I told the House last week, the government decided to discontinue the tender process in late June or early July of last year, as the result of a cabinet deliberation, on the basis that it did not provide sufficient opportunity to allow tenderers to offer innovative solutions in accordance with commercial best practice, nor did it sufficiently recognise the importance of maintaining jobs in rural and regional Australia. That is the reason it was terminated. I remember the process very well. There were a number of members representing rural and regional electorates, and most of them were on our side of the House because we are the only two parties that have an interest in it. The reason we discontinued the old process was that there was insufficient regard being paid. That is the reason. It had nothing to do with the particular preferences of the former defence minister. This is of a piece with the grubby obsession of the opposition with somebody who inflicted immense political damage on them because he had the courage and the backbone to stand up for the interests of ordinary Australians and was not willing to bow to sectional, union driven interest groups.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. When you think of the challenges the Australian economy faces these days with international weakness, with the threat of terrorism and war, and with a very severe drought, it manages to show considerable resilience. Today the NAB monthly business survey reported that business conditions remained resilient in November. The National Australia Bank said that the survey is reporting levels of business activity that are still considerably north of four per cent annualised growth in the non-farm sector - which I think members will welcome - and that the non-farm sector is showing considerable resilience, notwithstanding a very severe drought, which is detracting from overall growth and leading to declining farm incomes. In addition to that, the Australian Industry Group survey of manufacturing for the December quarter found a strengthening in manufacturing activity, with a net balance of 24 per cent of firms reporting higher production, which was the strongest result since 1994. So manufacturing continues to show resilience as well. I think people on both sides of the House will welcome that.About a fortnight ago, I was at a meeting of the G20 - the 20 countries systemically important to the world financial system - in Delhi. Anne Krueger, the deputy managing director, was interviewed after that meeting. She said this - a very interesting observation:I keep telling people the world economy is not as bad as they think. They look at Japan, the US and Europe and forget some of the small industrialised countries such as Australia and Canada which are doing well.So we have the deputy managing director of the IMF now saying that maybe Japan, Europe and America are not doing so well but the bright spot out there is the Australian economy.We had the national accounts last week, which also confirmed, notwithstanding drought, resilience. I note that the Labor Party are yet to ask a question about the national accounts which were released last week and are yet to ask a question about the mid-year review which was released the week before. I guess nothing could be a greater testament to the resilience of the Australian economy than the fact that the Labor Party have fallen silent in asking questions in relation to it.I thought that the House might be interested in the Economist magazine and the forecast that it has this week. The Economist poll forecast Australia to lead the growth stakes in 2002 and 2003. Seeing as this is an important cricket day, I know the Prime Minister will welcome this statement. The Economist magazine said this week:Australia is doing well not just on the cricket pitch but in the growth league: it heads the table of all 15 countries both this year and next.I think in all fairness we could say of the British that their economy is doing better than their cricket team, which was 8-150 a short time ago. The British economy is strong by European standards, forecast to grow at 1.6 per cent in 2002 and 2.5 per cent in 2003. So Britain is certainly stronger than most of the European economies, but Australia is leading not only in cricket but also in terms of growth.Having said that, it is a difficult period. The drought in particular is of concern to Australian growth prospects. But the non-farm GDP continues to show resilience and part of that is the changes that this government put in place over the last seven years, in particular the new tax system, which was the best thing to happen to the manufacturing industry because we took the indirect tax burden off manufacturing and gave manufacturing a much better go. We recall that the Australian Labor Party said tax reform would ruin the Australian economy. We recall the member for Hotham with his Hockey Bear pyjamas and his salads in plastic bags telling us that, if we reformed the taxation system, we would be in recession. Eighteen months after the reform of the Australian tax system, Australia leads the world.There is a phrase you do not hear much about in this parliament any more. I have not heard the `r' word for quite some time. Let us remind them what it was: rollback. We have not heard `rollback' for the last 18 months or so, and no wonder. It was cheapjack opportunism, better forgotten and better buried, along with the economic policy of the member for Hotham.</DOC>

 - In relation to the last part of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, whenever it is appropriate for me to provide additional information to the House I will. I am aware of that obligation. The cancellation occurred either early in July or late June. I will find out precisely the date. It is true that Mr Reith announced his intention not to recontest around that time. It is also true that Mr Reith informed me some six or nine months earlier than the announcement that there was a possibility. In fact, he informed me at the time I appointed him Defence minister that there was a possibility that for a combination of family and personal reasons he might not contest.But what I find particularly illuminating about this is this new-found passion for ministers not ever taking commercial positions. I did not hear people complaining about the former minister for communications Senator Richardson taking a high-profile position. I do not criticise him for it - let me make it perfectly clear that I do not. I do not criticise Graham Richardson for what he did. What I criticise is your hypocrisy.Graham Richardson joined Publishing and Broadcasting in 1994. He took a bit of time off to write a book, which I remember reviewing - it did not take long - and he joined PBL pretty soon after that. I do not remember the Leader of the Opposition criticising John Kerin, who was a minister between 1983 and -  - Thank you very much - `Out of the mouths ...' This is nothing other than a personal vendetta against Peter Reith. You have demonstrated out of your own mouth with that stupid interjection that this is what it is all about. Thank you very much, Lindsay Tanner.Government members - No, it was Gavie. - Oh, it was Gavie - I am sorry. I thank the member for Corio. I thank him very, very warmly. If you have a meeting of the tactics committee, you should keep the discussion to yourself; you should not come in here and say, `Let's continue the vendetta against Peter Reith.' This is a vendetta against a man who laid you low on industrial relations, and that is why you are carrying on this campaign. Nobody in the Labor Party objected about John Kerin taking positions with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation -  - Midfield Meat Management, the CRC for Temperate Hardwood Forestry, the CRC for Australian Weed Management, and Biologic International. Let me say, I think John Kerin is a very fine person. I think he was a person of integrity. I did not agree with his politics on a lot of things, but I have no complaint about him taking on those positions any more than I have got any complaint about Graham Richardson. I have a complaint against a Labor Party that cannot get over the fact that, in Peter Reith, they have somebody who had the courage to do something to clean up the Australian waterfront. The Australian waterfront had needed reform for years and, in Peter Reith, Australia at long last found somebody who had the intestinal fortitude to do it. The strength of the Australian economy, of which the Treasurer spoke so eloquently a few moments ago, is owed in part to the industrial relations reforms of Peter Reith, of which the reform of the Australian waterfront bulks very large. That is why you are carrying on this vendetta, as confirmed by the member for Corio with his very helpful interjection. This is why you are carrying on this vendetta - it has nothing to do with principle; it has got everything to do with the fact that you cannot get over the fact that Reith hit you hard where it hurt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. His constituents are amongst the many who have benefited from the announcements that the federal government made yesterday to provide $368 million of additional assistance to drought-stricken farmers around Australia. The package includes immediate income support and interest rate subsidies for farmers who are suffering a deprivation of rain of a one in 20 magnitude over the previous nine months. The announcement also included some assistance for small business in drought-affected areas.I am pleased to report to the House that farm industry and other organisations have enthusiastically embraced these new measures. The National Farmers Federation commended the government on this particular initiative as an appropriate response to one of the worst droughts on record. I was pleased to note the support, too, from the Australian Local Government Association and the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, who have particularly acknowledged the fact that, for the first time in a drought, assistance will be available for adversely affected small business. Even the New South Wales Farmers Federation was able to say some kind things - which we do not hear from them all that often - about this package. I did note that they were critical of the interest subsidies that we are providing only two weeks after they asked for precisely that kind of response from the government. So sometimes the responses that we are getting from these organisations are inconsistent.The member asked whether there were any alternative policies. I note in response to the package that the shadow minister for agriculture in the other place dusted off the Labor Party's six-point plan as their response to the needs of drought. Putting aside the fact that many of the announcements made were actually made two months after the government had put them in place and the other measures provide very little, this demonstrates how bankrupt the opposition is when it comes to providing real assistance to farmers. The farmers of Australia need to be aware of the fact that, under Labor's six-point plan, thousands of farmers would not have received any special assistance yesterday, they would not have received the interim assistance that we have been providing under exceptional circumstances arrangements, and most of them would not even get EC support for many months.The reality is that Labor in this House has just been an apologist for state governments who are not prepared to do anything to support the farmers in their states. If you think the farmers are doing well from state benefits, you should look at their own acknowledgments. The Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, in his last letter to me lodging another series of exceptional circumstances applications, admitted that his government had not provided any assistance at all to the farmers in that area. Yet, he was asking the federal government to provide exceptional circumstances assistance. The Queensland minister is now demanding that we add areas to this interim support - areas that he does not provide any support for. That is typical of Labor's approach to these sorts of issues. While the Commonwealth has provided over $1 billion in commitments to farmers and small businesses through this drought period, the combined efforts of the states total only $55 million - and that is only the promises. What they have actually delivered is infinitely less.This government is helping farmers in need. We know the problems they are facing are genuine and real. We are looking at ways in which we can ensure that our benefits flow quickly and with the minimum of paperwork. We want to ensure that assistance is provided in a timely way to help people through this difficult time so that we can again contribute towards building a much stronger rural Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question but I fail to see how three patrol boats can actually replace that of 15 and do it effectively. However, I argue against the allegations that the Navy is losing expertise or indeed capacity. As a matter of fact, I refute that totally. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I refute that because of the evidence. Right now, we have two of our naval vessels in the Gulf and they are doing an exceptional job. As a matter of fact, I could honestly say the Australian Navy is the mightiest little navy in the world. I say this for some very real reasons. It may be totally -  - I think for the member for Corio to suggest the comment that I just heard is an absolute disgrace. -  - The member for Corio referred to our Navy as `McHale's Navy'. -  - The fact is, since our Navy has been involved in the multinational coalition force against terrorism in the Gulf, the Australian Navy has been punching a lot higher than its weight. It may be unknown to the members on the other side that the Australian Navy has been sharing command with the United States Navy on a rotational basis. - No. The allegation that our Navy is somehow lacking capacity is a real concern to me. We have over 1,000 -  -  - The men and women of the Australian Navy are the pride of the nation. They have the full support of our government, and the other side should be absolutely ashamed of questioning their capacity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. Even though the rains have been coming down today, quite clearly we are still in the midst of a drought and will be for a long time. We are seeing some very practical assistance as part of the government's $368 million worth of resources - a very comprehensive package. This is a practical measure for people who have good skills and have been working on farms but have unfortunately been put off. Just to bring the magnitude of this to the attention of the House: some 20,000 jobs have been lost, predominantly in the rural sector, in central, western and northern New South Wales alone over the last 12 months. By using the Work for the Dole initiative through Drought Force, the government is trying to ensure that the people with those skills remain in the towns so that we do not see the towns denuded of their presence and that of their families, leading to schoolteachers leaving and further economic deterioration in those towns as small businesses are impacted.Most of us can but wonder at the challenges facing many in our rural sector - husbands and wives on their own just trying to keep cattle alive. Whilst mateship is alive and well in Australia, people from the land who unfortunately find themselves out of work at the moment will be given the opportunity to remain on the land, to go back and work on these properties doing valuable work which will help both the environment and the economy up there, and retain those much needed skills. On top of that, this initiative will provide a training credit of $800 immediately when someone volunteers. I point out to the House that this is a totally voluntary program. It means that people with the skills will be assessed and, if they are capable, they will be able to go and work with local councils, with farming organisations or on private property, doing things such as mending fences, fixing irrigation systems et cetera so that when the rains do come Australians will be able to benefit from the productivity that the rural sector provides. I have no doubt that those people in regional and rural Australia who, unfortunately, are unemployed at this time will pitch in and lend a hand to the rural sector by providing extra activities on the farms, giving a bit of a helping hand to the poor bloke out there who is having trouble feeding his own family. It is that sort of mateship that Australians have relied on in times of adversity. By using the Work for the Dole program to underpin this, through our community work coordinators, I am sure that this will be a very important element of the government's overall comprehensive package to assist our drought stricken farmers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I notice the opposition is today feigning an interest in border protection, yet yesterday it was about sabotaging border protection arrangements. The fact of the matter is that excision of places such as Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Ashmore Reef impacts only upon those people who seek to enter Australia without authority - that is, illegally. It has no adverse impact on Australians. It in no way derogates from our sovereignty. In fact, there are very positive reasons why excision has worked.We now know that people are looking at trying to come to Australia by other means or other routes. They are looking at alternative possibilities, including travelling into the Pacific. We know now that those sorts of prospects have been spoken of by the smugglers. We know that the Pacific solution is one way that we can deal with those issues effectively if boats are coming to or likely to sink near excised islands. We know that, if people are able to access Australia rather than Christmas Island, where they would be processed under the Pacific solution, it means longer processing times and more costly appeals. It also means that we cannot use the arrangements that we have put in place where we use the same processing arrangements that the UNHCR uses, which have far more rigour associated with them.It is particularly interesting that, following the launch of their policy, the Labor Party no longer claim that excision in some way derogates from Australia's sovereignty. They have acknowledged that excision is appropriate for Christmas Island, yet they argue that excising other islands which might be used or inadvertently used in a way which undermines our policy is inappropriate and is in some way a derogation of our sovereignty. What we have here, very clearly, is the opposition again trying to walk both sides of the street. Labor are out there saying, `Our policies are about being tough on border protection,' but, when it comes to implementing the range of measures that are necessary for effective protection, Labor want to walk away from it. You only need to see the speeches by my colleague the honourable member for Batman to Rural Australians for Refugees to see how Labor is walking both sides of the street. Labor highlighted one aspect of the policy and then came into this place and said that it is interested in border protection. I have a very clear warning for the opposition: our measures have worked well but, if people go out there signalling to smugglers that Australia is now back in business - and that is what Labor is about - I can tell you who will have to wear the situation. If any boats trying to transit the Torres Strait are brought to the Australian mainland, I will not let you forget that, when the government wanted those measures, you walked away from them. You will not have the opportunity to avoid this issue. We will give you a chance to consider it again, because we will bring this legislation back again and again until we get it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for the question. The first answer is, no, I was not aware. Secondly, if it is true - and I am not in a position to confirm or deny it - it is an operational matter for the commissioner to determine. It is not a matter for political interference in relation to the operation of the police force. I will make inquiries of the Minister for Justice and Customs. If there is anything further to add, I will come back.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I can assure the member for Gilmore that this government takes workplace safety issues very seriously indeed. Since 1996, there has been a 25 per cent reduction in workplace fatalities. Recently, the Commonwealth and the states agreed on specific targets for further reductions in workplace deaths and injuries because one workplace death is one too many.I should also point out to the House that unions do have an important role to promote workplace safety, but they should not be given a monopoly and they should not be given a privileged position in the occupational health and safety system. I regret to say that there are some unions which have used bogus safety issues to protect overmanning and to pursue extortionate wage claims. The CFMEU, for instance, has required the presence of safety supervisors for workers cleaning mirrors. It has required special labourers to supervise workers laying carpets. The CFMEU closed down the Murrin Murrin mine site because it alleged there were maggots in the canteen, even though workers had caught union activists red-handed contaminating the food supplies at that mine.Despite the CFMEU's frequent abuse of safety issues, I regret to inform the House that the New South Wales government currently has legislation before the parliament to give the CFMEU a statutory monopoly over the appointment of safety inspectors in the coalmining industry. Accepting that the New South Wales government would not want to put safety at risk, I respectfully ask the New South Wales government to reconsider whether giving a monopoly to this union above all unions is really going to improve safety in the mining industry. While I am on this topic, I also ask members opposite to consider how the union link consistently leads to poor policy outcomes as well as to the political problems that the Labor Party now faces. No less a person than the great Gough Whitlam lamented on the weekend saying, `I wouldn't get preselection these days -  - Mr Speaker, perhaps I could clear up the matter by pointing out that Chopper Read had no ears - and I have at least got plenty of ears.</DOC>

 - The first point I would like to make is that terrorism is the enemy of tourism. - You think it is funny? The member for Hotham thinks it is funny. - Any threats to national security will have a direct impact on the Australian tourism industry, as an export - and now, I understand, tourism is our number one export - as the fourth largest industry in Australia and as an industry that employs more than half a million Australians. Other than that, it is not for me to speculate on budgetary measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I notice that he has been out in the media, of course, because he loves the media.  - The member for Fraser interjects. You must hate the media, because we never hear of you. You are the shadow Treasurer. You should be up there: `My profile on the economy -  - My answer to the honourable member's question is that, following an examination of the Blick report on the question of whether the government had any information relating to an attack in Bali prior to the Bali bombing on 12 October, I think the Blick report is perfectly clear. As the Prime Minister and I in particular have said, both in this House and elsewhere, the government did not have any information that was not reflected in travel advisories. What we did not know could not be reflected in travel advisories and, therefore, the Bali attack was not reflected in the travel advisories. Were the travel advisories adequate on the basis of the information we had available to us? The answer to that is clearly that they were. From a period going back before 11 September 2001, going back, for example, to October 2000, the travel advisories put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade alerted visitors to Indonesia, for example, to the risks and dangers there. I do not have the information with me, but I can recall off the top of my head that information made available to the United States in the last quarter of last year about possible threats to Americans in Indonesia and more broadly in South-East Asia, if my recollection serves me well, was reflected not only in American travel advisories but in ours. I have made this point, despite what the member for the Griffith has been saying up in the press gallery with a few of his mates. - If the honourable member were interested in the issue rather than in making a relatively puerile party political point, he would know that on the serious point of the travel advisories - none of which I suspect the member has ever read - we have done a careful comparison between the three types of travel advisory that were issued by our own Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the period immediately before 12 October. We have compared those travel advisories with the travel advisories issued by the United States and the United Kingdom in a similar period. I tabled the Australian travel advisories, but, more to the point, I tabled the travel advisories of the United States and the United Kingdom in this parliament for members to read. - Having tabled those travel advisories, I make two points about them. In the first place, the Australian, American and British travel advisories were not identical but extremely similar. Allegations that have sometimes been made that somehow Australia's travel advisories were much more downgraded than American and British travel advisories are not correct, as I explained to the House back in October when this issue was very much at the forefront of people's minds. The second point I would make is that since the week after the Bali bombing, not only have the opposition had intelligence briefings but they have had available to them all these travel advisories. At no period have they called for an inquiry into the travel advisories.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the genuine and sincere question that she has asked. As the Prime Minister and I told the House, and have stated publicly on several occasions, clearly the safety of Australians is our highest priority, both in Australia and overseas. As the holiday period approaches, it is important that Australians planning overseas travel should not be complacent about travel advisories. Sadly, the international environment is not as safe today as it has been in the past. The attacks in Bali and other terrorist incidents in our region and around the globe underscore the risk to travellers.As far back as August 2001, my department warned Australians of the heightened risk of terrorism in our region and beyond. Even prior to this, in Jakarta we advised Australians of the threat of bomb explosions. We said then that Australians should be aware of the risks when they undertake travel. Obviously, that is all the more so now. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issues advice for 125 different countries. These advisories contain information about local conditions, including threats to security and personal safety. Where the government is aware of specific threats to Australians, these will be reflected in a strong travel advice warning. For example, and it is significant to look at an example, we continue to advise Australians to defer non-essential travel to Indonesia, including Bali, in recognition that threats against Australians and Australian interests in Indonesia remain high, given possible terrorist action and civil disorder. Australians in Indonesia should continue to exercise extreme caution in commercial and public places frequented by foreigners, and those concerned about their security should consider departure. Overnight our embassy in Jakarta issued a reminder to Australians in Indonesia to be aware of these warnings. Obviously, given the large number of Australians who travel overseas, it is particularly important that the government does its very best to warn those Australians of any particular dangers or difficulties they may confront - remembering that last year Australians made 3½ million trips overseas. In an effort to ensure that important travel advice reaches the widest possible audience, we continue to work with the travel industry and the media to further widen the dissemination of travel advice. Hits on my department's web site have increased 250 per cent over the last year which, I suppose, in the circumstances is hardly surprising, and it is certainly very welcome. Finally, Australians who are contemplating travel overseas should consult the web site or, of course, they are welcome to telephone the department to get any information in relation to risks and dangers that they could confront when they travel overseas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can advise her, and I can advise members of the House, that in the year 2000 this government introduced the largest cuts in personal income tax in Australian history and cut personal income tax by $12 billion. Just to put that in context, if all this government had done when it came to office was index tax brackets by the consumer price index, people would be paying more tax today than they are because the income tax cuts introduced by this government were greater than all of the so-called `bracket creep' from 1996 to 2002. In fact, you are actually paying $500 less than if there had been full indexation over the whole course of this government. - I am so pleased that the member for Kingston interjects, because my eye was taken to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald today from none other than the member for Kingston himself on the topic of tax cuts. I think the essence of his argument was that somehow the government's budget position was being unfairly or wrongly propped up by income tax rates. I regret to inform the House that the fundamental premise of this article is false. Let me quote:The headline cash balance appears to grow to a healthy surplus of $9.5 billion in 2004-05 and $9.7 billion in 2005-06.Wrong. As the MYEFO proves - and we have not had a question about the MYEFO in this House since it was released - on page 19, the headline cash balance in 2004-05 is $14.5 billion and in 2005-06 is $16.9 billion. So first of all you understate a figure by $5 billion in order to make a false claim. It reminds one of previous offences - previous offences in the Willis office in 1996.We then have, in the Sydney Morning Herald, this complaint that the top marginal income tax rate, which after the tax cuts was put up to 142 per cent of earnings, now cuts in at 129 per cent of earnings. That is his second big complaint. Can I inform the House that the reason why it cuts in at that level is that the Labor Party opposed our increase. The government bill was to push out the top marginal tax threshold to $75,000, and the Labor Party opposed it. We now have the member for Kingston running around and saying what a terrible government it was. It was overcome by the Labor Party veto in the Senate.The third thing we ought to take into account in relation to that is that not only did the Labor Party oppose the government's tax plan, which was to kick that out to 229 per cent, but the Labor Party opposed this government's income tax cuts generally. Let me read from the second reading debate and the amendment by the member for Hotham in relation to this government's personal income tax cuts. He said:I move:	...	...	...'the House requests that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to produce a fairer tax system with no GST, and in particular to overcome the following deficiencies - listen to this -  the fiscal profligacy of the Government's planned personal tax cuts ... The Labor Party sought to condemn the government for `fiscal profligacy' because its personal income tax cuts were so great, and the member for Kingston now wants to write articles complaining that they are not great enough. He himself said in relation to that matter that they were too great. I think he called them `unjustified' or some such word.The third point I want to make about the member for Kingston and his ingenuous article in the Sydney Morning Herald -  - Ingenuous is the word. You should know how to be careful with language: you have used it on the member for Hotham. - After reading this article based on false budget figures complaining that our tax cuts were not great enough when he himself opposed them for fiscal profligacy, you might actually get some idea that he was in favour of tax indexation of scales. I am sure that was a little suggestion that the member for Kingston was trying to put out there. He shakes his head now. He is not in favour of indexing tax brackets. - He shakes his head now, Mr Speaker. It was an apposite day. You might be able to fool the Sydney Morning Herald but down at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition was asked this question by Michael Harvey:Will you or would the Labor government consider indexing the tax scales to inflation?Bear in mind that this article today is a criticism of the government on tax indexation. The same day that he is writing that article, the Leader of the Opposition is asked whether he would consider indexing tax scales to inflation. - They always object at the critical moment, Mr Speaker. - The Sydney Morning Herald article was based on false figures. Secondly, there was criticism that the tax threshold cuts in too low when he opposed it being reduced to that level and stopped it being reduced further and a suggestion that somehow the Australian Labor Party may be in favour of indexing tax scales. On the very same day that he writes this article, this question is asked by Michael Harvey to the Leader of the Opposition:... will you or would the Labor Government consider indexing the tax scales to inflation?CREAN: 	The answer to the last part of the question is no, we won't be indexing. Those who want to argue it, of course they can argue it, but I don't support the straight indexation.In other words, `We'll have old Coxie out there arguing it, but it's not the Australian Labor Party policy.' It is not the Australian Labor Party policy because the Australian Labor Party never implemented it in 13 years of government; it is not the Australian Labor Party policy because the Australian Labor Party opposed the personal income tax cuts that this government put in place; and it is not the Australian Labor Party policy because the Australian Labor Party is, at this moment, opposing the government's expenditure reduction measures in a forlorn attempt to increase Commonwealth expenditures, and it has no inclination whatsoever to contain them. This is nothing but one of those ambiguous, self-contradictory, `walk both sides of the street' positions of the Australian Labor Party which have got it into so much policy pain.</DOC>

 - The member for Werriwa has made a number of assertions. I do not accept those assertions. I have had the opportunity to do but one thing, and that is to examine the document that was tabled. It does not describe Andrew and Helen Rogers as joint developers; it describes them as clients of the party who lodged the application, and it does not -  - The basis of the assertion that Senator Coonan had no beneficial interest in the Pittwater property is the absence of any reference to Helen Coonan on the title of the property and the absence of any evidence to me or to this parliament - and, to my knowledge, to anybody else - of some equitable arrangement or understanding which conferred a benefit on her. Whilst the member for Werriwa may be excited about this particular document, all I can say to the House at this stage is that, as always, if it is appropriate for me to provide any additional information to the House then I will. All I can say is that the excitement of the member for Werriwa may well be premature. The plan refers to Andrew and Helen Rogers as the clients. It is not uncommon, according to my understanding, that it does not necessarily follow that people so described in an application enjoy equal beneficial ownership of the property or, indeed, of the improvements. - I know we have an enormous number of people experienced in the building industry on the other side, but there are a few people on this side of the House who know. I would counsel the member for Werriwa not to engage in premature excitement on this particular subject. I would advise him not to do that. I stand by the observation that I have made before: on the information as communicated to me, the senator does not have a beneficial interest in the Pittwater property. That remains the information as communicated to me, and the attempt therefore to allege that she has avoided tax lacks substance. Perhaps if the member for Werriwa had spent a little more time trying to understand how these things really work rather than simply counting numbers in Labor Party branches, he would appreciate that if you are named as a client on the covering document of a plan lodged with a local council then it does not automatically follow that you have a beneficial interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and acknowledge her keen interest in these matters. Indeed, I attended a forum in her electorate some little time ago, and quite a number of constituents from her electorate were there to talk about health and ageing issues. Yesterday at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition outlined his policies on the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. He said:If that means we -  namely, the ALP - have to look again at the Private Health Insurance Rebate - with all its inefficiencies and rorts - we won't be afraid to do it.We know that the Labor Party has the private health insurance rebate under review. Part of the review is being conducted by the deputy leader of the Labor Party, the member for Jagajaga, who once described the rebate as:... the worst example of public policy ever seen in this parliament.There are two important consequences of what the Labor Party is talking about in relation to this. No member should forget the fact that, for the 8.7 million Australians with private health insurance, what the Labor Party is proposing to do in terms of abolishing the 30 per cent rebate is to increase the tax on those people, to slug families in Australia by between an extra $600 and $1,200 per year - a major slug. In the case of the member for Petrie's electorate, this would affect some 25,000 constituents and, of course, all of their children and families as well.In addition to a tax slug on ordinary Australians, there are some real health benefits which would be put in jeopardy by taking away this rebate. Only recently we saw, for the first time in the history of Medicare, the number of public hospital admissions in Australia fall by almost 5,000, yet, at the same time, the number of private health admissions grow by 245,000. So what the Labor Party is doing, in addition to slugging ordinary families between $600 and $1,200 a year, is saying that it will add almost a quarter of a million people to the public hospital queues in Australia. This would exacerbate the situation we have, where states and territories in Australia have reduced public hospital beds by 14,000 over the last decade. How would this affect ordinary Australians, those people who have procedures now performed in private hospitals? For example, 50 per cent of chemotherapy is now performed in private hospitals. Of major procedures for breast cancer, 53 per cent are performed in private hospitals, as are 56 per cent of cardiac valve procedures and 60 per cent - six out of 10 - of major joint replacement and limb reattachment procedures. These are the procedures, these are the health measures which the Labor opposition wants to put in jeopardy by its change to the rebate.Yesterday, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition was also making some vague, ambiguous offering about tax cuts in the same speech. So we again have the Labor Party trying to walk both sides of the road, at one stage suggesting some vague promise of a tax cut in the future, yet at the same time saying that it will take away the 30 per cent rebate - which, in effect, will be a tax slug to ordinary Australians, to 44 per cent of the population, including a million Australians on less than $20,000 a year. The ALP is ending this year as it started: without any comprehensive policy. I note, however, that some in the opposition actually understand this. I understand that the Chief Opposition Whip has recently been circulating a reminder to members of the ALP to attend an end of year party. This party is appropriately entitled `The ALP end of year meltdown'. This is the ALP's version of Three Mile Island. Someone should have told the member for Fremantle that last week was a bit premature for the meltdown. We have had the member for Grayndler running around like a free radical ever since, we have got the member for Rankin and the member for Lilley supplying the fissile material and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has been reduced to 50 per cent. Just one serious question on this: surely it is a whole of year meltdown?</DOC>

 - That question asks for a legal opinion, and I have no intention of giving a legal opinion without -  - I understand my limitations - I certainly do - and one thing I understood very early in this place is that, when you come to the dispatch box, you should bear two things in mind: you have an obligation of candour, and you have an obligation to understand your own limitations. Whilst those constraints might not be appealing to those who sit opposite, it certainly applies to me. First of all, I do not intend to give a legal opinion. Secondly, the assumption on which the question is based is joint ownership of the property. That is the assumption on which the question is based. On the information available to me, the assumption has not been verified or supported. The fact that an architect or builder lodges an application and describes people in a particular way -  - does not of itself mean that that information is accurate. -  - It does not mean that it is accurate. One of the things that I just happened to notice, which is certainly not conclusive but is certainly of passing interest, is that the minister is described as `Helen Rogers'. Although she is married to Andrew Rogers, to the best of my knowledge - and I have known Helen and many of my colleagues have known her for a lengthy period of time - I do not think she has ever used her second husband's surname. She has been known, both socially and professionally, as Helen Coonan. It could well be - and I am not asserting this - that the builder or the architect who lodged this application -  - made absolutely no inquiry as to the ownership situation -  - In the end, in time, this can be established. Members of the opposition can allege these things but, in order to establish your case, you have to demonstrate that, at law, Helen Coonan has a beneficial interest in the property. Now, you have not done that. You can only demonstrate that at law if you can produce a title deed which shows an interest on Helen Coonan's part or if you can produce some kind of agreement between Helen and her husband which manifests a beneficial interest in the property. There is, on the public record, a denial by Andrew Rogers of any beneficial interest other than his own. You have the denial of the senator.It would have been very simple for the member for Werriwa or the member for Lilley to have searched the title deeds and found out whether the names Coonan and Rogers appeared on the title deed, but they have not done that. Maybe they have. I would be surprised if they have not done that. That would have been very easy to do. I simply say to those opposite: if you are alleging a beneficial interest, prove it. I invite the members of the opposition to prove it. If you can prove it then obviously that will make a difference to the situation. It will mean that the information that I have been given and the information that I have communicated to the House at question time has been wrong. If it is, I am prepared to acknowledge that. I have acted, in everything that I have said in relation to this matter, on the information that I have been given and to the best of my knowledge and belief. - Let me sum up again in relation to the property at Clareville. It is my understanding - based on what I have been told by Senator Coonan and what I have been told, through my office, by her husband, Andrew Rogers - that the Clareville property is owned by Andrew Rogers and that his wife does not have a beneficial interest in it. I have not been provided with any evidence to countermand that. I have certainly not been provided with any evidence of the title deeds suggesting that that is wrong. It is self-evidently consistent with the way people arrange their affairs that, if two people with professional careers have second marriages, they would keep their assets and interests separate. So, on the face of it, those arrangements are consistent with what people would be expected to do in that circumstance. There is no evidence in relation to the title deed. The only possible evidence is the production of this development application, or part of it, by the member for Werriwa. It is a document that contains the description applied by the developer or by the architect. That does not automatically mean that that information is correct; all it means is that that is what the applicant put on this document. I suggest to the House that if the member for Werriwa, the member for Lilley or the Leader of the Opposition had more cogent evidence then we would have heard it by now. I will have some further inquiries made. I will get some further advice on this and I will bring that back to the parliament. Then I will invite the member for Lilley, the member for Werriwa and the Leader of the Opposition to apologise to the senator for slurring her character.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I was surprised, in a sense, at the question because, in view of the amount of lobbying of me that he has been doing on the issue of East Timorese asylum seekers, I thought he might try something else. Can I just say, in relation particularly to alternative detention arrangements for women and children, that I tabled last week a series of instructions that I have given in relation to unaccompanied minors, women and children, and those who require special needs to be addressed. Obviously, I am very keen to pursue those matters. If the opposition want to try to help in relation to those questions, they might try and assist with the South Australian Labor government, which keeps on saying to me, in relation to these issues, that there needs to be elaborate consultation at a local level in relation to when we might be able to implement it at Baxter.I think the Labor Party is in a position to be able to play a constructive role in relation to that if they wish, instead of having the Premier of South Australia writing to me saying that everything is hostage to consultations. Let me just make it clear that there is a difference between the government and the opposition in relation to these matters. The opposition believes that if you are going to release women and children, you have to also release any adult male partner. - Well, that is the view that the opposition has come to. - Once that happens, there is a very substantial issue. They are saying that people should be released subject only to health and security clearances, and we already know what they have in mind in relation to security clearances - you do not even have to know who they are before you are involved in security checking. But they are also talking about hostels. It interested me to see what they had in mind because the way in which they seem to be addressing this matter is to suggest that the detainees themselves ought to manage the environment in which they are held. The opposition is arguing for self-managed hostels - managed by the asylum seekers themselves. Let me give you a few examples of that sort of approach. In the United States of America, people in those sorts of circumstances do not remain available. Forty-two per cent of aliens in the United States of America who claimed a credible fear and were released failed to appear at their immigration hearings. In Ireland, 2,500 asylum seekers were reported as evading deportation orders. In Switzerland, 60 per cent of failed asylum seekers simply disappear. In Norway, the number of asylum seekers who have disappeared from their refugee reception centres this year is of the order of 3,600 - an 85 per cent increase over the previous year.If you were to pursue the sort of approach that the opposition is advocating, you can see clearly what would happen from the experience elsewhere. The part of Labor policy that particularly concerned me was the part that provided for a return to high security detention of those people who failed to abide by the rules. Then I read the document to find out what it said of high security detention facilities. The document said:High security detention facilities will be based on the alternative detention trial at Woomera.If members are interested, I will show them a photo of the high security facility at Woomera. Mr Speaker, I also have a copy for the Leader of the Opposition if he is interested. I am more than happy to table it for the benefit of all members. - I also have a copy for you, if you wish. - If you want to get a very clear indication of high security detention facilities -  - Mr Speaker, I would not want to intend any offence, particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, but let me just say that it is interesting that the Labor Party is developing proposals that talk of high security detention facilities based upon the alternative detention trial at Woomera when it is quite clear that, if you put people into a residential community with neighbours, it cannot be adequately secured. The only point I would make is that, if you intend to go down this route, it is probably also important to know what it is likely to cost. The preliminary costings on this part of Labor's initiative, based upon detention numbers as at 1 July 2000, are in the region of $90 million. I have used July 2000 because I cannot see how Labor's policy will do anything other than to send a signal to people abroad, which will increase the numbers coming to Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question about this very important matter. As I have said in this place, the government have already substantially tightened Australia's aviation security arrangements. We have introduced tighter passenger and carry-on baggage screening. We have extended it to more regional airports and more internationally checked baggage is being screened than ever before - up to 100 per cent on certain specified international flights. Over 150 additional protective service officers have been deployed at 11 airports throughout Australia, and air security officers have been flying on some thousands of flights since the end of last year.It is now prudent to move ahead in view of the international climate. After extensive consultation with the aviation industry in the context of that changing climate I have announced today at the National Press Club a number of measures. The government will require all airports that handle scheduled jet operations to screen all passengers and their carry-on baggage, including those flying on propeller services. As a result, the number of airports where security screening is required will certainly increase. In addition, we will introduce screening for passengers and carry-on baggage at additional airports where an airport operator or airline requests that security standards should apply. The airport operator or airline, we would envisage, would cover the cost of the screening facilities.We have heard some suggestions that screening should be extended to all 150 airports that handle scheduled services, including ones that handle a very small number of flights. I want to make it plain that, based on the best advice from our risk assessment agencies, the smallest of those, some of which carry only minimum numbers of flights, do not warrant such extensive screening programs. But all categorised airports - all 37 of them across Australia - which already have to have security plans in place, will be upgraded. We will be requiring upgrades to the capability of all passenger screening points. Upgraded equipment will see the use of cutting-edge technology - it does continually improve around the world - including some Australian technology. We will be right at the forefront with the equipment that we will be looking to have installed.I have touched on the fact that Australia has been screening checked baggage on a significant number of international flights for a while. It is now appropriate, though, to move to 100 per cent checked bag screening for all international flights. My department will be working with the industry to bring that into effect by the end of December 2004, which is a full year ahead of the deadline imposed by ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation. We will also be requiring the operators of Australia's major domestic terminals to introduce checked bag screening for domestic services on the same timetable - that is to say, the end of 2004. It cannot be done immediately, but it will be done as quickly as is possible, as the extensive modifications that will be required at many airports will allow and as the technology is able to be purchased, because there is tremendous demand for some of this more sophisticated technology around the world. These extensive measures will cost around $180 million over the next two years. The cost will be borne largely by the aviation industry, who are responsible for installing the equipment and providing security screening in accordance with the government's requirements, although we will cover, for example, the $4½ million or so cost of upgrading security at Christmas and Cocos islands. I emphasise that there will not be a government levy on the tourism industry, whose future depends of course on air travel remaining secure and travellers feeling confident in that security.The final but very important point I want to make in the context of this country being able to draw great succour from the capacity of its security agencies and those who form risk assessments is that we will keep our aviation security regime - as, indeed, we have been doing since September 11 in particular - under continuous review. We will be upgrading. We do have a capacity - we have used it in the past and we will in the future - to respond very quickly to a change in the level of alert.  - I want to assure the travelling public in Australia that we will not hesitate, wherever necessary, to respond to risk assessments as they are put to us by the relevant experts.</DOC>

 - I have, from time to time, read of people who avoid land tax. How widespread it is in New South Wales compared with other parts of Australia I do not know. I do not know that so I cannot say whether I am aware of it being so widespread in New South Wales or anywhere else. But can I say to the member that the fact base on which his claim is made in his question is wrong. You have not established that. The fact base in that question was as substantial as the fact base in the Sydney Morning Herald article. You are making the claim under privilege which you do not have the courage to do outside this parliament. I invite those who claim that Senator Coonan is a tax avoider to go outside and say it. - I invite him to go outside and say it, Mr Speaker. - The fact base on which the question is asked has not been established. You would have a valid argument, the member for Swan would have a valid argument, if you could establish the fact base - and you have not done that. It is clearly the case that Senator Coonan and her husband have separate assets and it is not an uncommon situation for two professional people on second marriages to keep their assets and their affairs completely separate. Nothing from the opposition, in all this fervid activity, has shaken that proposition. The Clareville property, on my advice, for relevant purposes has always been owned by Andrew Rogers. The Woollahra property has been owned by Senator Coonan. Andrew Rogers has dealt with the question of land tax liabilities. He has in fact paid, as I understand it, a significant amount of land tax on that property. My understanding is that he has paid a significant amount of land tax. There is no evidence of anything that has been avoided. There has been absolutely no evidence of that, but you come into this place and you make allegations under the cover of parliament privilege. It is very easy to do that.I wonder if the member for Kingston will be willing to repeat what he has just said outside. I wonder if he will be willing to do that. I doubt that he will. He does not get his Sydney Morning Herald articles right. On the information that I have been provided with - and I have no direct personal knowledge of these matters, obviously -  -  - How would I have direct personal knowledge of somebody else's business affairs? I am provided with information - as we all are in leadership positions - and, until that information is shaken by contrary information or by correction, I act in good faith in the belief that that information is correct. If you really had a knockout blow on this, like a title deed or some kind of evidence, you would produce it. But you have not and you are muckraking under parliamentary privilege.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. I can inform the member for Casey that the latest employment data confirms that this government has delivered to the Australian people higher pay for better work. In the two years to May average weekly full-time earnings went up by 7.1 per cent in nominal terms. Over the life of this government average weekly full-time earnings have gone up by more than 12 per cent in real terms. Over the life of this government basic award earnings have gone up by seven per cent in real terms. That compares with an actual drop of five per cent in basic award earnings during the life of the former government. - Thank you; I return the compliment, Prime Minister. Higher pay is a function of higher productivity, which in turn is a function of the spread of workplace agreements which have been encouraged by the policies of this government. A decade ago two-thirds of Australian workers had their pay and conditions determined by awards. The data released yesterday shows that 79 per cent - almost four-fifths - of the work force have their pay and conditions determined by agreements, not by awards. The data also shows that 42 per cent of Australian workers are now on individual contracts, and that includes nearly 300,000 Australian workers on Australian workplace agreements. I have to confess that it is not all good news. I am afraid that the gender pay gap has slightly widened over the last two years. Some industries are still prone to pattern agreements, which are more prescriptive than awards. But, generally, freedom and flexibility are increasing features of the Australian workplace, thanks to the policies of a government that believes that workers and managers can be trusted to run their own lives and know their own interests. By contrast, the opposition believes that all bosses are vicious and all workers are weak, and is constantly trying to find new victims to justify new restrictions on the freedom of the Australian people. But the opposition is suffering from a bad case of TDS: truth deficit syndrome. First of all, we had the Leader of the Opposition telling a press conference last week that every shadow cabinet minister supported the boat people policy, just a few moments before Carmen Lawrence resigned. Then we had the Leader of the Opposition telling the Press Club yesterday that not a single shadow minister agrees with Carmen Lawrence, when we know that the member for Grayndler was applauding her in public. The hearse driver over there, the member for Grayndler, was applauding her in public. We know he is driving the hearse; has he set the date for the funeral yet? - Let me point out to members opposite - and this is more good news from the Howard government - that the latest figures show that some 15 per cent of federally registered certified agreements are non-union agreements, compared with just five per cent in 1997. On the subject of truth deficit syndrome, if the member for Werriwa had gone immediately to the title deeds of that property in Paradise Avenue, he would know that Senator Coonan does not -  - figure on those title deeds. - He is repeatedly uttering barefaced lies. - I am happy to withdraw any offensive reflection on any member in this House.Opposition members - Withdraw it! Withdraw it! - I withdraw. I withdraw. I withdraw. - Yes, I have, Mr Speaker. I was asked, in the very good question from the member for Casey, if there was any alternative policy. The alternative policy from members opposite is grubby muckraking on the theory that a scandal a day keeps the policy away and, more importantly, a scandal a day keeps challengers at bay. That is their policy: a scandal a day keeps challengers at bay.  - If they have any serious allegations about Senator Coonan, they should make them. - </DOC>

 - I entirely repudiate any suggestion that the Prime Minister or I are acting to help the Prime Minister's mates - real or imagined. - If that is the essence of this rather tawdry and paltry attack then it deserves condemnation -  - It speaks a lot about the people who make those allegations. As it turns out, after hearing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on the radio this morning in relation to a story in the Sydney Morning Herald, I sought and obtained a copy of the report to Environment Australia - which I had not seen before - which is called A Literature Review Based Assessment on the Impacts of a 20% Ethanol Gasoline Fuel Blend on the Australian Vehicle Fleet, hoping this scientific report would resolve the matter as to what amount of ethanol was safe in a car. But unhappily it does not. It says in the executive summary:The impact of a 20% ethanol blend on engine and fuel system durability of the Australian vehicle fleet is unclear. In terms of engine wear the literature reviewed is vague, leaving the only valid conclusion that testing is required to obtain data to form a view.In its conclusions, it says:In many cases, there is incomplete, insufficient or conflicting information available, and hence vindicates the detailed testing program, which is to be undertaken as part of tender 34/2002, is warranted.I had not seen that report before. Hoping that this report may have resolved the issue, I sought and obtained a copy. The report reviews the literature and it confirms what I had previously understood to be the case - that the literature is inconclusive - and it calls for testing. That testing is being done by Environment Australia, as I have also indicated. When the minister has a recommendation to put to the cabinet then it will be considered by the cabinet and a decision will be made. It is not my place to put the recommendation to the cabinet; it is within the province of the Minister for the En-vironment and Heritage, who has been tasked through Environment Australia to look at these matters. I await his recom-men-dation, and the cabinet will make its decision accordingly. - I was quoting from it, and I table it. Can I indicate that it has been sent out to the industry, so it is not a secret document in any - He always gives us our best points! It has actually been publicly released, it has been sent out to the industry and I table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question, for his interest in the policy direction the government has taken in this regard and for his support of the government's policy direction of trying to pursue every avenue to open up opportunities across the world for Australia's exporters. Only a couple of weeks ago, during his visit to Australia, the United States trade representative Bob Zelick indicated to us that he was going to notify Congress of the Bush administration's intention to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. A free trade agreement between Australia and the United States is almost a once in a lifetime opportunity. Given the size of the United States economy and our interests there, Australia stands to gain in a wide range of sectors. An economic analysis that has been undertaken indicates gains of some $4 billion per year from opening up and lowering tariffs into that market. Services companies will stand to gain from closer economic integration, and a free trade agreement with America will play a major role in attracting further US investment in Australia.The United States is Australia's largest trading partner. The value of the two-way trade relationship between Australia and the United States now stands at $45 billion. Interestingly enough, on the investment front, the story is just as significant. Australia, with a population of 19.5 million, is the eighth largest investor in the United States. The United States is the largest investor in Australia. Why wouldn't any responsible government pursue better opportunities and a free trade agreement with the United States? We know the Australian Labor Party are opposed to this. We know the Australian Labor Party are opposed to providing greater opportunities for Australia's exporters and investors.The first round of negotiations should be starting in around March 2003 when a delegation from the US will be in Australia. The government have engaged two Washington based lobbying firms to help argue our case in Washington and to give us every opportunity for a successful and productive outcome. We have also called on the public for submissions from the private sector by 15 January 2003. We have undertaken significant research within government over the last couple of years in terms of the areas we want to address and what we want to pursue. We want to make sure we have not missed anything on behalf of the private sector. We will continue to draw heavily on the knowledge of Australian businesses that are experienced in the US market. Now is the time for business to work with government to ensure that those concerns are raised and that we do not miss any opportunities in these negotiations. Both the United States and Australia are committed to a comprehensive agreement, as is the requirement under the rules of the WTO.But, again, we all know that the Labor Party is opposed to all bilateral negotiations, particularly negotiations with the largest and strongest economy in the world. A comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States will deliver significant benefits to the Australian economy, something Labor opposes. A comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States will set a high standard for other free trade agreements around the world, again something the Labor Party opposes. A comprehensive free trade agreement will complement and invigorate the multilateral negotiations in the WTO in the Doha Round, again something the Labor Party opposes. But we are not surprised by the Labor Party's opposition to the policy direction the government has taken. In seven years, it has continually opposed every measure our government has put in place to benefit Australian businesses and Australian workers and the prospects for more jobs in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wills for his question. This report has not been sat upon or withheld by the government. It is a report which has recently been received, and as soon as I received it I made it public. It is publicly available. There has been absolutely no sitting on the report. The report is a literature review. It is the first stage of the scientific testing which the government has put in place to determine what an appropriate fuel standard for ethanol blends ought to be. The report clearly makes the point that there is a great deal of conflicting opinion and there is a paucity of information in relation to the impact of E20 blends. That is why the government has put the testing program in place. When the government receives results from the program, it will be able to make an informed decision.I would also like to make the point that the most disreputable feature of the Labor Party's attack on ethanol blends in petrol is that it is potentially eroding consumer confidence in these blends. Ethanol is a renewable fuel. Biofuels have a role to play in the production of Australian energy and Australian fuels. The government is committed to the support for biofuels, ethanol is a significant renewable biofuel and the effort of the Labor Party to discredit ethanol in the minds of consumers is potentially very damaging to what could be a fuel to support a significant Australian renewable energy industry.The final point I would make is that, to the extent that warranty issues are raised by E20 blends - and this is in the hands of the motor vehicle manufacturers themselves - the legal power to address these consumer issues and to ensure that consumers obtain appropriate information about the blends is in the hands of the state governments. The South Australian government has already put in place a regime. The Queensland government has put in place a regime. The issue of E20 blends has arisen solely in New South Wales. The Carr government has failed to exercise its legislative power to put in place appropriate regulation to secure consumer information. This power only exists at the state level. Two months ago I advised the New South Wales minister that this was a matter that the New South Wales government should address its attention to. It has not done so. It has taken no action throughout the eight years in which E20 blends have been available in New South Wales. If there are warranty issues being raised for consumers, the responsibility for ensuring that consumers receive appropriate information about ethanol blends rests with the Carr government in New South Wales. If the Labor Party feels so strongly about this, it should speak to its mates and ensure that consumers receive adequate information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question. Like a number of members on this side of the House, including me, she certainly knows from first-hand experience the devastating impact that drought has not only on farmers but also on the farming community. The Howard government has listened and responded to the difficulties faced by small businesses in drought affected areas that are struggling to cope with the effects of drought. This is an unprecedented federal government initiative - and I have been involved with a few federal government initiatives in my time; one which involved the member for Hotham and another which involved the member for Griffith. The package is without doubt far more expansive than any other drought package ever put in place by a federal government. In recognising the difficulty of small businesses that are going through a very difficult time but that have a solid future, we have put in place an interest relief subsidy scheme for those small businesses that can subsidise debts of up to $100,000. Small businesses in exceptional circumstance areas will qualify for this assistance where they have a significant fall in turnover. Applications will also be considered from businesses outside EC areas that can show a very strong linkage to customers within an EC area. Payments of up to 50 per cent of a small business's interest bill on a loan of up to $100,000 or five percentage points, whichever is less, will be available to those small businesses for a period of up to two years. There are criteria attached to this assistance. The business must have a turnover of at least $50,000 per annum and employ fewer than 20 employees, although there is some discretion with regard to that, depending on the circumstances of the business. There must be a demonstrable effect from the drought. That has to be indicated by a 50 per cent fall in the turnover of the business. Centrelink offices in EC declared areas will deliver the initiative. Businesses that require further information can contact the call centre in Toowoomba on 13 23 16. I should add that to date - and this was only launched on Monday - that call centre has taken in excess of a hundred calls. Application forms are available from Centrelink offices and from the web.This initiative is to provide hope to those people, including small businesses, who are out there struggling with the effects of the drought. While the federal government are doing more than any other government has ever done, the member for Farrer asked me what the state governments are doing, and the answer is: very little. While we have allocated almost $1 billion in drought assistance, the state governments combined have allocated less than $60 million and have actually granted $10 million. Ten million dollars is less than half what this government have given in my electorate alone.</DOC>

 - Even though my wife is British, let me say that it does not mean that everything the British say is always right. It does amuse me that, because Britain has a Labour government, the Labor Party believes that everything the British say is right. - Very curious. The forelock tugging does not do you proud. - I will make several points in answer to this question. Firstly, the British report the honourable member referred to was a British report to the British parliament by a committee of the British parliament. It related to threats to British interests, not threats to Australian interests. - Even you have worked that out, have you? It must be a simple point then. - Threats to Australian and British interests are not necessarily the same. Australia makes its own judgments based on Australian interests. - Do you ever listen? You just jabber all through question time. - As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, while we work from a similar pool of information, these conclusions are not directly comparable, because the British and Australian situations are, from time to time, different. The British threat assessment for general British interests in Indonesia at the time of the Bali attack was assessed to be the third highest - `significant' is the word they use - of their six-level system. They have a six-level system for threat assessment. In the case of the British, they were at the third level of their six levels. This is one of the criticisms made of the British Foreign Office or the British Public Service by the British parliamentary committee.I had a look to see what our threat assessment was. On 28 September 2001, the Australian threat assessment for Indonesia was increased to `high' for threats against Australian interests in Indonesia. This is the highest level in Australia's four-level system. The point I make here is that the British make judgments about British interests, not Australian interests. We do not make judgments about British interests, we make judgments about Australian interests. Britain had their threat assessment at the third level; we had our threat assessment at the highest level. So it is clear that our judgments, in particular our intelligence community's judgments, of the threat level against Australians was substantially higher than the judgments the British made. - I am talking about the threat assessments, not the travel advisories. They make judgments about threats to Britons, not threats to Australians. I am not making any critical comment of the British government. Secondly, in relation to the travel advisories, I said that the British travel advice for Indonesia was similar, but I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that I did not say it was the same. Even the Leader of the Opposition is able to work that out. I will explain the differences for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition: the British travel advice for Indonesia current at the time of the Bali attack was that most visits to Indonesia are trouble free. They had had that same travel advisory since 30 November 2001.Australia's travel advice for Indonesia had been kept under constant review throughout that period; indeed, it was reviewed and reissued seven times in 2002 before the Bali attack. That was not the case with the British. On 12 July 2002, our travel advisory was upgraded to include the following specific language:Bombs have been exploded periodically in Jakarta and elsewhere in the past, including areas frequented by tourists. Further explosions may be attempted.Then, on 10 September 2002, in response to credible threats concerning the region, the Indonesian travel advice was upgraded to include the following specific language:In view of the ongoing risk of terrorist activity, Australians should maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.It is worth noting that the government reissued the travel advice on 13 and 20 September 2002 without substantive changes in order to further highlight these risks.I think what the intelligence community did in assessing the risks to Australians was imperfect, because they did not identify the Bali attack - nor did any other intelligence service. To the best of our knowledge, no-one knew the Bali attack was going to happen, other than those who perpetrated the attack - and the Blick report has reinforced that. But on the basis of the information our officials had available to them - and I make that qualification: on the basis of the material they had available to them - I think the travel advisories were adequate.  - Mr Speaker, I seek leave of the House to table a copy of the report of the British parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee's report on the terrorist bombings as well as the British government's and the Australian government's travel advisories pre-Bali.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for the question. I can inform the House that, as of last night, all known Australian victims of the attack in Bali have now been identified. Eighty-eight Australians died as a result of this terrible tragedy. I am advised that, of these, 81 died in Bali, six died in Australia and one died in Singapore. Given the horrific nature of the explosion and the terrible injuries and disfigurement inflicted upon so many of the victims and the expectations at the time, it is truly remarkable that all of the victims have now been identified. It speaks volumes for the work of the forensic people, the doctors, the dentists and the officers of the Australian Federal Police as well as their colleagues in the medical profession and the police in Indonesia. When you have lost so much, the relative comfort of being able to identify your loved one is very important. The fact that all of these victims have been identified will be of immense comfort and reassurance to so many of our fellow Australians. I therefore take the opportunity of recording on behalf of all members of the House our gratitude to those Australians who worked so well to achieve this outcome. I am pleased to say that many of them are remaining in Indonesia to help identify the non-Australian victims of the atrocity who are yet to be identified. They will continue to work in conjunction with the Indonesian authorities to identify the remaining non-Australian victims.I also take the opportunity of congratulating the Indonesian police on the excellent progress that has been made so far in apprehending and bringing to justice those who, in the words of the foreign minister, knew when this terrible event was to occur. The cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police has been quite remarkable. I record the gratitude of Australians to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, and his officers, particularly Mr Graham Ashton, who has been the head of the police contingent in Bali, and through them to the men and women of the Australian Federal Police. It is a great tribute to their professionalism. The arrangement for that cooperation was put in place two days after 12 October as a result of the visit to Jakarta by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs. Had it not been for that arrangement being put in place so speedily, perhaps the outcome would have been different.In the wake of this awful tragedy that con-tinues to haunt our country and continues to leave so many people saddened, grief-strick-en and traumatised, we can see aspects of superb professionalism and individual courage. Given the very stressful conditions in which people worked in that makeshift morgue, I say again that I am filled with admiration for those forensic people. I met a number of them, as did the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister, when we went to Bali five days after 12 October. Their dedication and persistence in the most stressful of all circumstances is quite remarkable. We can but again express our compassion, warmth and affection for our fellow Australians who have lost so much in this disaster and, amidst that, record our admiration for the superb professionalism, camaraderie and cooperation, which are hallmarks of an Australian response to an attack upon Australians and an attack upon the interests of this country. </DOC>

 - I believe the answer to that is: certainly. The information in intelligence reports - I do not think this would be a secret to those on the other side of the House who have served in government - is passed between intelligence agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Where information is relevant to our consular interests - obviously, it is not always relevant to our consular interests - then, naturally enough, that is taken into account. I could think of scores of examples of where intelligence has been brought forward and, typically, the department - but sometimes even with me, as their minister - have sat around, looked at the intelligence and thought about what we should do with the travel advisory in the context of that intelligence. It is actually one of the very difficult judgments that departments and ministers - particularly, I think, in a way, the depart-ments, although ministers accept respon-sibility for these things - have to make, by reading the intelligence, making judgments about the credibility of the intelligence and then adjusting the travel advisories.I have actually been very interested in the discussion that has taken place in the country that the honourable member always quotes - Britain - about the terrorist attack in Mombasa. Since the honourable member has asked questions about our travel advisories -  - one of the the big issues that blew up in Britain in that particular case was that the Australian travel advisory for Kenya specifically mentioned the possibility of terrorist attacks in Mombasa and the British did not, yet we shared information. This is a good illustration of the point that information is, of course, shared. Different foreign ministries, in that case, made different judgments about the intelligence but, to be very specific, the intelligence - which was, by the way, collected not just by intelligence agencies - was passed to our intelligence agencies and, where it was relevant, was passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and taken into account in their travel advisories. But I do make this point: we have been appropriate - I was going to say `generous', but I think it has been the right thing to do, not just a generous thing to do - in ensuring that the opposition has had briefings on intelligence. The truth of this is that the opposition has a very good understanding of what was available in the intelligence area during 2002. - I am not too sure about earlier. If there are lacunae in the opposition's knowledge, then we would obviously be happy to provide further briefings, because we do not work on the basis -   - You cannot stop making past political points, can you, on grave issues -  - and I never advise that to politicians. I never advise that.  - Mr Speaker, I think there is a point beyond which party political points should not be made. -  - I know you do not know what that point is, but I could give you some advice on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I genuinely do thank him, because we do not get any questions at all on the state of the economy from the opposition. We still have not had one on the national accounts or the midyear review, so I thank the member for Fairfax for his question because it gives us the opportunity to review the Australian economy and to look at the prospects for next year. The international economy deteriorated throughout the course of 2002, and it now appears likely that growth in Australia's major trading partners in 2001-02 was the weakest two-year period in more than 30 years. In addition to that, the Australian economy is suffering a very severe drought, with agricultural production falling 12.2 per cent in the September quarter alone. Notwithstanding that, the Australian non-farm economy has continued very strongly, with business investment, household consumption and rising incomes. The Secretary-General of the OECD, in talking of the Australian economy today, said this:'Australia is one of the stars in the OECD galaxy,' he said. 'It's evident that Australia has been able to be very resilient and responsive to downturns in the economy ...'And even with the consequences of the drought this year, Australia will certainly be amongst the leaders.' The labour force figures were released today and, as I have said in the House on a number of occasions, they bounce around from month to month and we would be foolish to read too much into any monthly figures. But, notwithstanding a slight rise in the headline unemployment rate from six per cent to 6.1 per cent, the November figures showed strong employment growth. The overall rise in employment was due to a large increase in full-time employment, which for the month was up by 57,300 jobs. Again I say that it is foolish to read too much into one month's record but we can actually see that there were rises in employment in November and see that, notwithstanding the international economy and notwithstanding the drought, unemployment only rose to 6.1 per cent. There was strong jobs growth. These are the lowest unemployment rates - as we have said - since Labor's recession in the early 1990s.The OECD Secretary-General, Mr Johnston, also said that Australia should not rest on its laurels and should work on improving its unemployment rate. He suggested that labour market reform was still important. We would agree with that; labour market reform is still important. The point about these unemployment figures is that they could be lower than they are if Australia were able to engage in further labour market reform. And it is not because this government is resting on its laurels; this government is actively working on reforming Australia's labour markets. I pay tribute to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his predecessors, and to all the members of the coalition that want to give Australians the opportunity of jobs. What stands in the way of further labour market reform in this country? The Labor Party and the member for Hotham, who believe it is more important to pay their dues to the Australian trade union movement than to give people the opportunity of a job. The best thing that Labor could do in economic policy is get out of the way - allow our reforms to go through the Senate, enact the budget and give young Australians the opportunity of getting a job so that they have a better future. Whilst the Labor Party dithers, the coalition delivers. - Labour force figures from 1996, when the coalition was elected, to today show that there have been 1.1 million new jobs created in the Australian economy - there has been economic growth and job opportunities. The coalition delivers whilst the Labor Party dithers.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I do remember making that comment at the weekend. I was not addressing that remark to that lady; I was addressing the remark to what - through you, Mr Speaker - the Leader of the Opposition had said. The point I was making - and this question gives me an opportunity to make this point, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that opportunity - was that any suggestion that bulk-billing has disappeared or is disappearing, given the rates of bulk-billing in Australia at the present time -  - is factually incorrect. Indeed, the levels of bulk-billing at the present time are significantly higher than they were for substantial periods of time under the Hawke and Keating governments. That is a fact. -  - What concern did you have for a lady in that position when you were a minister in the Keating government? None. You had no concern then; none whatsoever. What the Labor Party are about in the area of health is slugging middle Australia with a tax hike of $2½ billion by taking away the health insurance rebate.  - That is what you are about. Your shadow health minister says that it is a public policy crime. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has never disavowed her hostility to private health insurance rebates. - The Leader of the Opposition is backing away from private health insurance tax support at 100 miles an hour. Labor have clearly said to middle Australia that if Labor form a government then, in terms of the private health insurance rebate - worth $2½ billion and which cuts by 30 per cent the cost of private health insurance premiums - every single Australian family which now gets a 30 per cent subsidy will face a tax hike of $2½ billion in aggregate. That is what will happen. There is all this obfuscation by the opposition about bulk-billing.I invite the Leader of the Opposition to go and have a look at what was said about bulk-billing when Medicare was introduced. I invite the opposition to go and have a look at what was said about bulk-billing by a Labor health minister in 1987. It was never part of the original Medicare or the Medicare as administered by Labor when it was in office that bulk-billing would be universally available. That was never their claim. It was never the claim of Dr Blewett, it was never the claim of Brian Howe and it was never the claim of other Labor health ministers. In fact, the levels of bulk-billing are now far ahead of what they were during many of Labor's 13 years in government. Year after year, their rates of bulk-billing were significantly lower than what they are at the moment.This is about trying to justify a tax slug on middle Australia. They are not interested in making services available to poor people in the Australian community; they are interested in slugging middle Australia with a tax hike of $2½ billion. - I seek leave to table the woman's letter that I quoted. She is one of the many thousands of Australians for whom bulk-billing has disappeared.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. The answer to the first part is that yes, my attention has been drawn to that. I read in the paper this morning that the Premier of Queensland had written to me. I have not seen the letter myself, but I am sure a copy of it was made available to the paper; and that is fine, because I was able to get in advance a bit of an idea of what the Premier was going to say to me. The Premier has asked for the Commonwealth to provide more money for drought relief in Queensland. It is a fairly familiar request and a fairly familiar mantra from a number of premiers at this particular time.The drought is having a severe effect on many parts of Australia. In response to that the Commonwealth in different ways has now committed over $1 billion to dealing with the drought, including the recent additional package of measures totalling $368 million over three years. I am particularly interested in the call from the Premier of Queensland to provide some more money. I have had some research done and I am informed that, to date, the states of Australia have committed a total of about $60 million for drought relief.Government members - What, $60 million from all of them? - Yes, $60 million from all of the states as against over $1 billion from the Commonwealth. It gets even more interesting when you analyse it on a state by state basis. In the case of Queensland, $6 million has been put into this year budget for drought relief. This is from the man who is saying to me, `Give us more money.' I say to him: `Why don't you give your Queensland electorate some more money. Premier Beattie, charity starts at home. Do something for Queenslanders instead of asking the Commonwealth, which has already been very supportive, to do even more.' While he has been given $6 million, the Commonwealth has already committed $20 million to the Darling Downs area of Queensland alone. So, for one area of Queensland, there is a commitment of $20 million from the Commonwealth, while for the whole of Queensland, only $6 million has been committed by the Queensland state government. Yet the Premier of Queensland has got the gall to write to me and say that the Commonwealth should be providing more money. For the whole state of Queensland, under all of our programs - and this does not include any notional distribution of the Farm Management Deposits scheme money - $100 million is going to be available from the Commonwealth help to Queenslanders against $6 million from the Queensland government. But he is not Robinson Crusoe. We go south of the border into eastern daylight saving time in New South Wales and what do we find? We find that the Premier of New South Wales has been pretty vocal - he is on the air almost every night saying, `The Commonwealth should give more,' but he has put in place what could only be called a very tiny package. He has put in $16 million, only 28 of the 48 rural lands protection boards get any money -  - Listen to this, Mr Speaker - the Leader of the Opposition interjects, `Wait so long.' He must have known what I was about to say, because farmers in New South Wales have got to wait six months following a drought declaration before they get anything of nothing. That is fundamentally the policy that operates in New South Wales. The Commonwealth, under our commitments, will be spending $350 million for farmers in New South Wales, against $16 million from the New South Wales government.Let us journey further south into the great state of Victoria. After a lot of fanfare, the Premier of Victoria has produced a package of $27 million. That's good? That is $21 million more than the Premier of Queensland produced, so he ought to get a real pat on the back. By comparison, we expect to spend over $100 million in the state of Victoria.Let us go across the Nullarbor. Let us go over to that great state of Western Australia, so well represented on this side of the House by some absolutely magnificent members. In Western Australia they announced a package for the whole of the state. You may well have thought it would be a big package - it is a very big state. But what did they announce? It was $6.8 million. But listen to this: to be eligible, a farmer in Western Australia cannot have received any Commonwealth interest subsidies. In other words, they give nothing and then they penalise people for receiving any Commonwealth largesse. I think they should almost be taken to the High Court for that. I think it is a breach of the principle of federalism. I think it is outrageous. Fancy picking on somebody because they got some Commonwealth money. What are we going to spend in Western Australia? We were spending $30 million.In South Australia - I do not want to leave South Australia out; the foreign minister will never speak to me again if I leave South Australia out - you have a package of $5 million announced by the South Australian government. You know what we are going to be committing to South Australia on current estimates? Three times that amount: $15 million. I conclude by saying that I have rarely seen, in the 6½ years I have been Prime Minister, a grosser example of the hypocrisy of state governments and a refusal by state governments to accept their responsibilities. The Commonwealth has been generous; the Commonwealth has done the right thing. We feel for the farmers of Australia, we care about the farmers of Australia and we are willing to put the dollars of the Australian people in the pockets of farmers who need that help.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England. Very significantly, as a result of the views put to me by the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party and by many Liberals and Nationals representing rural seats around Australia - and not least in New South Wales - we have a very firm view on this. This firm view is that we are putting the states on notice that that competition payment money has to be made available to help farmers who lose property rights when water entitlements are either eliminated or diminished. We hold to the principle that if people lose a property right they should be compensated. Property rights are conferred by the states under the Constitution; they are not conferred by the Commonwealth. We want two things in this area. We want the establishment of a regime all over Australia where a property water right granted in New South Wales is recognised and enforceable in the other parts of Australia, and vice versa. We also want to establish the principle that if you have your water entitlement diminished or eliminated you are entitled to compensation. It was always intended that those competition payments would, amongst other things, be available to assist the process of adjustment of water rights.It is also interesting, when you go back and examine the files, to remember that the competition payments arrangements were negotiated by a federal Labor government and a large number of state coalition governments. So it will be a bit hard for Labor to argue that there was something wrong with the science when these agreements were negotiated. You not only find what I have just said in relation to what this money should be available for, but you also find, very interestingly, that one of the reasons for the competition payments when they were thought of in 1995 was the absence of a growth tax in the hands of the states of Australia. The argument behind the competition payments was that, if you reformed your economy and made it more competitive, there would be greater economic activity, you would collect more revenue, and the states ought to be compensated because they did not have a growth tax. So, bit by bit -  - No, the additional revenue is going to the states via the GST, my friend. That is something that of course did not exist in 1995. So I want to assure not only the member who asked me the question but also my colleagues on this side of the House - and indeed all interested members - that we are going to press ahead on this issue. We are committed to water reform. We do believe the competition payments should be available for that. We will continue to argue that case and we will continue to push the cause of nationally acceptable and enforceable water rights. It is a matter of ordinary Australian justice for Australian farmers that if they lose their water rights they ought to get compensation. As far as I am concerned, the first cab off the rank for that compensation is those competition payments.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. He is a fine South Australian and does an excellent job for the people of Grey.  - I heard somebody say they all are; certainly, a lot of that is true. - Those are very cynical interjections. Next week I will be leading a delegation of eight Australian members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, representing all of the major political parties in the parliament, to the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and New Zealand. The delegation, honourable members might be interested to hear, not only includes me but also the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs - also a South Australian - the member for Hindmarsh, an excellent member. Other South Australians include Senator Alan Ferguson, the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. - Your great mate. - It is true: he is a friend of mine. There will also be the member for Bonython - the delegation does look rather South Australian; the member for Newcastle, so New South Wales is now part of the delegation; the members for Dawson and Curtin; and, representing the Australian Democrats, Senator Stott Despoja, who I note is also a South Australian.On a more serious note, I think it is important that not just the government but the parliament remain apprised of issues in the South Pacific. Sometimes, when a crisis erupts in the South Pacific, people and particularly commentators say that Australia has neglected the South Pacific. Usually, that reflects the fact that commentators themselves neglect the South Pacific. For all the issues going on at the moment -  - The honourable member for Melbourne interjects, asking whether I am talking about Greg Sheridan - no, but I would commend to you Greg Sheridan's article today, about the Leader of the Opposition, because I think there is a lot of truth in it. - My point is that we should concentrate on the South Pacific constantly, regardless of international issues elsewhere that we have to deal with and that the House is familiar with. We are deeply concerned about the situation in the Solomon Islands. Despite substantial efforts being made by this country, this government, and by New Zealand and others to try to improve the situation in the Solomon Islands, progress has been slow. There is still a long way to go to stabilise the Solomon Islands and get the government's authority asserted more effectively, through a stronger law and order situation. It is important that we have ongoing engagement in Vanuatu and do what we can to assist Vanuatu through what is a relatively difficult period. In the case of Samoa, one point I would make is that they have done an extraordinarily good job in the management of their economy. Through our aid program, we assist them in all sorts of different ways to keep building on their successes.There are big issues in the South Pacific for this country. As I once said in a speech in Suva some years ago, Australia ignores the Pacific at its peril. There may not be a lot of day-to-day interest in the South Pacific from commentators, but for the government it is a constant. It is a very significant issue for us. There are issues of concern in the region that we are doing our best to address - importantly, with New Zealand. At the end of this visit, I will be going to New Zealand for the six-monthly consultation with the New Zealand government and, in particular, my friend and counterpart Phil Goff. Although he is Labour, he certainly does not constantly make party political points; he can rise above that.We have an excellent relationship with the New Zealand government. Despite the difference in political complexion, we have worked together extraordinarily successfully on many South Pacific issues and, importantly, in East Timor. They have also been a great help to us in dealing with the problem of illegal migration and people-smuggling. Their assistance to Australia, particularly last year but also in the course of this year, is recognised and is very much appreciated by this government. This trip is a great opportunity not just for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also for the parliament to engage in maintaining Australia's profile in the South Pacific. I look forward to welcoming on the trip all those members of parliament who have been nominated to participate. </DOC>

 - I have examined this matter and, on the information provided to me, I do not believe that the minister has behaved improperly. Let me read a statement dated 11 December 2002. It is on the letterhead of Royal and SunAlliance and it reads as follows:In March 2001 Royal and SunAlliance received a claim from Senator Helen Coonan in respect of losses flowing from defective building work in respect of a residential property in Woollahra. The claim was handled in accordance with Royal and SunAlliance's usual procedures applying to any building warranty claim. It involved an independent assessment of the claim which was complex and rectification costs were estimated to be considerably in excess of the policy limits. Having investigated the claim thoroughly, the company decided to pay out $200,000 in full and final settlement, this being the limit of the cover afforded by the insurance policy. The cost of the rectification being considerably in excess of the limit, these terms were accepted by Senator Coonan. I table this statement. Apparently, when you become a minister, your husband is no longer allowed to own any property and you are not allowed, if you have a valid insurance claim, to make the claim. You are not allowed to do anything. And you have your reputation dragged through the newspapers. Frankly, given the strength of the denial and the response of Royal and SunAlliance, I do not think credit is due to the newspaper that ran the story. It only gave currency to something that is absolutely false and malicious.  - The minister, on the basis of this, has behaved as any other citizen would do if they had an insurance claim. According to the fervid logic of those who sit opposite, because she had some ministerial responsibility for insurance, she had to delegate to somebody else the settlement of her own claim. That is the equivalent of saying that, if the minister for health belongs to a private health insurance fund, she is not allowed to make a claim. It is absolutely ridiculous, and there is no evidence that the minister has behaved improperly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for allowing us to address this substantial issue. It is important for honourable members to know that our measures to deal with unauthorised boat arrivals have been extraordinarily successful - so successful, Treasurer, that I note in the additional estimates that have just been tabled that something of the order of $75 million worth of savings have been declared. The budget initially provided funding of $240 million, based upon estimated arrivals of 4,500 people. That estimate has been reduced to 2,500, but if the number of new arrivals remains at current low levels, there will be further savings this financial year. That follows on from savings last year of something of the order of $47 million. So, at this stage, the funding required to process 2,500 unauthorised arrivals and to manage people currently held in offshore processing centres is estimated at $165 million. Clearly, the success of our strategies has been good for the budget, good for the nation and good for refugees, because we can now accommodate those who are genuinely in need of a resettlement place through a properly structured program. But it is not good news for the opposition. They have now launched a policy on this. I think it is a policy for the present, although they told me last week it would be a policy for an election. If it is a policy for an election, you have to be prepared to look at the commitments it makes and at how they stack up in terms of being fiscally responsible. - The shadow minister says they have done it. They say, `We can fund all our commitments, including outlays, through savings from ending the Pacific solution.' That is the statement they make. The cost of all unauthorised arrivals was $165 million. That includes the Pacific solution and those who were detained onshore. We have had commitments from the opposition of $2 billion over the forward estimates period. The shadow Treasurer ought to be cognisant of this, because he will be held responsible in relation to it. We have seen already very precise commitments from the opposition, in their policy, to change the balance in the overall migration intake with the humanitarian program. I pointed out the other day that, on the forward estimates, if you take fewer skilled migrants to take 9,000 additional refugees, you are looking, over the -  - That is exactly what it said. - If it is not what it said, you should clarify what it said. But that is what it said. The fact is they want to change the balance to put it back to where they say it was. Eighteen per cent of the program is what you held out. Did you put those words in and expect people to ignore them? The fact is that they were there. It is a $1.2 billion change. Then you have the cost of the alternative detention arrangements, which is $90 million, and the monitoring of returned asylum seekers, which is $40 million. If you want to look at the other big-ticket items, just go through them. The other big-ticket items include a new refugee determination tribunal - $36 million; and TPV access to settlement services - $36.3 million. - There is an increase in the core funding for the UNHCR - $18 million; and an inspector-general of detention - in excess of $8 million if you use the Ombudsman as a guide. We read elsewhere today that there will be a children's commissioner - another $8 million. They seriously want us to believe that you can introduce a green card without costs. I have not costed that yet. They have the idea of rejigging, in Australia Card mode, the tax file number regime. That is the point that you make. You have a secret agenda to bring back the Australia Card. - You have the additional AFP officers that they have said they are committed to. You have the extension of the role of the ambassador for people-smuggling. You have community hostels. You have immunisation. - I have not finished on the number of commitments that have been made in this so-called policy document. But in any situation where you are a serious, creditable party seeking election, you cost your proposals and you set them out in detail. When you come along with a coastguard commitment as well that involves another $600 million, you cannot be a serious -  - Mr Speaker, perhaps you are not the opposition; I appreciate that. The opposition cannot be a serious, creditable party seeking election to the government of Australia when they go out there with uncosted proposals which are demonstrably of the order of $2 billion over the forward estimates period.</DOC>

 - I cannot guarantee the letterheads on which ministers write without asking them. But the fact that she might write a personal letter on a ministerial letterhead is not, in my language, a hanging offence, although it would not normally be the practice. I would be fascinated to know what might be turned up if we had an audit of ministerial letterheads of the former government. It would be very interesting. I have something that is far more relevant than whether you write a letter on your ministerial or private letterhead. I have been handed a statement, dated 12 December.Opposition members - Another one? - Yes, another one. I am very happy to keep providing these statements, because you are never frightened of questions when you know that there is not a lot of substance in them. It is a statement by Stephen Abbott - no relation - dated 12 December 2002. Because it bears very directly on the question asked by the member for Werriwa and the previous question, I am going to read the statement in full. It says:1.	I was engaged in November 2000 to inspect the renovations that had been carried out to the private residence in Woollahra of Senator Coonan for defective work.2.	My initial assessment of the cost of rectifying the renovations was $60,000-$80,000. This was an initial assessment that was made before the scope of works had been fully resolved with the insurer and their experts. The final scope resolved varies significantly from that envisaged in my original assessment. This early estimate was also qualified and always subject to testing via quotes from contractors given the nature of the work to be done.3.	I had a number of discussions with the builder by phone and in person concerning the rectification work that was required. Whilst the builder was willing to accept responsibility for some of the work on a without prejudice basis, he refused to accept some of the major items. I formed the view that we would not be able to come to suitable terms for him to rectify the defects.4.	After Senator Coonan made a claim under the Home HoHome OwnjklOwners Warranty Insurance in about March 2001, I started to work with the insurer and their experts to establish the scope of the rectification work required.5.	I had numerous meetings and discussions with the insurer's building expert during 2001 and 2002. Between them the claims manager and the building expert carried out repeated inspections of the premises and there were lengthy delays in the process as the independent expert wanted to be satisfied in detail about various matters.I stress that - `the independent expert wanted to be satisfied in detail about various matters'. He goes on:6.	Once the scope of works was essentially completed, there was further delay as the insurer obtained a quote from a builder of its choice for carrying out the work required.7.	It was not until late April 2002 that the insurer's builder first provided a quote in the sum of $331,430 -  - The tsar of Australian insurance lawyers! The statement continues:The detailed quote provided by the insurer's builder reflects a thorough and reasonable assessment of the scope of the rectifications considering the nature of the works to be completed. It is also fair to say that significant differences in the quoted prices may be experienced between different contractors quoting the rectification work due to the nature of the rectification works and the availability of appropriate contractors. 8.	After the settlement between Senator Coonan and the insurer, I approached a number of builders requesting them to provide quotes and to undertake the rectification work. I was unsuccessful in obtaining a quote from any builder other than the insurer's builder until a matter of a few days ago. That quote is still in negotiation.There are two other paragraphs that are not particularly material, but I am going to table the statement, and I will not weary the House with reading those other two paragraphs. This completely and comprehensively debunks any suggestion either by the member for Werriwa or by the Sydney Morning Herald. Here we have an allegation that has been made. You have a statement from Royal and SunAlliance, and you have a statement by Mr Abbott, which goes into detail. I tabled both of the documents.I again say to the House that this is nothing other than a continuation of a very unworthy attack on the minister. It will not pass the attention of the House that, in a week in which the Leader of the Opposition has declared that he is a person for the long policy haul, a person who is interested in bringing about fundamental change in the Australian society and a person of ideas, the only thing they can gather any energy for is not a policy issue and not something that is important to the future of this country. By a factor of five or 10, they have spent more questions, more time and more energy on unworthily trying to attack the character and the decency of a minister than they have on anything else. That will not be lost on the Australian people. They have muckraked. They have unfairly attacked the character of a minister who is doing a first-class job. There is no evidence to support any of the allegations. They have been comprehensively refuted. It will be a measure of the reaction of the Australian public that they will see very poor priorities from this opposition. As we come near to the end of the last question time for this year, it is a metaphor of the opposition this year: irrelevance, muckraking and character assassination.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I think it is probably his last question in this House as a single man. We congratulate him on his wedding at the end of the month, and we send our regards to the lovely Kate too. We look forward to a very happy occasion. - He will be eligible in due course for baby bonuses and all sorts of other things. - You do have to go home if you want to get that baby bonus, that is for sure. One of the major changes the government put in place to ensure the tax system works on a better basis was the new tax system, with the Australian Business Number and the coverage of the goods and services tax. The Australian national auditor endorsed in March this year a tax office figure saying that this had resulted in over $3 billion in revenue in three years collected from the black economy. Giving the tax office the tools and introducing a broad based consumption tax are already generating important measures in relation to the black economy. The government has recently increased resources to the tax office to assist it in bringing further areas of the black economy into the tax system. A key priority for the tax office remains big business and high-wealth individuals and, in the past five years, its extensive audit program on the big end of business has netted an extra $2.64 billion for the community. In addition, this year one in 10 businesses will be subject to some form of audit and more than 135,000 people will be required to confirm their tax deductions.For the first time ever, the tax office has put out a compliance plan which has profiled risks in the community and indicated those areas which the tax office will be intensely scrutinising, including aggressive tax planning, the cash economy, work related and rental property expenses, correct reporting of capital gains and losses, illegal tobacco and fuel substitution. In addition, the government is announcing today new section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve the effectiveness of the deemed dividend rules so as to more effectively prevent beneficiaries accessing trust income that has borne tax only at the company tax rate. The commissioner's plan, the compliance program, which was released yesterday - and I will table a copy in the House - is a first. It indicates those areas where the commissioner will be taking extensive steps in addition to those already in place, and it indicates that the tax office will be taking those high-profile and high-risk areas and ensuring that there is adequate scrutiny to assure the community that tax is being paid on a fair basis. </DOC>

 - It would have been self-evident to the insurance company from, I suppose, December or January that Senator Coonan was the minister responsible for the matters she was responsible for. - As to whether in the course of that she may have used her letterhead, I will offer the view that it is the totality of her conduct that matters. It clearly would have been improper for her to have sought to prosecute an unreasonable claim, but this was a reasonable claim. I have demonstrated that -  - This was a completely reasonable claim. The issue is the minister's conduct. What the Leader of the Opposition is saying and what the member for Werriwa is saying is that, if you have a claim, you have no right to pursue it because you are a minister. - Oh, they're not saying that! - You are not saying that. - This claim was entirely proper, and the minister's conduct stands or falls on that. The minister had a right to pursue the claim. She pursued it. We have independent verification of the fact that it was a reasonable claim. We have a statement from the insurance company saying it was reasonable. Yet, in the face of that, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Werriwa continue to pursue the matter. It is very interesting that, in the last question time of the year, at 20 past three, there have been four questions on Senator Coonan and one question on policy. - I hope they do. The more they keep coming, the more you proclaim your irrelevance to the public policy debate in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and for his concern to see a better social security system. I should point out to the House that by international standards Australia does have a good and tightly targeted social security system, but I also have to say that well-intentioned and mostly ad hoc changes prior to 1996 mean that still, for far too many people, work is more trouble than it is worth and for too many Australians there is too much focus on what they cannot do rather than on what they can do. This government has already taken very significant steps to improve incentives to work. In the new tax system, effective marginal tax rates on all incomes under $60,000 were reduced by between three and 13 per cent. I congratulate the Treasurer for the outstanding work he has done to improve work incentives. The Working Credit initiative in last year's budget means that, for those vital first few weeks of employment, people moving from welfare to work get to keep more of their income. Changes to the Job Network mean constant engagement with job seekers such that it should no longer be possible for people to lose their jobs and disappear into the system, only to emerge years later as part of the problem of entrenched, long-term welfare dependency.Despite all these beneficial changes, there is more work that needs to be done to address the problem of poverty traps in this country. Today, Senator Vanstone and I launched a public discussion paper about the long-term architecture of the social security system. I should stress that this is not about cutting welfare; it is about making work pay. I should also stress that it is a discussion paper, not a policy paper; it is about promoting debate, not about flagging government decision making. I have to say that this is a debate that will test the maturity of our polity. Even today, there were people out there in the media trying to discover potential victims and prepare a future scare campaign. I think it is important that in this debate, above all else, we have less focus on `What's in it for me?' and more focus on `What's in it for Australia?'I have been asked about alternative policy. It is pretty obvious today that the policy of the opposition is grubby personal muckraking led by the shadow minister for community security, whose latest stunt is to sneak his staffer into the Lodge. He preaches community security and he practices home invasion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question and for the opportunity to outline some of the very positive achievements of the Howard government in a year when the opposition has been in a complete void. The Howard government have not only provided sound economic management, we are also getting right behind Australia's industry with the $3 billion Backing Australia's Ability program. As the Treasurer said earlier, we have shown the way by ensuring that our economy is amongst the fastest growing in the OECD.The government has achieved a great deal of success with a number of programs, right across the board, that promote innovation and the funding of innovation. This year alone, there have been 549 R&amp;D Start projects, worth $155 million in grants and loans. I was hoping the member for Rankin would interject, notwithstanding his status in the House. - Of course, that is triple the level of grants supplied by the Labor Party in their last year in office. R&amp;D Start projects are not the only area of success. There were 68 BIF grants to the tune of $7½ million, and 420 COMET projects received $11 million. As well as that, the Howard government introduced significant measures to promote venture capital funding in Australia. A revamped Invest Australia attracted some 55 new investments last financial year. There were economic boosts such as the $2 billion extra expenditure on the gas (LNG) train and pipeline at the Burrup Peninsula. Who could forget the $25 billion contract for LNG to China. This government continues to secure the future of Australian industry and it will soon be announcing a package that will secure the future of the Australian automotive industry.I was asked by the member for Forrest about alternative policies. There is a very stark contrast. The member for Rankin's only contribution this year -  - You said you didn't have any! And he did not have any. The only contribution this year was a cobbling together of caveats in what was supposed to be a discussion paper. It is interesting to read what the discussion paper says. It carries a disclaimer. - I have never seen a discussion paper that carries such a disclaimer. It says:Policy options canvassed are not meant to be exhaustive, nor is Labor necessarily advocating them at this stage.They do not stand behind their policies, just like they do not stand behind their leader. Right from the start there is a catch in the discussion paper. When you read further, it says:Ultimately, all these policy areas will be integrated, but seeking to do so at this early stage of developing ideas would be overly ambitious.`Overly ambitious'? Six years in opposition and all they can come up with is a discussion paper which is `overly ambitious' if they were to adopt anything from it at this stage. Labor are really saying, `These may be the policies we will have one day, but we will check with our Labor mates in the unions first.' After 12 months of this government, the ALP have no policies, no direction and no leadership.</DOC>

 - The substance and the basis of the question is wrong. The basis of the question is that Senator Coonan's claim was unreasonable. I have produced evidence from the insurance company and also from an independent source that totally repudiate that. So the whole basis of the question is completely false.</DOC>

 - I am greatly indebted to the member for Macquarie for raising an issue which is of great interest to all Australians. It is important in this last question time for the year that we turn our attention back to issues that people are really concerned about - issues that affect their lives, particularly the lives of young Australians. I know that all members of the House will be pleased to see recent advice from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre that fatal heroin overdoses in the 15 to 44 age range fell by 58 per cent in 2001, following a fall of 24 per cent in the year 2000. These figures are very encouraging. I do not claim that we have turned the corner in fighting the drug menace, but I do claim that the policies that we have pursued - with the full cooperation, I am happy to say, of state Labor governments - have begun to make a contribution to turning around in a favourable way the fight against the drug scourge. Since 1997, at a federal level, we have committed $625 million to our Tough on Drugs strategy, which balances law enforcement and anti-drug trafficking efforts with drug treatment and education programs.The reduction in heroin overdose deaths is not the only positive sign. Over the last three years there has been a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people reporting use of illicit drugs. Almost six tonnes of illicit drugs have been seized since the Tough on Drugs campaign started. These seizures and associated arrests have contributed to the disruption of major heroin importation and distribution networks. In the year from July 2000 to June 2001, there were 30,000 treatments provided for drug users by Tough on Drugs funded treatment services - up from around 19,000 in the previous year. As the parliamentary secretary and my colleague the member for Adelaide confirmed yesterday, a further $64 million will be allocated next year to non-government treatment facilities, in line with our 2001 election commitment. A further major success was the 2001 national illicit drugs campaign. The evaluation of that campaign showed that 78 per cent of parents surveyed spoke more frequently to their children about drugs as a result of the campaign. Our commitment to the COAG Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative is also helping drug users to get off drugs and stay out of the criminal justice system. Earlier in question time I was critical of the failure of state premiers in the area of drought relief. In relation to diversion initiatives for drugs, I want to record my thanks to the premiers of Australia - the Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the other states - for their willingness to cooperate. They recognise that one of the greatest obligations that we have in public life, whether at a national level or a state level, is to combine across the party divide to deal with massive social problems. There is nothing that terrorises the parents of Australia more than the possibility that their children should become drug addicts. It is the nightmare of all parents of children at a vulnerable age.I do not claim that we have all the answers and I do not claim for a moment that we have seen anything other than some promising signs. But policies have been adopted which might over time bring about an improvement. The path to success does not lie in giving in to the drug barons; it does not lie in giving in to the harm minimisation philosophy; it does not lie in heroin injecting rooms; it does not lie in legalising the use of heroin in our community. The path ahead lies in a mix of policies where there is cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. I think the Australian people applaud and support that. On that note, which is so relevant to the lives of the future - that is, the young people of Australia - Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. </DOC>
