         (1) Can he confirm that at the Kyoto climate change conference on 11 December 1997, and with the full support of the Federal Cabinet and Coalition parties, the (then) Prime Minister and Minister for the Environment negotiated and formed 'The Australian Clause' of the Kyoto Protocol (Article 3.7), allowing Annex I parties to include greenhouse gas emissions from land use change in 1990-base year calculations.         (2) Can he confirm the accuracy of Mr Clive Hamilton's statement in his speech The Political Economy of Climate Change (The Milthorpe Lecture, Macquarie University, Sydney, 8 June 2006): 'The Government knew that land clearing had declined sharply since the accepted base year of 1990, so even before the ink was dry, Australia's emissions had fallen by 5 to 10 percent_'.         (3) Is it a fact that after the Kyoto climate change conference the (then) Government paid the Queensland and NSW governments in excess of $100 million to introduce more restrictive native vegetation laws which limited property rights on approximately 100 million hectares of privately owned farming land; if so, is it a fact that to date no monetary compensation has been made to these land owners; if so, what responsibility does the Government take for the diminished income of affected landholders.         (4) Is it a fact that since the Kyoto climate change conference, Article 3.7 has resulted in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to 87.5 million tonnes between 1990 and 2003; if so, does Government data support that this has enabled Australia to make significant gains towards meeting its Kyoto Protocol target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 108 per cent of 1990 emissions.         (5) Can he confirm that the United Nations Association of Australia commented on Australia's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol in 2007 by saying: 'the real challenge of reducing GHG emissions is from electricity generation and transport which have yet to be addressed.'; if so, is it an accurate statement. </title></top>

Priority sales usually occur where a sale to a State, Territory or Local Government would optimise housing and/or community outcomes. Concessional sales are those priority sales concluded at a purchase price below market value in cases where the sale facilitates a Commonwealth policy objective.

(3) The savings measure is applied to agencies that exceeded the occupational density target where the lease/building contains more than 500 m² of usable office area. The savings are realised progressively as existing leases expire.         Over the period 2010-11 to 2014-15 inclusive, the Commonwealth anticipates realising efficiencies delivering $145.6 million in savings from improved property management practices with $48.5 million retained by agencies and $97.1 million returned to the Budget.         A breakdown of these figures per financial year is below:                    (4) (a)         The Whole-of-government ICT Strategic Workforce Plan 2010-2013 (Workforce Plan) was jointly released by the former Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Hon Lindsay Tanner and the former Special Minister of State Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig on 29 April 2010. For more information: http://www2.financeminister.gov.au/archive/media/2010/mr_152010_joint.html          The Workforce Plan is underpinned by an ICT Capability Framework, which is built upon an internationally recognised ICT capability model  -  the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). This capability framework also forms an essential component of the whole-of-government ICT Career Structure.          The ICT Career Structure identifies and defines the contributions made by ICT professionals across the APS at different classification levels. It provides a consistent approach to describing ICT occupations, helps to build a better understanding of the ICT workforce to inform workforce planning and describes career paths available for employees across the APS.          Of the 98          Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997          (FMA Act) agencies covered by the          Public Service Act 1999          , 8 per cent were excluded on the basis that they did not have an ICT workforce. Of those remaining, approximately 84 per cent completed an ICT workforce plan covering approximately 97 per cent of the ICT workforce.          Of the remaining 11 FMA Act agencies that are covered by legislation other than the Public Service Act approximately 45 per cent completed an ICT workforce plan. The majority of agencies that did not submit an ICT workforce plan had fewer than 20 ICT employees.         (b) This question should be referred to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.         (5) Australian Government departments and agencies spent a total of $112.8 million on advertising campaigns in 2010, compared with $115.3 million in 2009, $86.6 million in 2008 and $254 million in 2007.         (6) Savings were incorporated within a one-off additional 2 per cent efficiency dividend, implemented by Government with effect from 1 March 2008. A specific target for consultancy expenditure was not set.         (7) All 29 sites are now operational, with 5 additional sites installed to support initiatives such as the Queensland Floods Recovery and CHOGM Taskforce.         (8) Yes.          (9) Pre-2008 Review of Subordinate Regulation         The Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Senator the Hon Nick Sherry, announced the completion of the systematic review of all Commonwealth subordination legislation made before 2008 (Pre-2008 Review) on 31 March 2011.         Across portfolios as a whole, the Pre-2008 Review identified 4,204 legislative instruments, or around 14 per cent of the stock, that were redundant or potentially redundant. In the process of identifying the redundant regulations, 10 Acts were also identified that appear to be redundant.         All portfolio ministers have received and acknowledged the final report of the review in respect of their portfolio. Responsibility to action the findings of each report now lies with individual ministers.          Regulatory Offsets         In 2009 a Department of Finance and Deregulation circular provided guidance on the 'one in, one out' principle and a range of other regulatory matters.          Ministerial Partnerships         Five Better Regulation Ministerial Partnerships have now been completed. Three Partnerships are currently in progress.         (10) The Commonwealth Grants Guidelines, introduced on 1 July 2009, require agencies to report information on all individual grants on their department websites no later than seven working days after the funding agreement for the grant takes effect.         In the 2009-10 Certificate of Compliance process, about 14 per cent of agencies reported non-compliance with the seven day website reporting requirement. The majority of these were reported within 20 days of the funding agreement taking effect.         (11) A register of agencies using social media initiatives is available at http://agimo.govspace.gov.au/page/gov2register/, and case studies on Gov 2.0 are available at http://showcase.govspace.gov.au/showcase_types/gov-2-0/. The Government's use of Gov 2.0 has also been reported in the State of the Service Report 2009-10.         (12) The balances of funds remaining in the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund, including the uncommitted balances and the cash balances, can be found on the Department of Finance and Deregulation website - http://www.finance.gov.au/investment-funds/NBF/NBF_transfers.html.         (13) Legislation to establish the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation as the single trustee for the main Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation schemes was introduced into Parliament on 4 February 2010, but lapsed when the 42nd Parliament ended prior to the 2010 election. The legislation was re-introduced into Parliament on 24 March 2011, and received Royal Assent on 28 June 2011. The legislation, known as the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011, commenced on 1 July 2011.         (14) This question should be directed to the Minister for Human Services.         (15) (a) Courier services - A preliminary investigation was undertaken in 2010. It identified that further investigation is required in order to determine whether courier services is a viable candidate for a coordinated arrangement. An agency survey will be undertaken to more accurately estimate expenditure and identify scope. The timing of the action is not yet finalised.         (b) Office removals and staff relocations - A preliminary investigation was completed in 2010. It identified that office removals and staff relocations is not a suitable candidate for a whole of government arrangement as a large number of agencies would not benefit. As such, this area did not meet the coordinated procurement contracting arrangements criteria.         (c) Travel services - Phase 1 of the travel services coordinated procurement processes took effect from 1 July 2010. Under those arrangements, a panel of travel management companies was established through which all FMA Act agencies and relevant participating Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 bodies must book air travel. A range of competitive discounted airfares was negotiated with airlines on domestic and international routes. These arrangements have delivered $160 million savings to the Budget over the period 2010-14.         Phase 2 has now commenced, involving the conduct of separate open tenders for travel and related card services, accommodation and short-term car hire services. The tenders for Phase 2 are expected to be released later in 2011, with contracts to be in place by mid 2012.         The Department of Finance and Deregulation has recently undertaken a Request for Information process for travel and related card services to provide industry the opportunity to contribute to considerations about the most appropriate strategy and business model. A similar Request for Information process is being undertaken in relation to accommodation.         (d) Security guarding services - A preliminary investigation was completed in 2010. It identified that security guarding services is not a suitable candidate for coordinated procurement as a minority of agencies had specific contracts and some agencies had these services tied in with other property management arrangements. As such, this area did not meet the coordinated procurement contracting arrangements criteria.         (e) Transactional banking services - A preliminary investigation was undertaken in 2010, which identified that transactional banking is not a suitable candidate for coordinated procurement as there is minimal potential for savings. As such, this area did not meet the coordinated procurement contracting arrangements criteria.         (f) Subscription services - A preliminary investigation was completed in the last quarter of 2010. It identified a wide diversity in subscription services and that many subscriptions were specific to one or a few agencies. Therefore it is not a suitable candidate for coordinated procurement when assessed against the criteria. </title></top>
