 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. Let me first say that I do condemn - and the government condemns - the violent protests that we have seen in Lebanon, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and, indeed, a number of other countries. This violence has been directed mainly at Danish and Norwegian interests, simply because these were the countries in which these cartoons were published. There has been some backlash to New Zealand as well.But let me make this clear: we regard the backlash as indefensible and urge people to desist and remain calm. In this country, of course, we believe in the right to protest, but we only believe in the right to protest peacefully - not violently: not to burn down buildings and not to threaten people. If people do take offence at anything - and this happens from time to time in any society - if they are exercised about anything, they have a right to protest, but they should not resort to violence.We hear reports that up to five people have been killed in these protests. There is no doubt that the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad have caused offence to many Muslims, and that is unfortunate. But the decision about whether to publish such material is in the end a matter for the media. Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of a democratic society, not just in this country but in democratic societies all around the world.Suffice it to say that with all freedoms, with all rights, come responsibilities, and any media organisation which publishes this material will obviously have given consideration to what the consequences of doing so might be. But, having said that, at the end of the day, in a free society, people have a right to express their views. If others disagree with those views or are offended by those views, they have absolutely the right to protest, to object, but only in peaceful ways.While I will not go into the details of the security provisions at Australian missions overseas, let me just say that our mission in Ramallah in the Palestinian territories has been closed temporarily because it shares a building with the Danish mission. Of course, the Danish mission has been particularly subjected to protests. We are liaising to ensure the security of Danish consulates here in Australia. There is not a Danish embassy, but there are consulates. We are obviously focused on the security of those missions.Today my department is reissuing its travel advisories for Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Iran, noting that large demonstrations related to this issue have taken place in those countries and advising Australians to avoid any further such protests and to exercise good personal security awareness.</DOC>

 - That statement was based on quite widely circulated material - and I refer in particular to an address by the British foreign secretary, Mr Jack Straw; for the benefit of the member, I will get him the precise reference - and also plenty of open source reports at the time which suggested that a number of things were happening: that Saddam was selling oil on a bilateral basis to bypass the UN sanction and was also adopting the practice of leaving unspent amounts in the United Nations escrow account and then pointing to the inevitable suffering of his own people to support his argument that the suffering was due to the behaviour of the allies. That is the basis of the claim, and it is totally accurate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and recognise the enormous input into the local economy in his area that exports have, particularly from small and medium sized enterprises. Figures were released last week that indicated that in 2005 Australia reached a new annual record of exports, of $176.7 billion, a 15 per cent increase on 2004, which was also a significant figure. I will just repeat it: $176.7 billion in 2005.We saw new annual records set across a number of areas, particularly - obviously - in the resources sector, but also in the services sector. Interestingly, manufactured exports rose by nine per cent. Contrary to all the doom-saying comments by the Australian Labor Party, manufacturing exports rose by nine per cent. Australia's export businesses deserve to be congratulated for this result, achieved in different global economic circumstances. We have taken the advantage where we have competitive advantages, and obviously in the resources sector. Australian exporters are taking up the opportunities provided by our government's strong economic record, the stability of the economy and our trade policies in terms of opening up markets across the world.It was interesting to note within those figures that 12 out of our top 20 export products reached new record levels - and not just resources, not just commodity exports. Coal, iron ore, education, beef, aluminium ores, natural gas, professional and business services, passenger motor vehicles, medicines, alcoholic beverages, including wine, and copper ores all reached new record levels in 2005. So 12 out of our top 20 exports reached new records. What are the private sector forecasters indicating is going to happen? I quote the ANZ Economic Outlook:The Australian economy will return to the good times over the next two years on the back of solid business investment, a strengthening in resources and rural exports.So the path that the government have gone down in terms of our policy settings to ensure that the economic environment and the workplace structures in Australia are ripe to take advantage of opportunities in the future is absolutely the right one. It was opposed all the way by the Australian Labor Party, but we will continue to work with and listen to the job creators in our country.</DOC>

 - At that time it was common between the government and the opposition that the AWB was an organisation of total integrity and repute. On 6 June 2003, three months after I made my statement to the parliament, there was a response to the allegations made by the American Wheat Associates - allegations, incidentally, as to their detail before the commission. Mr Cole has indicated that he will be very carefully examining the role of the AWB and also the Commonwealth in relation to that issue. This is what the then shadow minister for primary industries, Senator Kerry O'Brien, and the then trade spokesman, Craig Emerson, had to say, such was their belief in the integrity of AWB Ltd -  - They said:In the absence of evidence to support the allegation, Australian wheat growers are entitled to dismiss the claims as an attempt to promote the sale of US subsidised wheat in the Iraq market.We had received no credible advice or evidence to doubt the integrity of AWB Ltd. That was a view that I retained well beyond the date quoted by the Leader of the Opposition. If he is honest with himself, so did he.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Since the House last met we have had the consumer price index for the December quarter, which showed an increase of 0.5 per cent in the quarter and 2.8 per cent through the year. These were very good outcomes, considering the pressure that petrol prices are putting on the economy and on inflation generally. We cannot afford to be complacent about this. There will be further pressure in the current quarter, but the important thing is to make sure that we do not have second-round effects, with petrol prices feeding into prices generally.We have had, since the House last met, labour force figures for the month of December showing that unemployment remains at a 29-year low, at 5.1 per cent. We have also had moderate retail trade figures showing that in the December quarter retail trade volumes rose by 0.3 per cent to be 1.9 per cent higher than a year ago. As we have just heard from the Deputy Prime Minister, we have had welcome recovery in the trade performance, with a substantial increase in exports. All of this says that the Australian economy is in a strong position going forward, but we cannot afford to be complacent.At the time of the last election I described the economy as a highly tuned performance car which, if you fiddled with modifications in different parts, you could knock off balance and easily turn into a mangled wreck. I had in mind the damage that could have been done to the Australian economy if Labor had been elected in October 2004. - If you want a picture of what the Australian economy could have looked like had Labor been elected, it would have looked much like the camera of the Daily Telegraph photographer after the former leader of the Labor Party got to it. If he could do that to a camera, what could he have done to the Australian economy? He was the man put forward by every single member of the Australian Labor Party to be Prime Minister, to have his hands on the levers of the Australian economy. The damage that was done to the Daily Telegraph camera pales into insignificance when compared to the damage that could have been done by Mr Mark Latham. The important thing in economic management is to have people who are stable, who know what they are doing and who are restrained. The Labor Party have not learned their lesson. They lined up to a man and to a woman to put forward for Prime Minister the member for Werriwa at the last election, and they have learned nothing in relation to economic policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This is an issue that has been canvassed at length. If I can just make a couple of points. In response to the January 2000 allegation, DFAT contacted AWB and it categorically denied the allegation. Bear in mind that the allegation came without any evidence - there was no evidence. In March, when the UN noted continuing concern about the matter and raised specific questions over contract conditions, DFAT obtained from AWB the requested paperwork and passed it on to the UN. This resolved the matter to the UN's satisfaction, the UN saying it had removed any grounds for misperception. Can we make one point very clear in this. It was always the UN's role to approve the oil for food contracts, including assessing value and price, not that of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Stirling. I know what a lot of interest he has in international relations and what a good job he is doing in Stirling as well. At the recent Board of Governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, of which Australia is a member, Australia supported the resolution which reports Iran's nuclear program to the United Nations Security Council, and we welcome the very strong support by other members of the board for that resolution. I attended a meeting of a number of foreign ministers in London, primarily to discuss the issue of Afghanistan. Also, during a dinner we were able to focus substantially on Iran. I am pleased to say that there is a very widespread - it is not complete but very widespread - consensus in the international community on how to deal with this issue.Let us just remember what the simple facts are here. Iran has failed to give credible assurances to the international community that it is not developing a nuclear weapons capability. A nuclear armed Iran would have dire consequences for regional and international security. Reporting Iran to the Security Council is a response - and, I think, a necessary response - to Iran's lengthy and well-documented record of concealing nuclear activities from the IAEA and to its continuing failure to cooperate fully with the IAEA. This, by the way, I think is essential to enhancing the IAEA's authority to investigate Iran's nuclear activities. We remain, of course, committed to a diplomatic solution. Reporting Iran to the Security Council is not the end of diplomatic efforts, but it does mark a new phase in these efforts. The door is still open for Iran to take the steps necessary to restore international confidence. We urge Iran to comply with the board's latest resolution, including resuming full suspension of its enrichment related activities.To be honest - and many members of the House would agree with this - international concerns about Iran's nuclear program have been increased by statements made by the President of Iran expressing a desire to wipe Israel off the map and other, I think, deeply offensive comments about Israel and Jewish people more generally. There is no doubt about it: the rhetoric of the Iranian regime causes deep concern and, considering at the same time that Iran is moving towards the enrichment of uranium and thereby getting closer to a capacity to build nuclear weapons, it is only understandable that the international community is deeply concerned about this. Australia has been playing a key role in ensuring that international efforts are constructive and forceful. We hope that in time they will turn out to be effective.</DOC>

 - The point that I was making in reference to the question that was last asked by the member for Griffith was that the UN oil for food contracts were the responsibility of the UN's section 661 sanctions committee. In terms of an export, after the contracts were certified and signed off on by the UN, we issued export permits. We had nothing to do with the pricing of the contracts or the contracts themselves. The UN's responsibility was the oil for food contracts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I acknowledge his work over many years as a clinician and also his current contributions to public policy in this House. I can inform him and other members that, ever since the government received official advice about the general medical workforce shortage in this country, we have been substantially increasing the number of medical training places. Since 2000 there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of first-year places in Australia's medical schools. Last year there were some 1,300 medical graduates around Australia, and it is anticipated that, on current policies, there will be 2,100 medical graduates by the year 2011. That is a 60 per cent increase, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.Yesterday the Queensland Premier spent $150,000 on ads claiming that the federal government had somehow short-changed the people of Queensland. Even on Premier Beattie's own figures, the number of Queensland medical graduates has increased by some 25 per cent since 1996. But what Premier Beattie did not say was that between 1983 and 1995, when the population of Queensland increased by 30 per cent, the number of Queensland medical graduates actually decreased by six per cent under the policies of the Hawke-Keating government. What Premier Beattie also did not say was that there were just over 200 first-year medical students a year in Queensland under the former Labor government; this year, under this government, 404 students will commence publicly funded medical training in Queensland. I have a very simple piece of advice for the Queensland Premier: he should spend his taxpayers' money fixing the Queensland public hospital system and not telling fibs about the federal government.</DOC>

 - With regard to the correspondence that the member refers to, obviously as the Chairman of the Wheat Board Mr Flugge corresponded with me from time to time on a whole range of issues. On the specific issue that the member raises with regard to the AWB-DFAT exchange of letters, it was in reference to a general inquiry on the possible use of Jordanian transport companies, and the exchange contained no mention of the specific company. As Volcker and Cole have highlighted, AWB had already been using Alia for around a year prior to the AWB letter.I just make the point here that the Volcker inquiry has forensically investigated the oil for food program. It requested that governments that had companies involved in the oil for food program conduct an inquiry into whether domestic laws had been broken in those countries. That is what we are doing. The Cole commission of inquiry is under way now and is part heard. Commissioner Cole made very clear his intentions in his statement last Friday. I think the best thing to do is to allow him to conduct his work, complete the inquiry and come back with his conclusions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question, because obviously there is no doubt that identity fraud is a growing problem confronting law enforcement agencies in all our jurisdictions. In the year 2001-02 the annual cost of identity fraud in Australia was estimated at $1.1 billion, and false identities can underpin terrorist and criminal activity. It is essential in Australia's interests, both economic and security, that the identity of persons accessing government services, benefits, official documents and positions of trust can be accurately identified.Last year we funded the development of a prototype document verification service as part of a national identity security strategy. I am pleased to advise the House that that prototype went live today. It initially involved some 50,000 passport applications and some citizenship applications. When people present documents, officials will be able to check online the authenticity of that proof of identity document with the issuing agency. I am confident that this new system will become a powerful means of verifying the legitimacy of Australian passports, citizenship certificates, birth certificates and drivers licences issued by other jurisdictions. Privacy is particularly important in this process, and the pilot has been developed so that no personal information is stored in the system.There can be no greater invasion of a person's privacy than the theft of their identity. That is why we are constantly looking at ways to strengthen our national identity security regime. This new measure is a practical demonstration of that commitment, and it will help to protect Australians from the impact of identity crime.</DOC>

 - Can I just make a couple of points -  -  - Can I just make a couple of points in response to that question and the assertions that were made in it. Firstly, I make the point that, all through this entire process, the objective of our government has been to look after the interests of Australia's wheat growers. They come first and foremost in this process in terms of getting into the markets of the world. - I am trying to respond to the member's question. I am sure he wants an answer. First and foremost has been exercising our responsibilities as a government to the wheat growers of Australia, to get their export product on the markets of the world. The other part of the question was with regard to the structure of contracts. The structure of contracts was purely a matter between AWB and the United Nations. The third point I want to make is that - and the member for Griffith, seeing as he has been an avid reader of a lot of the correspondence and the documentation that has come forward in this inquiry, would realise this - in every bit of correspondence there was a warning to AWB to be compliant with the conditions of the UN sanctions program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and outstanding representation of the 3,500 Defence personnel in Townsville. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, they have no greater advocate. On 8 October last year an earthquake struck Pakistan with devastating human, economic and environmental consequences. On 9 November last year the Prime Minister announced the deployment of approximately 142 Australian Defence Force personnel to Pakistan. They are currently based at Dhanni, about 20 kilometres north-east of Muzaffarabad. I would also point out that they are working in very difficult terrain and in subzero temperatures as low as 20 degrees below zero Celsius. They have treated 8,200 Pakistani people with life-saving medical and surgical treatments. They have also rebuilt a school in the area where they are working. The four S-70A Black Hawk helicopters that have also been deployed are enabling the health care team to provide services in the region beyond Dhanni, where they are actually based. We are extremely proud of the fact also that about a third of those who have been deployed are reservists. I would pay particular tribute to the nursing and medical staff who are reservists who have left not only their families but their practices to provide a practical illustration of Australian Defence Force personnel working seamlessly with reservists and those who are in the permanent ADF.The Australian government has contributed almost $17 million to these activities since the deployment on 9 November. Shortly we expect the task before them to have been completed. On behalf of the Australian people and the Australian government, I express my admiration to those who have been deployed. I know the families in Townsville, Randwick and also in Richmond will look forward to their loved ones - Defence personnel - returning to Australia.</DOC>

 - In answer to the last part of the question, certainly not the Australian Labor Party. The first point that needs to be cleared up here is that the contracts were not with Saddam Hussein; the contracts were with the United Nations oil for food program. - They had the responsibility to scrutinise every aspect of those contracts. On this issue of prices, it was not DFAT's responsibility to check the prices on the UN contracts; it was the UN's responsibility. The United Nations engaged professional operators to assess and establish whether price and value were credible. They scrutinised every contract with professional advisers on price and value. That was done by the UN. That is the answer to the member's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question and acknowledge the role he and the member for Braddon have played in efforts to restore and maintain rail services in Tasmania. This is obviously a very important issue for Tasmania. Honourable members will be aware that late last year Pacific National announced that they intended to close most of the freight services in Tasmania because they were uneconomic. To have moved all of the volume on those freight services onto road would have had significant implications for the Tasmanian road transport system, and, of course, all Tasmanians wanted to maintain effective rail services because of the important role they play in the state's infrastructure. Pacific National said that they needed major track upgrading and they needed a commitment from the Tasmanian government to maintain the track in the years ahead. In return they volunteered to provide $38 million to $40 million to upgrade engines and rolling stock.On 12 December the Australian government announced that we were prepared to participate in a rescue package for Tasmanian rail, contributing up to $86.75 million towards capital upgrading of the Tasmanian system so long as the other parties to the arrangement were prepared to also participate. Four days later the Tasmanian government indicated their willingness to participate, and now we are awaiting advice from Pacific National and are involved in negotiations with them to endeavour to secure the necessary funding from them to enable this package to proceed. There has been a constructive working relationship with the Tasmanian government, and I appreciate the role of the Tasmanian members of parliament in pursuing this issue and ensuring that we reach a satisfactory conclusion.Of course, the approach from members opposite was somewhat different. I thought it was quite extraordinary that the shadow minister for transport, the same Senator O'Brien that we were hearing about before, condemned the Australian government for offering this rescue package. He was acutely embarrassed when four days later the Tasmanian state Labor government accepted it and agreed to be part of the arrangements. We will get on with doing this job constructively. I understand that the board of Pacific National will be meeting later this month and I hope that that meeting may lead to a resolution of this issue and that Tasmanians can have the assurance they are looking for that their rail system will be sustainable in the years ahead.</DOC>

I am absolutely delighted to advise the House that the tourism figures that have been released today show that the number of international visitors coming to Australia is at an all-time high. Never before have so many international visitors come to Australia. In fact, 5½ million international visitors came to Australia in 2005. That is a 5.4 per cent increase on the previous year. I can further advise that key emerging markets such as China and India are performing very well indeed. These good results demonstrate that the very strong investment that this government is making into the tourism industry is really producing dividends. More than half a million Australians work directly in this industry, with more than 200,000 of them working in our regional areas. It is only this government that values and understands this important $73 billion industry.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question, for two reasons. Firstly, it enables me to point out to the parliament that, if the advice of the Leader of the Opposition had been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be financing suicide bombers. That is the first point I would make. - I will not apologise for that, because it is right. I will apologise for something that I say is wrong but not for something which is right. It was the policy of the Australian Labor Party not to support action to get rid of Saddam Hussein. - I will apologise for errors for which I am responsible. At no stage did this government ever condone the sort of behaviour alleged by the Leader of the Opposition. He asked me whether I could give a guarantee in relation to Australian money. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the money allegedly going to the Iraqi officials was not Australian money; it was in fact the money of Iraq held in escrow by the United Nations. If the allegations are true, it was improperly obtained by the Iraqi government as a result of the -  -  - While I am on my feet, I will take the opportunity to say something to the House by way of context not only to the questions that have been asked by the opposition but also to questions that will undoubtedly be asked over coming days. Let me just inform the Leader of the Opposition that all of the documents relevant to the matters now being inquired into by the Cole inquiry that are held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are in the possession of the Cole inquiry. Shortly after it was established, the Cole inquiry sent a group of people to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They were allowed to inspect all of the department's documents, and they took away copies of the documents that they wanted. - I thought he would be interested in this, Mr Speaker. I want to inform the parliament that not only does the Cole inquiry have all of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's documents; it has all of the relevant documents from my own department. It also crucially -  - I continue, Mr Speaker. Not only does Cole have all of the DFAT documents and all of the documents of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but crucially Cole has something that the government did not have and apparently, on the evidence to date, the United Nations did not have - that is, all of AWB Ltd's documents. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston, because he is one of the strong advocates in this place on the government side for Australian technical colleges. Of the 19 successful proposals announced so far in the 18 of the 24 regions the government promised, one is in the South Adelaide area. We are sure to make further announcements on at least two other regions in coming days. The government is spending $343.6 million over five years on this. Five are starting this year. In fact, four have already opened their doors in places such as eastern Melbourne, Gladstone, the Gold Coast and Port Macquarie. Another college will open up in northern Tasmania, in Burnie and Launceston. -  - Those opposite are calling out 'four' - yes, that is four colleges; the Labor Party promised zero. At the end of it, this government's commitment to vocational and technical education has seen funding increase by 88.3 per cent since 1996. In real terms, that is a record $2.5 billion this financial year compared to the measly $1.07 billion in 1995. The number of new apprentices in training has increased by 172 per cent, from 143,795 in 1995 to 391,200 as at the end of June last year. The member for Kingston will be interested to know that in his electorate 74 apprentices are eligible today for the Tools for your Trade initiative. The member for Brand would probably want to know - because he says he does not know of any - there are 218 in his electorate. In the member for Kingston's electorate there has been a 367 per cent increase in the number of apprentices in training since 1996.This is evidence that the Australian business community, who are the ones who create apprenticeships, are driving the economy further by taking that investment and are making certain that Australia's future and the future strength of our economy is assured by this investment in training. Government members - More! - You want more? 
Government members - Yes! - The number of students altogether in vocational and technical education around this country today has risen to 1.6 million people, and that is an increase of 26 per cent over the last few years. At the end of the day, never before in the history of this nation has there been a government with this level of commitment to this important area of encouraging businesses to take on young people in particular, to give them the training opportunities to take on the nation building trades. This is a big contrast to the days when the member for Brand was the minister in charge of this particular area. In fact, I suppose the Minister for Defence will probably like the irony of this. When the member for Brand went from Defence to education and training, he said that there were no challenges left. He felt as though there was nothing to do, and in his time in that particular job there were 30,000 people trashed when it came to apprenticeships in this country, and Australia's economy is still paying the price for the lack of interest that the member for Brand had when he had an opportunity to grow apprenticeships. Instead he retarded it, and it affected Australia's economy. The recession we had to have is still being felt right around Australia today because of the member for Brand's stewardship at that time.</DOC>

 - This Friday's meeting between the premiers and chief ministers and me will be a special opportunity for the governments of this country to make a number of important practical decisions that will improve the lives of Australians, not least Australians who live in Far North Queensland.The two most important issues to be discussed on Friday are areas of improved cooperation and investment in health, and also measures that are designed to break down absurd and outdated barriers in relation to skills, training and qualifications. I would call our health care and skills development the meat and potatoes proposals of this week's COAG meeting.The health reform package will have a number of very important elements in it, including better management of chronic disease, more support for cancer patients, better care for older patients in hospitals, measures to reduce the number of younger people with disabilities in nursing homes and better tailoring of rural health and community care programs to local needs.The Commonwealth will go to this meeting in absolute good faith, and I am optimistic that the states will reciprocate. In many of the health areas the Commonwealth is prepared to make a significant financial contribution, even in one area - that is, caring for younger people with disabilities - where the overwhelming responsibility, under agreements negotiated during the lifetime of the former federal government, lies with the states.As will be revealed on Friday, the Commonwealth is prepared to invest significant additional funds in all of these areas. We are prepared to address issues relating to nursing home type patients remaining in public hospitals, which has been a matter of continued criticism and concern from the states, justified or not. We will expect the states in return to match their responsibilities in a number of areas. The approach that I will be taking to Friday's meeting is simply this: it is not a question of apportioning blame or fault; it is a question of the two levels of government working together. That is what I hope will happen.Friday will not be a test, or a contest of wallets. It will be a test of goodwill on the part of the governments of Australia. Can I say in that context that there is no issue more absurd, particularly for people who live in Far North Queensland, for example, that we continue to have in Australia these ridiculous rail gauge problems when it comes to the recognition of trade qualifications across state boundaries. For example, I understand that you can get a hairdressing qualification in Western Australia and that you can carry on that occupation in England, but you cannot carry it on in some of the other states of Australia. I am pleased to tell the House that at an officials level there has been a great responses from the states to some practical proposals of the Commonwealth, and I am very optimistic that we are going to make progress.The final thing I want to say is that issues relating to longer term economic reform will also be on the agenda. I welcome the support, particularly of the Victorian Premier, Mr Bracks, that has been expressed for longer term economic reform. Can I say in relation to that that I have noticed in the media some suggestions coming from some of the states that the states will only be prepared to move further on economic reform if the Commonwealth pays them in advance for doing it. That is not a tenable proposition. The idea that any government should reform areas of their responsibility only if they are paid in advance to do it is of course an absurd proposition. If there are economic reforms in Australia, it is true that there are increased revenues for both the Commonwealth and the states. The increase in the Commonwealth revenues may be greater than that of the states - may be greater - but I remind the House that, when you look at the aggregate expenditures for the future, the liabilities of the Commonwealth are in turn also greater. It is therefore only logical that the gains from revenue should be proportionate to those greater responsibilities.I believe that with goodwill on both sides - and I will certainly take goodwill from the Commonwealth to this meeting - we can make some practical progress and that, out of this meeting at the end of this week, there will be real gains in areas that are of ongoing daily interest to the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition knows that these contracts are conducted under the auspices of the UN. The UN had to agree to the terms of the contracts and they had to agree to the payment being made out of the escrow account that they controlled. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question - and for a serious question about this issue. Let me make it clear that the relationship between Australia and the United States, which has been in the past ridiculed by the opposition, is a very strong and a very successful relationship. The Australian Ambassador to the United States, Dennis Richardson, met overnight with Senator Norm Coleman. The ambassador told Senator Coleman that Michael Thawley - Ambassador Richardson's predecessor - had made representations last year to Senator Coleman in good faith, and that he and Michael Thawley, the Australian government and indeed many others had at that time considered AWB Ltd to be an organisation of repute and integrity. There was no evidence to suggest wrongdoing at that time, as even the United States Wheat Associates had conceded in June 2003, and AWB Ltd had privately and publicly strenuously denied any allegations of wrongdoing. Indeed, Mr Richardson had received a similar message himself, as he told Senator Coleman, from AWB Ltd when he met them before taking up his post in June 2005.Senator Coleman subsequently issued a statement following the meeting. He said that Mr Richardson had addressed his concerns and reassured him on several counts, including that the Cole inquiry will be completely unfettered in its efforts to determine the truth behind the allegations that AWB Ltd paid illegal kickbacks to the Saddam Hussein regime, that the Australian government would cooperate fully with the Cole inquiry and that after the Cole inquiry was completed its evidence would be turned over to relevant law enforcement entities as appropriate. Senator Coleman finished up by saying that he was hopeful that this would strengthen the already strong US-Australian relationship.Some people, and I think we all know who they are here, think that Australia's reputation has been trashed in the United States and that our strong response is inadequate. As a matter of fact, some 66 countries were mentioned in the Volcker inquiry. Over 2,000 companies were found by Volcker to have been involved in paying kickbacks from 66 different countries. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only country of the 66 countries to have set up an inquiry of this kind. So I would have thought that the opposition, which has made some of the most preposterous allegations I have heard in 21 years, including the Leader of the Opposition claiming the Australian government is responsible for the killing of American soldiers -  - I would expect the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition more generally -  - And he defends that! The public will not thank you for making that type of a claim. The opposition should respect the Cole inquiry and let it go about its work in the normal way, instead of constantly prejudging the government, prejudging AWB Ltd and indeed making a series of comments which are utterly ill-informed.</DOC>

 - As I continue to say, the contracts were conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, the United Nations had to approve the terms of the contracts and the United Nations approved payments on the contracts.

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform the House that the consumer sentiment index released for the month of February showed a rise in consumer confidence of 1.8 per cent and that consumer sentiment now stands higher than it has since August last year, although at a more moderate level than in 2003-04. That is consistent with some slowing in consumer demand but a welcome adjustment in the most recent months to price increases such as the extraordinary increase in petrol prices with which Australian motorists have been afflicted. It is clear that strong consumer sentiment is underpinned by low unemployment, low inflation and stable and low interest rates. If we can keep inflation under control in the Australian economy, particularly if we can prevent second-round effects flowing from petrol prices, there are prospects to continue strong and steady growth throughout the course of the year. In its most recent survey on Australia, the OECD noted as follows:In the last decade of the 20th century, Australia became a model for other OECD countries in two respects: first, the tenacity and thoroughness with which deep structural reforms were proposed ... and second, the adoption of fiscal and monetary frameworks that emphasised transparency and accountability.The most recent Economic policy reforms: going for growth OECD report noted the progress that Australia has made even in the last year - progress in promoting employment of the low skilled, progress in reforming disability benefit schemes, progress in strengthening vocational education, progress in reducing marginal effective tax rates for low-income earners and progress in accelerating reforms in electricity, rail, gas and water industries. That was from the release overnight of the OECD report Economic policy reforms: going for growth. It showed that we are making progress in many of those areas where the Australian Labor Party is trying to block reforms, such as labour markets, disability pensions and the like. I must re-emphasise to the House and re-emphasise to the Australian public the importance of continuing the reform program. It is the reform program that got Australia to where it is today. It is the reform program of today which will get us to where we want to be tomorrow. These deep-seated reforms are what will drive jobs and productivity in the future, and that is why this government is committed to continuing with them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question on what is a very important issue not just to Australia's farmers but also to all Australia's exporters, including Australia's manufacturing exporters. At the end of last year we represented Australia at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting of the WTO, which includes the 150 member countries of the WTO. It was a very important meeting because the outcome was quite significant. The most important aspect of the outcome - and I know the member for Riverina is very keen to see this enacted - was a commitment by the European Union to end export subsidies by the year 2013. This outcome has been pursued by Australia, the Cairns Group and all the agricultural free-trading countries across the world for over 50 years. To achieve that commitment from the European Union is quite significant in ending what are the worst of all agricultural subsidies - that is, export subsidies and the way they distort in such a terrible way the markets of the world, not just affecting economies like Australia's but also dramatically affecting the developing countries of the world. It is very important to recognise that all the developing countries of the world are very interested in improving their market access to some of the wealthier countries.A classic example of the damage that export subsidies cause was the resultant outcome of a case that we took in the WTO over the last couple years on sugar export subsidies. Of course, we are seeing quite a buoyant market as far as the sugar industry across the world is concerned at the moment. That is very important, because for many years Australia's sugar producers have suffered greatly. We won this case against the European Union in the WTO. The result was that they had to take their export subsidies off four million tonnes of sugar. It is very important to our industry and our nation.We have set a timetable this year to agree the final outcomes in the round in terms of time frames and the formula for when other domestic support elements and other tariffs should be removed not just from agricultural products but from industrial goods and services. The meeting was very successful. Australia played a key role as a member of what is loosely called the G6 - a group of countries that are trying to lead the way to conclude this round. They are the United States, the European Union, India, Japan, Brazil and Australia. We continue to work through the course of this year to try and achieve an outcome, which we expect to do by the end of this year. But we should remember that Australia has led the debate on many of these issues for over 50 years, through governments of both political persuasions. To achieve the outcome that we did in Hong Kong was very good, and to get a commitment from the European Union to end export subsidies by 2013 was warmly welcomed not just by Australia's farmers or our exporters across the country but also by the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The first point is that we have established the Cole commission of inquiry to investigate all of these matters. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has outlined, we are the only country out of about 66 countries -  - I say again that all these matters are being canvassed within the Cole commission of inquiry. - The Labor Party keeps interrupting when I am trying to answer the question. I will state again that the Cole commission of inquiry has been established to get to the facts of the matter of this whole issue. That is currently part heard. We should be allowing the Cole commission of inquiry to complete its work and deliver its conclusions. As to the issue in the last part of the member for Griffith's question, I indicated before that it was quite a complex question on whom, where, when and what dates and what information. I said I would find out for him and I will find out for him and bring it back.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. Today, the government has announced that it will allocate another $305 million over the next six years to a multi-agency operation directed at bolstering enforcement of Australia's tax and financial laws against cross-border exploitation. The money will proceed under the codename Operation Wickenby. This cross-agency cooperation plan will involve the Taxation Office, the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.I am advised by the Commissioner of Taxation that, as a result of a joint investigation between the Taxation Office and the Australian Crime Commission, including the execution of search warrants and unannounced access visits in June 2005, information has been obtained about the promotion of and participation in tailored international tax schemes. These arrangements are alleged to have had at their heart attempts to create fictitious deductions or to conceal income.Operation Wickenby will be directed at enforcing a number of Australian laws. A wide range of sanctions will be applied, including confiscation of assets using proceeds of crime, criminal and summary prosecutions, actions for breaches of taxation laws and tax assessments. Where breaches of other laws are identified under Operation Wickenby, matters will be referred under law to the relevant agencies. I indicate that this additional funding of $305 million - a very substantive sum over a period of six years - is in addition to the normal funding for these agencies in relation to international matters and it indicates the seriousness with which the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies take this conduct. The resources will be directed at investigating and bringing it to an end and this indicates the seriousness with which it is viewed by the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I can inform him and the House that real wages in Australia under the Howard government have grown by some 15.6 per cent -  - 15.6 per cent, Prime Minister, which compares with only 1.2 per cent when the Labor Party was in government - 15.6 per cent compared to a miserly 1.2 per cent. This government, for the first time, has indexed pensions, including the old age pension and the sole parent pension, to male total average weekly earnings, so as real wages in Australia have increased so too have pensions.The member for Canning asked me a question about whether I was aware of any forecasts for growth in wages and pensions. In this context, I note a letter which was written by the Leader of the Opposition to pensioners in his electorate of Brand. It is a letter, written in November 2005, in which the Leader of the Opposition said, 'The Howard government's industrial relations changes will lead to lower increases in the minimum wage which will in turn bring down the male total average weekly earnings, thereby directly hitting the hip pockets of pensioners.' - He says yes. This is the letter which the Leader of the Opposition wrote to his pensioner constituents last year and which he confirms here in question time today. As I said at the time, this was just a scare tactic from Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Australian Labor Party. I came across another forecast recently about wages and pensions in Australia. It was one that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's letter, does rely on some economic modelling and that modelling is very interesting. What this forecast shows is that the wages growth, which is predicted in terms of weekly earnings over the next three years, for 2006-07 is 4.7 per cent; for 2007-08, 4.7 per cent; and for 2008-09, 4.7 per cent. Indeed, this document goes on and says:In a continued tight labour market with acute skill shortages, average weekly earnings will be dragged upwards ...Upwards. Then it concludes:This will drag the sole parent pension up with it.Who do you think was responsible for this economic modelling? Was it Treasury? No, it was not the Treasury. This is a document released on 6 January this year by none other than the member for Rankin, Dr Emerson. Talk about letting the cat out of the bag. This document was released by a man on the opposition benches who I believe has some economic expertise, at least more than the Leader of the Opposition. This confirms what I have said that the letter sent by the Leader of the Opposition last year was just a scare campaign. That has been proven by what the member for Rankin has said in this document. The thing that will be most important in the future, as it has been in the last 10 years, in terms of wages for ordinary Australians, and indeed pensions for those in receipt of pensions, is a strong economy in this country. Part of continuing a strong economy in this country is to ensure that we have a modern workplace relations system. That is what this government is about and that is what the opposition is objecting to. We will do what is needed to ensure that the Australian economy remains strong. The same cannot be said for the opposition.</DOC>

 - Obviously the member for Griffith has not seen the statement from DFAT yesterday, so I will read it to him.

 - I say to the member for Fairfax that there has been a lot of reaction to evidence given before the Cole inquiry, but one reaction that came from a Western Australian politician whose Christian name is Kim did catch my eye. It did not come from the better-known Western Australian politician with the Christian name Kim; it came from none other than the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Kim Chance, in the Western Australian Labor government - bearing in mind that he is agriculture minister in the largest wheat-exporting state of Australia. I think what he had to say is a piece of very good advice to everybody on both sides of the House. I will read what he had to say:If there has been corruption in the West Australian or in the Australian wheat industry and its marketing then I would be very disturbed - nobody can argue with that proposition - but let's wait until we hear from the Cole inquiry about what the situation really is rather than commenting on bits and pieces of evidence as they fall out of the inquiry.The reality is that the level of investigation and the measure of transparency displayed by the Australian government is greater than that of any government in the world. This government has subjected itself to an inquiry that no other government, according to my advice, has been willing to do. We have had these indignant comments from the Leader of the Opposition and from the member for Griffith that Cole cannot investigate these matters. That is wrong. It is wrong with a capital W. - If the member for Griffith takes pause for a moment and listens, I will read something that Mr Cole had to say in his statement last Friday. I invite everybody in this House to read this statement. This is what he had to say at paragraph 8:This means that this Inquiry will address and make findings regarding, at least, the following:the role of DFAT in the process of obtaining United Nations' approval of AWB wheat contracts within the United Nations Oil-for-food Programme ...In other words, Cole is looking at the behaviour of DFAT. Is any other government around the world doing that? No. Cole is looking at the role of DFAT. But let me go on. -  - I see the fingers pointing. I knew they would, and they did. - Cole then goes on to say:the knowledge of DFAT in relation to such contracts;what AWB told the Commonwealth - He uses the generic expression 'the Commonwealth'. He does not confine it to DFAT. He does not confine it to officials. He uses the generic expression 'the Commonwealth'. He goes on to say:whether the Commonwealth, and in particular DFAT - in other words, he is talking generally about every arm of the Commonwealth, including, of course, ministers - was informed of any knowledge AWB may be found to have had, regarding comments made by AWB to Alia. - He then goes on to say in paragraph 14 - and I commend a reading of this to everybody in the House and others who are interested in these proceedings:Accordingly, if, during the course of my inquiry, it appears to me that there might have been a breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law by the Commonwealth or any officer of the Commonwealth related to the subject matter of the terms of reference, I will approach the Attorney-General seeking a widening of the terms of reference to permit me to make such a finding.He then goes on to say this:That position has not been reached.In other words, this man is looking at everything and, unlike the opposition, unlike the government, Mr Cole has access at a level nobody else has. He has not only DFAT's documents. They went to DFAT when this inquiry started and copied all the documents that they wanted. This is the cover-up! We were accused by the Labor Party of covering up. That was their first charge. How are you covering up when you invite them into the bowels of DFAT and you give them all the documents? That is some cover-up! Not only has he done that but he has also got the relevant documents from my department. More importantly than his getting our documents, he has also got AWB's documents. We do not have AWB's documents. The only documents of AWB that we have are those of correspondence.In other words, you have the situation of an outstanding Australian lawyer, a person who had a very high reputation at the Sydney bar before he became a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who then served on the Court of Appeal in New South Wales, which arguably after the High Court of Australia is the most prestigious court in this country - he has all of those qualifications - who is acting completely independently of the government. He has access to everything and he is examining everything.In those circumstances, I think the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him ought to take the advice of their mate Kim Chance in Western Australia. He is a man of great stature and respect in the Australian community. He is a person who is highly regarded in the Australian Labor Party. I know they will not take his advice, because they cannot help themselves. But I think out there the Australian people will respond to this proposition. If you have an eminent lawyer who has all the documents, all the independence in the world and all the integrity in the world looking at them, I think the Australian people are more likely to believe him than the member for Griffith.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Again, this is a matter that is being dealt with by the commission - and you know that. It has just been very clearly outlined. Commissioner Cole indicated quite clearly last Friday that he intends pursuing the matter.I refer the Leader of the Opposition, again, to the statement by DFAT yesterday where they said:DFAT did not approve the Tigris donation/debt repayment deal. DFAT's advice has been clear and consistent with the UN Sanctions regime. - Further to the question and to the statement by DFAT yesterday, I have been advised that, having searched the files, DFAT has no record of any knowledge of the complicated arrangements to inflate wheat contract prices to enable the repayment of the Tigris debt and wheat compensation payments. I am advised that it was aware in 1995 that BHP had funded a shipment of AWB wheat as a humanitarian donation. However, when BHP and AWB proposed that the donation be repaid under a credit agreement, DFAT advised this would violate sanctions. DFAT also emphasised that any changes to the original UN agreement would require sanctions committee approval. This fact has been reported to the Cole inquiry - the point that we continue to make to the Leader of the Opposition. DFAT's advice was clear and consistent with the UN sanctions regime, and DFAT has no record or any knowledge that the Tigris, BHP, AWB deal actually went ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He has shown a lot of interest in this issue, and he has been a lot of help, too, to the Australian government in making this possible. I know that the people of Darwin appreciate the excellent work that he has done, or they should do. It is called the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea. That treaty was signed by me and Jose Ramos-Horta, the East Timorese foreign minister, on 12 January in Sydney in the presence of the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of East Timor, Mari Alkatiri.This is a good agreement for Australia, and this is a good agreement for East Timor. With the 2003 International Unitisation Agreement, this creates a legal and fiscal regime which will underpin the development of the Greater Sunrise gas and oil field. It splits the upstream revenue derived from Greater Sunrise equally between Australia and East Timor, raising East Timor's share of the revenues from 18 per cent to 50 per cent, which could lead to additional revenue of up to $5 billion for East Timor over the life of the project. From Australia's point of view, it suspends maritime claims in the Timor Sea for 50 years.I think this very clearly reflects a commitment by Australia to promote the development and economic prosperity of one of our closest neighbours, but it also supports Australia's interests. As Prime Minister Alkatiri said at the signing ceremony, 'The agreement is a very positive agreement for East Timor,' and of course I say the agreement is a very positive one for Australia.At the last election the then member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, said that, if he was elected - and the opposition of course asked the Australian people to elect Mark Latham as the Prime Minister - he would recommence the negotiating process. Labor wanted to unscramble the whole of this process and start all over again. It might not be the most important reason for people re-electing this government at the last election - there may be a range of other issues - but it simply illustrates the point that they made a very wise decision.</DOC>

 - I can assure the member for Braddon that, while members opposite engage in an endless scandal hunt and fishing expeditions, the Howard government is delivering better health services for the people of Australia. The government believes that health call centres are useful and important supplements to existing health services. I want to make it very clear that these are an addition to existing services, not a substitute for them. Health call centres mean that worried people can receive expert advice round the clock on whether they need to attend an emergency department, whether they should see their doctor or whether they can seek other forms of treatment. The centres can provide up-to-date information on where these services are available.So far, the government has provided $9 million to support Tasmanian GP Assist, which includes a health call centre. We have provided $21 million to the Hunter after-hours service, which also includes a health call centre. We have provided $3 million to help set up the state-wide Western Australia health call centre, which has been operating since 2001. This week the Council of Australian Governments will consider whether there should be a national health call centre, whether a particular model should be adopted and whether all existing call centres can continue to operate concurrently with a national centre. The member for Lalor greeted this announcement with her usual carping negativity. But the Howard government is prepared to work constructively with the states on this matter, which just goes to show that the Australian people trust the Howard government with their health, and it shows that the Howard government remains, most assuredly, the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I do appreciate the question that the member for Kennedy has asked. I think he makes a number of very telling points about the behaviour of the Beattie government. I do commend the concerns that he has - concerns which he shares with the member for Leichhardt, the member for Herbert and many others in this place - about improving health services and medical services in North Queensland. I can inform him that, under this government, the James Cook University medical school was established. Under this government, in 2004, the numbers of medical students at James Cook were increased. I was delighted just recently to go to the graduation of the first class of medical students from that fine school at that fine university.I take on board the points which the member for Kennedy has made. I think I can assure him and other people concerned about this issue that this government is always looking at ways to increase our medical workforce. Certainly his representations - as well as the representations by the members for Leichhardt and Herbert - will be taken into account as long as the government continues to make decisions in respect of the medical workforce to the great benefit of the people of Far North Queensland.</DOC>

The member for Leichhardt has been a persistent advocate of more being done by both the Commonwealth and the states in this area which is of such vital concern to the daily lives of millions of Australians.The Mental Health Council report Not for service released last October noted the likelihood that every family in Australia will be affected by mental health problems at some stage. It made the point that it should no longer remain a marginal health issue. The report noted, incidentally, that in the last nine years the Commonwealth funding commitment to mental health had risen by 128 per cent. But, despite this, there remain many challenges and systemic weaknesses in the area, including the need to get the balance right between hospital care, community care and the best type of accommodation for people who cannot manage on their own.In November, I wrote to all the premiers and chief ministers on the need for a more coordinated approach. We will be discussing this matter and our shared responsibility - and I stress that: our shared responsibility - at the meeting here in Canberra tomorrow. The states of Australia have a responsibility to devote more resources to mental health; so does the Commonwealth. I note in particular and I welcome the fact that the New South Wales Premier has indicated his commitment to make this a priority. I would be very surprised if the other premiers and the chief ministers did not adopt a similar attitude.Three per cent of Australians have a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychotic disorders or suffer from severe depression. About 20 per cent of Australians suffer some form of mental illness over any 12-month period. This is a problem that, as a society, we have not handled well in the past. Until the 1960s we had a policy of treating mental illness through a process of institutionalisation. That changed largely under the impetus of the Richmond inquiry in New South Wales, and the change gathered pace through the 1980s and 1990s. There is abundant evidence that that process went too far. Whilst I do not advocate, and I do not believe Australia would benefit from, turning back the clock to the institutions of old, nor can we as a decent society tolerate having people with mental illnesses out in the community unsupported and untreated.I also believe that we are paying a very heavy price in terms of mental illness from the abuse of illicit drugs such as marijuana over the years. The tolerant and absurdly compromised attitudes of many on the use of those drugs are now a classic case of the chicken coming home to roost. I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of so-called recreational and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things are doing massive damage within our community.Greater focus on prevention and early detection must be part of a more comprehensive mental health strategy. We also need a better understanding of the medical workforce needed to support and treat people - for example, by looking at the role of psychologists and other health professionals. We need to look at supporting people with mental illness on a day-to-day basis - at home, through education, training and assistance into employment, as well as with the medical treatment that they need - and supporting their families and training others in the community who are in the front line dealing with the problems of mental illness.I want to say on behalf of the Commonwealth that we will play our part. We will make an additional commitment of resources. We will do our bit, but we cannot do it alone. The states have ongoing important institutional responsibilities in this area. I want this matter dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I want all of the heads of government of this country to understand it is a serious issue and the Australian public will expect no less than a coordinated, genuine commitment by all of us to try and solve the problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its labour force survey for January today, which showed that employment increased by 1,800 persons in January and has increased now by 159,400 persons through the year. Interestingly, full-time employment rose by 30,500 persons but part-time employment fell by 28,700. Notwithstanding the rise in employment, the unemployment rate edged up marginally to 5.3 per cent in January. This is consistent with some of the surveys that we have seen such as the ANZ job ads survey and the ABS skill vacancies. The rate of job creation in the economy has been slowing in recent months compared to the very fast rises that we had through 2003 and 2004.The point that I have also made in relation to this is that we cannot rely on the cycle to generate continued reductions in the unemployment rate. We are probably at a cyclical low in relation to unemployment after the strong growth that we have had through many years. If we want to make further inroads into unemployment in this country, now we must deal with structural barriers in the labour market and in particular the most important structural barrier in the labour market - that is, improvement of Australia's labour relations system and industrial relations reform. These reforms will generate increased productivity, they will give more people opportunity, they will give flexibility to the work force and they will empower Australia to become a much more open and flexible economy. These are the reforms which the government has been battling over for years and years to get in place. The legislation has finally gone through the Senate.That is not the end of this process. It is the beginning of this process. Those laws are yet to take effect and they are yet to be used by Australian businesses. We would certainly recommend that Australian businesses carefully consider them and carefully consider the way in which they can improve productivity and employment outcomes.It is worth noting, as we come up to the 10th anniversary of this government in March 2006 that since the government was elected there have created in the Australian economy 1.7 million new jobs. That is, 1.7 million more people are in work today than when the Labor Party left office. It has been a strong decade, but there is more work to go.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I know the member for Hinkler has a number of manufacturing industries in his area that are doing very well from exports - companies like Jabiru, AusChilli and Bundaberg Brewed Drinks. Bundaberg Brewed Drinks are selling brewed drinks to New Zealand, South Africa and other countries. They are adding to the effort that is being put in by Australian exporters, who last year achieved a record level of exports out of Australia. An amount of $176.7 billion worth of exports went out of Australia last year, which was a 15 per cent increase on 2004. A lot of those exports came out of the electorate of the member for Hinkler. There has been a significant change in the structure of the industries in that area. The horticultural industry is taking over from the sugar industry in his area.Under strong coalition policies we have seen record exports in six out of the last 10 years. Historic free trade agreements with the United States, Thailand and Singapore have helped along the way in opening up markets and providing opportunities for Australia's exporters, such as those in the electorate of Hinkler. By way of example, merchandise exports to Thailand hit a new record in 2005 of $4.1 billion. -  - I can see that the members of the Labor Party are very interested in these statistics! I can tell you that a lot of their constituents are very interested as well. Eight of the top 25 merchandise exports to the United States reached record levels in 2005, and 14 of the top 25 merchandise exports to Thailand reached record levels in 2005. Export of products like aluminium, medicines and motor vehicle parts, which are manufactured in all states of Australia but particularly in Victoria and South Australia, increased to Thailand after we halved the tariffs as a result of the free trade agreement we negotiated with Thailand.Australia's exporters are taking advantage of the opportunities being created by our government. We will continue to work with them. We will continue to work with the job creators in our economy.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member and I appreciate the interest he has in climate change, which is certainly an issue we on this side of the House take very seriously. Members on this side of the House will be interested to know that the inaugural meeting of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, as it is called, which is abbreviated to AP6, was held in Sydney on 12 January. This was a ministerial meeting of ministers from Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and the United States of America.The partners in AP6 share the objective of dealing with the problem of greenhouse emissions while at the same time trying to maintain economic growth. I think this is a very important point for people to understand. With such a large number of people around the world living in poverty, we regard it as essential that efforts be made to bring those people out of poverty through economic growth. Yet that has to be achieved at the same time as ensuring that efforts are made to mitigate the effects of the greenhouse emissions.The AP6 initiative brought together half of the global GDP and represents around half of the world's population and, for that matter, around half of the greenhouse emissions. All partners have now committed resources under the partnership to supporting task forces made up of the private as well as the public sectors from each of these countries to work out solutions which will not only improve economic growth prospects for the relevant countries but also address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and help to reduce the impact of those emissions on climate change.Are there any alternative views? The Labor Party has several alternative views. The member for Jagajaga and the member for Grayndler attacked the AP6 initiative. They thought it was not a good idea to bring together countries like China, India and the United States, none of which have targets under the Kyoto protocol, and work out ways that those countries can address the climate change issue. It seems to me quite an extraordinary and incredible point of view. But not all people in the Labor Party have such curious views. The member for Batman, for example, who I think is maturing very well in this place, praised AP6, and I praise him for praising AP6. - No, you make good, funny jokes and you are a good man. He praised AP6 and said that it not only offered Australia an opportunity for economic growth but also 'allows us to be part of the solution to the environmental consequences of what is happening in our region'. Exactly! Perfectly put; beautifully put! So if the Leader of the Opposition had any ticker he would admit that Kyoto was insufficient to deal with the problem of climate change. He would have an initiative that would support AP6. He would have things to say about it. He would ask questions in parliament about it. He would generate public debate about it instead of concentrating on trivial questions about matters that are being considered in other fora.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calare for his question. Obviously, these matters will be progressed by the department as quickly and as expeditiously as possible, but I would make this point about the handling of these matters. I have noted the efforts of some to ensure that the identifying of those who have come to Australia before claims have been dealt with, properly and appropriately in accordance with law, has been allowed to occur. One of the problems I have with matters of that sort is that, under the international conventions that we are a party to, claims which are sur place - that is, claims that are made in the media unrelated to any possible persecution - do not give rise to an asylum claim. People have been left exposed, I think, by the way in which this issue has been attempted to be used by some. These decisions should be dealt with appropriately by the department and properly in accordance with law.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Fairfax for his question, and I note that he has every right to be anxious about the state of Queensland public hospitals, both as a local member and as the chairman of the House's Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. I can inform him and other members that Queensland will receive more than $8 billion from the Commonwealth under the current health care agreement. In addition, Queensland is receiving almost $8 billion a year thanks to the GST. But despite these rivers of gold, the Beattie government is chronically underfunding the public hospital system of Queensland. Its spending per head is 25 per cent less than the average spending of the other states. If you do not spend the money, you do not get the services - and the Dr Death inquiry has revealed woefully inadequate procedures for vetting overseas medical qualifications, routine intimidation of staff who question management decisions and habitual deceit about issues such as waiting lists which turned out to be three times greater than publicly claimed.Last month the Caboolture hospital emergency department was forced to close, and this means that 150,000 people in one of the fastest growing areas of Queensland do not have ready access to emergency department services. On the very day it closed there was a fatal accident less than 250 metres from this hospital and those people were denied ready access to emergency department services. Last year 200 patients presented at that emergency department who needed immediate attention, 3,000 patients presented at that emergency department who needed attention within 10 minutes and more than 10,000 patients presented there who needed attention within 30 minutes. Most of these people will now be forced to go to Redcliffe, which is up to 40 minutes away by car. Of course, it is possible that they might be able to go by ambulance except that Queensland's emergency controllers are now dispatching fire engines - fire engines! - to accident victims because there are no longer enough ambulances in Queensland.What is Premier Beattie doing about this? Today we see more advertisements claiming that it is all the federal government's fault, even though the number of federally funded, first-year medical student places in Queensland has almost doubled since 1996. I think this parliament should send a very clear message to Premier Beattie: start fixing this mess now; stop telling lies about the federal government to try to save your own political skin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and note the great representation that she is providing to people in Greenway, in the western suburbs of Sydney. She asked me about registered organisations, and of course some of the most significant registered organisations in Australia are trade unions. Last week it was revealed by the Australian Electoral Commission that the unions in Australia have donated to the Australian Labor Party since 1996 some $50 million. I was interested in that in light of some remarks that have been made about the activities of these registered organisations, particularly in relation to the Australian Labor Party, to which they have donated some $50 million. Indeed, there was a program on radio on the weekend Background Briefing, whose transcript I commend all honourable members to read because there are a number of quite significant comments made during the course of that program.First of all, we had a former minister from the Wran government of New South Wales, Mr Rodney Cavalier. When commenting on the Australian Labor Party, he said:The central problem with the Labor Party is that it is controlled lock, stock and barrel by trade unions. 100 percent of management power is in the hands of union leaders and their clients.That is what he says they bought for their $50 million. There were other comments. The opposition are making a lot of noise because they do not want to hear this. We had a New South Wales Labor official, Assistant Secretary Mr Luke Foley, who himself had been a trade union boss in New South Wales. Amongst other things, he said:At the moment, it is really only union secretaries who wield power through the carrying of block voters at Labor Party conferences.He is basically saying that the ordinary members no longer have a say and no longer have a vote. Then we had Mr Peter Botsman, who said:What I know is that the Australian Labor Party is not democratic. - I will repeat what Mr Botsman was saying:What I know is that the Australian Labor Party is not democratic, absolutely tyrannical in the way in which it runs its administrative apparatus, and as a result the Labor Party is out of touch, issues don't matter, ideas don't matter, the fate and future of the country don't matter.He summed up the modern Australian Labor Party under the leadership of the member for Brand - the man who in the same interview conceded six months ago that they would lose the next election. What this shows is no membership -  -  - This transcript shows, from voices of the Labor Party in Australia, that it has no membership, no ideas, no policies and no leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At the outset, let me say that I have not misled the House. The Wheat Export Authority, on the basis of newspaper reports, initiated their own inquiries of AWBI in February 2004. Over a period of time they sought information and examined documents and then in August 2004 attended the offices of AWBI and looked at 17 specific contracts between AWB and Iraq. They were acting under their legislative responsibilities. When they heard of the kickback rumours - no evidence was presented - they initiated their own inquiries. They were clearly and repeatedly told by AWB that there were no improprieties in regard to the contracts that the WEA investigated. From the information provided to the WEA, and to their best abilities, they found, to quote their chairman, 'Nothing untoward'. The WEA has provided all relevant papers and correspondence on these issues to the Cole inquiry, and I suggest that we allow the inquiry to do its job.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question because I know that he, like many members of this House, is vitally interested in the implementation of substantial family law reforms. On 8 December I introduced a bill into this House containing the most significant changes to family law in over 30 years. It was derived from valuable work that had been undertaken in this chamber by committees - the first chaired by the honourable member for Riverina and the second by the honourable member for Fisher - proposing reform in this area. I regarded both of those reports very highly and have been pleased to see substantial implementation of the recommendations contained in them.I am keen to see the support of the sort that we saw in the results of the two committees - bipartisan support for these measures - but I notice that, notwithstanding the substantial agreement, there was not total agreement to those measures. The member for Gellibrand, the shadow attorney, for example, had a different view to some of her colleagues in relation to those matters when they were dealt with in the excellent report from the House committee. She did say that she was going to spend the summer break going through the bill line by line. I am pleased to see the member for Gellibrand back from her summer break and, after the 63 days that she has had to go through the bill line by line, I am still waiting to hear the result of all that effort.I know sometimes we have to wait for these contributions. I know that one of her colleagues, Senator Hogg, who was asked to comment on these matters recently told a constituent that Labor is working on its policy, which will be released before the next election. I hope we do not have to wait that long. I also hope it is not an indication of where the Labor Party stands that, after the two largely bipartisan reports, extensive consultation and public submissions, the Labor Party has facilitated a further committee review in the Senate which will not report until next March. This means that thousands of mothers, fathers, grandparents and friends who support the reforms and want certainty in the new arrangements and who certainly do not want to see these measures delayed will see such a delay facilitated by this further Senate review. There are thousands of children who deserve better outcomes when their parents separate. This government wants to get on with the job of improving our family law system and wants to get it done expeditiously.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did not mislead the House. I believe the answer to his question lies in the letter from the Chairman of the WEA to Senator Heffernan, as Chairman of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Estimates Committee, which is dated 7 February:When questioned specifically by WEA staff over the provision of 'kickbacks' in Iraq AWB(I) denied any wrong. AWB(I) staff pointed to the unique circumstances of Iraq sales (eg: that sales were to include delivery of wheat over land and payment is not made until the wheat is delivered) to explain why it was necessary to pay a Jordanian trucking company and why prices may appear above global benchmarks.Whilst we are talking about statements from last night, I notice your statements and your doorstop talks about how this is the smoking gun. - If it will help the honourable member understand the role of the WEA, they look at land transport costs to free on board, because they are costs borne by wheat growers - in other words, they are a cost to the national pool. But in the normal course of events they do not look at land transport costs offshore because of the assurances they have received in the past that they are borne by the customer and therefore are not a draw on the national pool and are not within their charter. But they made an exception. To their full credit, they made an exception to this practice and to these responsibilities when in August 2004, on the basis of public newspaper reports, they made inquiries about land transport costs in the event that those costs were being borne by wheat growers. So it is a very simple thing. Let us talk about last night. Last night this was the smoking gun. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition says there is no smoking gun.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for asking me a question about this issue. I appreciate her interest in asking me a question. Let me begin answering these claims by making a simple point: if Saddam Hussein's regime had remained in power, the oil for food program would have continued and the corruption of the oil for food program would have remained undiscovered. -  - The corruption would be continuing undiscovered if the Labor Party had had its way. Let me just make that point. It was the work of the coalition provisional authority, it was the work that was done to expose what Saddam Hussein's regime had been doing through access to the documents of that regime and interviews with people in that regime that made it possible to establish the corruption in the oil for food program. There was the establishment of the Volcker committee and its report and ultimately the establishment in this country of the Cole commission. - The second point is that the opposition - the Leader of the Opposition in particular - has accused the Prime Minister, ministers, officials of various government departments and diplomats in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of being corrupt. Not morally corrupt. He said, 'No, they were corrupt, period.' According to the Leader of the Opposition, 'This is the worst piece of corruption I have seen in 25 years as a federal politician.' I have often reflected on this. If I were so corrupt, why would you ask 28 questions and not one to a person who is apparently corrupt? Let me make this point: more abhorrently, the Leader of the Opposition has accused the Australian government of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of American soldiers in Iraq and of funding Palestinian suicide bombers and he takes a point of order about weapons of mass destruction -  - but on the Lateline program on Monday night, the Leader of the Opposition said that this money was responsible for funding Saddam Hussein's research into weapons of mass destruction. So at least we get the concession from the Leader of the Opposition that Saddam Hussein was doing research into weapons of mass destruction. These are profoundly serious allegations to make against the Australian government - The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - What is interesting is that, as we come to the end of this parliamentary week, no evidence has been produced at all to support these extraordinary, extremist and hyperbolic assertions. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said to the National Press Club:...I promise you - the people at the National Press Club are journalists - and every Australian - this - will be the most aggressive Parliamentary interrogation this Government has faced in its ten long years in office.You can just imagine him saying it, all blown up, explosive and excited: 'The worst corruption in 25 years', 'Responsible for the deaths of Americans', 'Suicide bombers', 'Research into weapons of mass destruction', yet after a whole week of these incredible assertions the Leader of the Opposition today was quoted on Brisbane ABC news as saying:There is no smoking gun here.Oh dear! The most corrupt, appalling, vile, cruel, wicked people in the history of the universe - but there is unfortunately no smoking gun. The Leader of the Opposition, at the end of the day, is a weak man who is a pathetic parliamentary performer.</DOC>

 - There is absolutely no difference between the comments that have been made by me and the comments made by the new minister for agriculture. What the minister for agriculture has clearly pointed out is that the Wheat Export Authority exercised its legislative responsibility to investigate allegations that were in the public domain. It reported on these matters in the confidential report to the minister, which I received in October 2004. Whilst the report is confidential, Mr Besley, the chairman of the authority, has said a couple of things about what was in that report. The first the minister for agriculture commented about a couple of minutes ago in his letter to Senator Heffernan in which he made the comment and referred to his statements in front of the Senate estimates committee that nothing untoward emerged from that check. To quote from Mr Besley, in the newspaper today, he said:The information given to the minister - and in this instance it was me - contained no evidence of wrongdoing. Instead, the minister was told the WEA had given AWB a 'clean bill of health'.So the advice given by the WEA to the minister was that the AWB had a clean bill of health on these issues. I believe the response that was made at that time was entirely appropriate. It dealt with the complaints, it dealt with the allegations and advised the minister that the AWB had a clean bill of health.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and I acknowledge her deep interest in opportunities for school leavers in her electorate. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that the latest data in relation to main round offers for school leavers of university places has increased across the nation by 4.4 per cent over last year. Across the nation states vary, but some of the stand-out increases in offers for university places for school leavers include seven per cent in Western Australia; over 8½ per cent in Queensland; and, the honourable member will be delighted to know, over 10½ per cent in South Australia and the Northern Territory.In this year alone there are an additional 18,500 Commonwealth supported places in the higher education sector. That will rise to some 39,000 places by 2009. These places are all part of the Howard government's Backing Australia's Future reform initiative that will see an additional $11 billion invested in the higher education sector over the next decade.In coming to this portfolio I must say that I just cannot understand how the Labor opposition voted against the Backing Australia's Future program. They voted against it, essentially saying to students, 'You shouldn't have access to $400 million in scholarships,' saying to universities, 'You shouldn't have access to an extra $354 million to reward learning and teaching excellence,' and saying to regional universities, 'You shouldn't have access to an extra $145 million.' The Howard government is committed to the future of school leavers by providing more Commonwealth supported university places, more training and apprenticeship opportunities and more employment opportunities.</DOC>

Since the evidence of Mr Besley, the Chairman of the WEA, to the Senate estimates on 1 November the shadow minister for agriculture has issued six press releases on this issue. He rushes up to the gallery close to deadline time last night and says, 'Here's a smoking gun.'

Let me also remind the Leader of the Opposition that way back in 1989 - and I wonder who was the Prime Minister then, and who was a senior minister - there was a decision taken by the cabinet that officials in an entire department could not answer any questions on a subject called 'Coronation Hill', not because there was a royal commission into Coronation Hill but simply because the matter was subject to cabinet consideration.Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition and, through him, the Australian people that we have a commission with royal commission powers looking into every aspect of this matter, and it is entirely appropriate that public servants be allowed to appear before that commission. They will be allowed; they will not be hindered. The decision taken by the government, by the cabinet, is entirely proper and indeed not out of line with the spirit of decisions taken by the former government of which the gentleman who has just asked me the question was a senior member.</DOC>

 - First of all can I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The Australian government welcomes the certification on 10 February of the final election results coming from Iraq's general election on 15 December. I congratulate all those who have been elected to what is called the Council of Representatives. What is particularly significant here is that the turnout in this election was 70 per cent. This was of course a voluntary election. In the face of the intimidation of the insurgents and the terrorists - in spite of all of that - there was a massive turnout. Now it is up to the elected representatives to work together to form a broadly representative government. The first meeting of the Council of Representatives will elect a speaker and deputy speakers, and then it will elect a president and vice-president, with a two-thirds majority. The president and vice-president will call for nominees for the position of prime minister. The United Iraqi Alliance has already voted. It voted yesterday for the current interim prime minister, Prime Minister Jafari, to be their candidate, having defeated the vice-president, Mahdi, 64 to 63, I think, with two abstentions.Obviously the new Iraqi government will have tough challenges. But the point is that this is a government which will have democratic legitimacy, where the ordinary people of Iraq, in the face of the insurgents, in the face of the terrorists, have gone out to vote and to support the whole process of democracy. It simply underlines the point that it is important that we in this country stand by the people of Iraq and the democratically elected parliament of Iraq and that this parliament stand by its democratic counterpart in Iraq. I cannot think of anything, in relation to Iraq, more important for us to do.The opposition's position is that we should support democracy in Afghanistan but we should abandon democracy in Iraq. I do not know about any of my colleagues here, but if they can see the logic of that I do not think anyone else can. There is no logic in supporting democracy in Afghanistan and simultaneously abandoning democracy in Iraq - except, of course, a view that: 'Iraq is not very popular, so let's abandon the less popular one and support the more popular one.' Only a weak leader of a political party would do that.</DOC>

 - I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that if I had anything to hide I would not have established the royal commission. It is as simple as that. The Leader of the Opposition gets very worked up, but let me just calmly remind the House of this. Let me read from the terms of reference. I read these terms of reference advisedly: 'It necessarily follows that the knowledge of the Commonwealth' - and 'the Commonwealth' there is used generically, so that includes me, it includes all of my colleagues, it includes public servants and it includes the secretary of the department - 'of any relevant fact is a matter to be addressed by this inquiry.'That is Mr Cole. Could I let the Leader of the Opposition into a secret: I think the Australian public will place more reliance on Mr Cole's findings than on the Leader of the Opposition's fulminations. We will leave that to later on. Continuing to read from the terms of reference:It necessarily follows that the knowledge of the Commonwealth of any relevant facts is a matter to be addressed by this inquiry and is within the existing terms of reference in the letters patent.That is what Mr Cole said. That is not John Howard, Alexander Downer or Mark Vaile. - I return to the point that the commissioner himself has said that it:... follows that the knowledge of the Commonwealth of any relevant facts is a matter to be addressed by this inquiry and is within the existing terms of reference in the letters patent.He then goes on to say that, if he needs any further power, he will ask for it. The Leader of the Opposition asks why we did not draw the terms of reference differently. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that we decided to establish this inquiry. - We established this inquiry because Volcker had made an adverse finding about AWB Ltd and other companies; he did not make an adverse finding about the Australian government. If he had, then the terms of reference would have gone further than they have. Our terms of reference do exactly what Volcker asked be done. In fact, almost alone amongst the countries around the world, we are having a proper inquiry into this matter. We have not referred it to the police, where you would not have the capacity to compel the attendance of witnesses and you would not have an open inquiry. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that this government has been utterly transparent in this matter - utterly transparent. We have established a commissioner with the powers of a royal commission, who can compel witnesses. As I said yesterday when being interviewed on television, I am content to let the blame fall where it may. This government has nothing to hide in relation to this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. The member for Riverina is well aware of many of the distortions in terms of global trade that our farmers face. In light of recent debate, it is important to remember that they face an unlevel playing field internationally. For decades and decades, Australian governments have been pursuing a better and fairer set of trading circumstances across the world. Australian farmers are amongst the best in the world, Mr Speaker, as you would be well aware. We are leading exporters of wheat, beef, wine, wool and sugar - and also of rice from the electorate of the member for Riverina. But they all face enormously unfair competition, once they venture out in the global marketplace.It is a well-known fact that governments around the world spend about $US280 billion per year subsidising their farmers, making it unfair or creating unfair competition against ours. Farmers in the European Union receive about 33 per cent of their income from government, while the US figure is about 18 per cent. So 18 per cent of farm-gate income in the United States comes from the government; 33 per cent in the European Union. It is interesting, again in the context of the current debate, that the top four executives of the US Wheat Associates received almost $2.5 million in subsidies. They are subsidies that Australian farmers - Australian wheat growers and Australian rice growers - do not have access to and have to compete against in markets across the world. That protectionism depresses prices and leads to lower returns.Our farmers also - this will be of interest to the member for Riverina - face incredibly high tariff barriers in terms of getting access to some markets. The member for Riverina would know of the 700 per cent tariff that our rice is confronted with going into Japan. Recently we have been criticised as a country and as a government by farm groups, like US Wheat Associates, for some of our domestic policies like the single desk. Given the figures that I have just mentioned, getting that sort of lecture from them is a little like taking anger management advice from Mark Latham.As Chair of the Cairns Group, we have worked for many decades to remove the unfairness of export subsidies. In Hong Kong, at the end of last year, we finally got agreement from the European Union to eliminate export subsidies by 2013. We aim to continue to fight to improve global trading circumstances so that our farmers, our exporters - particularly our wheat exporters - do not face the distortions that they currently do.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that I gave instructions that there should be total cooperation by the government with the Volcker inquiry. I also might add that I asked the relevant minister to write in unequivocal terms to AWB Ltd to indicate that AWB Ltd should cooperate fully with the Volcker inquiry. - I simply repeat that I instructed that there be cooperation, and I am sure the government cooperated fully with Volcker. The point I made in relation to the establishment of the royal commission was a very simple one: that Volcker made a finding adverse to AWB Ltd and a number of companies; he did not make a finding adverse to the government. The proposition that you just gratuitously establish royal commissions into the behaviour of people against whom nothing has been alleged - the Leader of the Opposition -  - I conclude my answer by simply saying that I have listened very carefully to the Leader of the Opposition. I watched a replay of his interview yesterday and - can I tell you something, Mr Speaker? - after all this noise, the Leader of the Opposition has provided no evidence to support the baseless allegations he has made against my ministerial colleague and against the government. I repeat that we have a royal commission into this matter. It is open, it is transparent and it is independent. It will get to the bottom of the matter, notwithstanding the fulmination of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that the current expansion of the Australian economy is longer than any other expansion that Australia has ever recorded. Unlike other countries that have had downturns in recent times, including the United States, Japan and much of Europe, the Australian economy has continued to grow. At the moment the economy is rebalancing somewhat. It was led, in recent years particularly, by consumption, but we are seeing a slowing in relation to consumption and hopefully a pick-up in relation to Australia's external trade. This of course is being led by the emergence of China and India, and the emergence of China and India has also led to very strong prices for energy and commodities.Notwithstanding all of that, the terms of trade increase that this has brought about could well be a difficulty for the Australian economy. In the past, every time there has been a terms of trade boom, inflation has got away in the Australian economy and it has invariably been balanced by a very severe downturn. So the task of managing the economy at the moment includes managing a terms of trade boom to ensure that it does not end badly, as it has on previous occasions.In a statement on the conduct of monetary policy which was released today, the Reserve Bank also underlined an assessment which is very similar to the government's assessment of the Australian economy. It noted that, given the current level of oil prices, headline inflation would remain close to three per cent in the short term. But it is important that we make sure that the increase in petrol prices does not have second-round effects and does not come back into the general economy, because, if it did, that would put pressure on monetary policy. Notwithstanding all these challenges, Australia is set for continuing growth on low inflation with a very strong budget position, which is important to maintain our present discipline.I was rather interested in an unexpected endorsement of economic policy last week from the new Premier of Western Australia, Mr Alan Carpenter, who noted the growth of the national economy. He noted the low unemployment and said, 'The GST, which I opposed, has been in the interests of the country.' I thought that was a very interesting observation from the new Labor Premier of Western Australia. I do not think I have ever heard anybody in the federal Labor Party turn around and say that the GST was in the interests of the Australian economy. The last-known word from the Leader of the Opposition on the GST was a word which began with 'R', the word which dare not speak its name. As for the member for Hotham, he made a career out of opposing the GST. He is not here today; he is no doubt back home saving his preselection - and well he might. He would enjoy a bit of support from the Leader of the Opposition when it came to saving his preselection.I want to place on record that we are standing with the member for Hotham, the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Corio against the factional forces down there in Victoria which are going to roll each and every one of them out. We appreciate you even if the factional bosses of the Labor right wing do not. On the other hand, that may be a kiss of death - so we are opposed to the members for Corio, Maribyrnong and Hotham! But, in terms of economic thinking, the Leader of the Opposition is back where he was in 1998 with his roll-back policy. He has shown no modernity, no maturity and no improvement. He is less ready for government now than he was then, and the Labor Party cannot be trusted in relation to economic policy.</DOC>

 - Thank you for the encouragement. I would like to recognise the member for Kooyong for his interest in this matter, along with a number of other colleagues in this place: the member for Gilmore in particular, the member for Hughes, the member for Blair, the member for Fisher, the member for Maranoa and the member for Flinders.Mr Speaker, you would be aware that the welfare of Australia's Defence Force men and women is a high priority for the government. Today I was pleased to announce that the ADF personnel who served in Rwanda from 1994 to 1995 will have their service recognised as warlike following a review by the Department of Defence and a decision by the Australian government.Mr Speaker, you would be aware that nearly 640 ADF personnel served in two six-month deployments in Rwanda at a terrible and tragic time when that conflict took the lives of an estimated 800,000 people who were brutally slaughtered. Our ADF personnel were doing life-saving work in that terrible environment. At the time, the then Labor government declared the service as 'hazardous', but facts and history show that that was probably not an accurate account of the threat, hardship and danger that our ADF personnel were faced with.In 2002 the Howard government put in place a process, a nature of service review, to enable these shortcomings to be revisited and to see that appropriate classifications were put in place. The shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Alan Griffin, rightly recognised the original decision by the then Labor government as a failure of policy. The Howard government put in place a mechanism to review those designations. Today we have announced that that particular engagement in Rwanda will be reclassified. That will bring immediate benefits to the ADF personnel involved, not only in recognition but also in ongoing access to existing entitlements and benefits, eligibility for the Australian Active Service Medal and also, where those veterans are unable to work, immediate access to the invalidity service pension. In the longer term, this designation also provides added support to those ADF personnel, with access to a gold card at age 70 providing free comprehensive health care, access to the service pension at age 60 and much comfort and support for their family members.I commend this announcement to the House. I recognise the interest of many colleagues in this place and I invite all members to recognise the great sacrifice and commitment of the ADF personnel in Rwanda who saw horrendous things - brutality and suffering that could not be imagined. We have made that right today with this announcement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. He does not just talk about health; late last year he walked 200 kilometres to raise $40,000 for cystic fibrosis research. Well done to the member for Bass. I can well understand why he is interested in the bulk-billing rate in Tasmania, because it has risen by almost 20 percentage points since the government's Strengthening Medicare changes began in December 2003. Bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare but it is important. It should be widely available, particularly to children and pensioners, and that is just what is happening, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.In the December quarter last year, the GP bulk-billing rate reached 75.1 per cent; that is, more than three out of four GP visits right around Australia are now bulk-billed. That is an 8.6 percentage point increase on December 2003. The bulk-billing rate in country areas, at almost 70 per cent, is at an all-time high. The bulk-billing rate for children under 16, at over 82 per cent, is at an all-time high. Tasmania is up 19.8 percentage points, South Australia is up 13.6 percentage points, Queensland is up 10.9 percentage points, Victoria is up 9.3 percentage points, Western Australia is up eight percentage points and New South Wales is up 5.6 percentage points to over 80 per cent. Over eight out of 10 visits to a GP in New South Wales are bulk-billed. These are the sorts of figures which demonstrate why the Australian people trust the Howard government with their health care. They understand, even if members opposite do not, that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know he is very concerned about the situation in Afghanistan because he is a very fine representative of many members of the Australian Defence Force.Progress so far in rebuilding what was destroyed by 25 years of conflict in Afghanistan has been remarkable. While, of course, there continue to be significant and serious problems, there has been very great progress. I was there myself, just before Christmas, and met with President Karzai, Foreign Minister Abdullah, the defence minister and other ministers and officials. I can observe this: although there have been outbreaks of violence, particularly in the south, and those outbreaks of violence continue, the wider perspective shows that those who seek to prevent the emergence of a stable and democratic Afghanistan are failing to achieve their objective.The government is proud of the role we played in helping to overthrow the Taliban and al-Qaeda back in 2001. In recent months we have increased our military deployments - in fact, we have sent an additional two helicopters and 110 support staff to boost the current 190-strong Special Forces Task Group. Our reconstruction efforts have also been very important. I am pleased to hear from my Afghan counterparts that our work has been much appreciated.We have indicated a willingness to send up to 200 more military personnel as part of a provincial reconstruction team and now that the Dutch have confirmed, as they did the week before last, that they will deploy, as part of what is called ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force III, we can make a final decision soon on this whole question of deploying military personnel as part of a broader provincial reconstruction team.I visited the Netherlands the other day and met with the Prime Minister, foreign and defence ministers. Not only did they have a very favourable view of this country, as it is the 400th anniversary this year of the first Dutchman - or European, for that matter - ever to visit Australia's shores; they have a very high regard for the Australian Defence Force, for its professionalism and for the work we are doing in Afghanistan.While I was in London I announced that Australia would provide another $150 million over five years to support the transition from conflict to peace in Afghanistan. This is on top of the $110 million that we pledged at the Berlin conference and that has now been disbursed in full.The government is making a very important and a very real effort to help the people of Afghanistan as their democracy emerges. We are pleased to observe that the opposition, on this particular issue, happens to support the government - presumably because the opposition gauges that this deployment and this support is more popular than the support we provide in Iraq. But, at the end of the day -  - and the Leader of the Opposition interjects - we know what is behind all this, and that was demonstrated in the election survey of Labor candidates at the last election, which showed -  -  - yes, again - that only 40 per cent of Labor candidates valued the American alliance as highly important; in other words, 60 per cent did not. The Leader of the Opposition and others ultimately are just playing to that kind of feral Left constituency.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I think all members of the House acknowledge her interest particularly in family law issues and the role of grandparents in families affected by separation. I am sure she and other members of the parliament will be interested in the recent research of the Institute of Family Studies which confirms the importance of grandparents in caring for children. This role can be even more crucial in cases where there is separation. Grandparents can exercise a moderating and calming influence at times of great stress and uncertainty for families.The government is interested in these matters because we are undertaking some of the most significant reforms to the family law system in some 30 years. These proposed changes to the family law system will see the role of grandparents better taken into consideration when family breakdown occurs. Parents will be encouraged to consider time spent with grandparents when developing a parenting plan. If the matter proceeds to court, the court will need to specifically consider the importance to the child of the relationship with grandparents.This government is also investing $397 million over four years to provide resources to help families, including with the establishment of 65 family relationship centres over time across Australia. These centres are intended to be family-friendly places where grandparents will be welcomed and supported if they are affected by the separation of their children.The government will also be providing funding to legal aid commissions to enable them to provide an expanded dispute resolution process to grandparents seeking contact with their grandchildren. This government recognises the valuable contribution of grandparents to children's lives and we are determined to assist them in making that contribution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and his continued interest in the updating of workplace relations in Australia. I can report to him that the Work Choices legislation received royal assent on 14 December last year. Since then the government has moved to establish the new Australian Fair Pay Commission and has also appointed the Award Review Task Force. This indicates that the government has a clear plan for Australia's future.As part of the reaction we have the contrast of the Labor Party, which is squibbing about when it might release its policy. On 22 November last year the Leader of the Opposition promised to release a workplace relations policy this year. He said:In terms of industrial relations, yes, we will, we'll be doing that next year. At the moment we're focussing on what the Government's legislation is but we're going to provide people with a very clear alternative.When might we see this very clear alternative? Perhaps not for some time, because the Leader of the Opposition spoke at the National Press Club on 1 February. He said that they would need some time to see what the effects are. He said:We will not, by the time we deliver this, have a full understanding of where the High Court is going to send their industrial relations legislation and nor will we have, because I don't believe this will really start to kick in in terms of its effect on the Australian workforce probably until next year ...Apart from being prolix, this is just nonsense. The Leader of the Opposition says to the National Press Club on 1 February, 'We don't know where this is going; we haven't got a policy,' yet repeatedly last year we heard him in this place saying he was going to rip up the Work Choices legislation. Nor does he need to wait, as he said in the National Press Club, to see the effects. If it is as bad as the Leader of the Opposition made out last year then he knows what the effects are.Can I remind the House of some of the effects that were predicted by the Leader of the Opposition: no more weekend barbecues, a higher divorce rate in Australia, kids not seeing their parents at Christmas time -  - global warming, Australian workplaces being South Americanised, the economic growth of Australia stopping, people not being able to pay their mortgages and the Australian way of life being destroyed. All of these things are the effects that the Leader of the Opposition said last year will be a consequence of the new Work Choices legislation. But when he goes along to the National Press Club this year he says, 'Oh, no - we've got to wait and see the effects.' The reality is that, when it comes to this policy, like any other policy, the Leader of the Opposition is clueless - no ideas, no policy and no leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and welcome his interest in the subject matter. As a large number of members would be aware, there were disturbances and demonstrations at Devonport over the weekend as a group of extreme animal liberationists attempted to disrupt a lawful and highly regulated trade of livestock. The animal liberationists on the spot would not know, let alone care, about the standards of animal welfare that govern Australia's livestock export trade. It is governed by much strengthened standards following the Keniry review in 2003. These standards are now much more community focused, with membership comprising representatives from all states and territories, industry and animal welfare groups. Since the Keniry report, the government has committed $4 million to improve the welfare of Australian animals shipped to the Middle East, especially on their arrival in countries that do not have Australia's high standards of receiving and processing.The Al Messilah loaded 72,000 sheep in Devonport bound for Kuwait and the UAE over the weekend. The ship had already loaded 900 cattle from Portland. It is reported that the shipment would mean in excess of $2½ million to farmers for stock that domestic processors had rejected late last year. There was no major incident regarding the quality and fitness for transport of the sheep. Of the 72,000 sheep, only 300 were deemed unfit for travel by the AQIS veterinarian and the exporter. This represents less than 0.5 per cent of the total load. The sheep were prepared in a feedlot in accordance with the livestock export standards and closely supervised by AQIS. An experienced shipboard veterinarian and stockman are accompanying the shipment, and daily voyage reports will be sent to AQIS. I congratulate the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association on their support of primary producers and the export industry and I sympathise with the Tasmanian police, who would have picked up a great many bruises and cuts as they tried to maintain the law at that time and at that place.Australia's highly regulated and world-class standard exports are at threat from animal liberationists, who are on an ideological bent and have no knowledge, care nor interest in the welfare of animals. If Australia stops supplying the market, other exporters with less concern and less of a proven track record would step in to fill the void. Australian involvement is therefore influencing change and improving animal welfare outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and absolutely reject any notion of recklessness or any other adjective you might like to apply to the way the government has conducted affairs on behalf of Australian wheat growers for the duration of its time in office. From the outset the government has been very diligent in ensuring that Australian wheat growers' interests have been looked after every inch of the way as far as this issue is concerned. The current circumstances - and I presume the Leader of the Opposition is referring to a decision announced yesterday - are regrettable, and the government will make representations to the Iraqi government on the decision that was taken yesterday. As far as this whole process is concerned, every time there has been an allegation raised we have pursued it and resolved it. The UN from start to finish have certified every single contract, and this government has done everything it possibly can to look after the interests of Australia's wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for the question. Yes, of course my attention has been drawn to the reported decision of the Iraqi Grains Board, and I share the concern expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I can inform the House of one or two quite important things. Earlier today I had a telephone conversation with the Chairman of AWB Ltd, Mr Brendan Stewart, regarding the current tender for wheat in Iraq. I naturally canvassed with him the reported decision of the Iraqi Grains Board and I also had the conversation against the background of the current provisions of the legislation governing the export of Australian wheat, which confer a monopoly on AWB Ltd. We have arranged to meet tomorrow in Canberra. He will be accompanied by the acting managing director of AWB Ltd, and the matter will be discussed.I know the member for Forrest, who is a champion of the Australian wheat industry, as indeed are other members -  -  - Did I say the member for Forrest? I apologise. I thought I was talking about the member for Lindsay, Mr Herbert! I apologise for that slip. I meant to say the member for Mallee, who is a great member for a great wheat-growing district of Australia and a passionate advocate for the interests of Australian wheat growers - as indeed are the member for Grey, the member for O'Connor, the member for Barker, my good friend the member for Gwydir, the member for Riverina, the member for Maranoa and so the list goes on. So too is the member for New England; they grow a bit of wheat there as well.Let me return to the essential grain of the question that was asked by the member for Mallee. I think the House is aware of the provisions of the existing legislation, and that legislation provides effectively a monopoly unless consent is given by AWB Ltd. On AWB Ltd, I will discuss all aspects of this issue with Mr Stewart tomorrow and that discussion will take place against a very simple proposition: our primary concern is the interests of the Australian wheat growers. The Australian wheat growers' best friends in this parliament are the Liberal and National parties. Let that be very clearly understood. - I also take the opportunity of saying a couple of things. Inevitably, this issue has raised some debate in the Australian community about the question of a single desk in relation to the sale of Australian wheat. That is an issue which has attracted debate on both sides of the argument. Let me say that it remains the government's policy to support the existing provisions. There would need to be a very strong national interest case in order to alter that. What we are considering now has to be looked at in isolation from the question of whether that remains an ongoing policy or not. I do not want anything that is said or done in the next little while to be seen to pre-empt a proper and careful consideration of that issue.I also remind the House of virtually a throwaway line. I have listened to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith. I recall, as many on this side of the House recall, back in 2002.

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and for her interest. In answering her question, let me begin by saying that the government has over and over made it clear that drug trafficking within Australia is an extremely serious offence; drug trafficking overseas, though, can bring even more severe penalties than in Australia, including life sentences and, in some cases, as we know from the tragic case of Van Nguyen in Singapore, death sentences.Yesterday the Denpasar District Court sentenced Renae Lawrence and Scott Rush to life in prison. We expect that another four Australians will hear their verdicts today and I understand that we will hear the remaining three verdicts tomorrow. Following the verdicts at the District Court in Denpasar, defendants can appeal. They can appeal to the Bali High Court and, if they are not satisfied with that appeal, they can subsequently appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court.While a life sentence in Bali means just that, it does not in all cases mean imprisonment for the duration of a person's natural life. After five years of a life sentence, a prisoner who has shown good behaviour can apply for the sentence to be changed to a fixed term sentence. If that is granted, the longest term the prisoner can be required to serve is a further 15 years. Honourable members will be interested to know that.On 18 December last year, I wrote to the Indonesian Attorney-General, reminding him that the Australian government was opposed to the death sentence and that, in the context of the Bali nine, we did not want to see any of the Australians sentenced to death. I noted, of course, that we fully respected Indonesia's courts, the independence of those courts and the sovereign right of Indonesia to impose strong penalties against drug traffickers. And, of course, in broad principle, we agree that there should be tough penalties on drug trafficking. But, at the same time, the Australian government has a longstanding policy of opposition to the death penalty and the Australian government will always endeavour to ensure that Australians, when they are abroad, do not suffer the death penalty.Our embassy in Jakarta has also made representations, along similar lines, to the foreign minister and the Deputy Attorney-General. I understand that our Attorney-General and his colleague the Minister for Justice and Customs wrote to the Indonesian Attorney-General on two occasions, and certainly as late as January. We will always make representations on behalf of Australian citizens who are given the death penalty. We will always seek clemency on their behalf. It is important that the House understands that.Finally, let me say this, because I know that a lot of members will be interested in it. We have been discussing with the Indonesian authorities a prisoner exchange agreement. These discussions are in an early stage. Let me remind the House that similar negotiations with Thailand took five years. With Indonesia I hope that the negotiations will take nothing like five years, but they could take time. Of course, we as a government should continue to do our best to make sure we can negotiate a satisfactory agreement. What implications such an agreement would have for people currently in jail in Indonesia we do not know yet, because those negotiations are still under way.These cases are tragic, but they are a very stark, very harsh reminder to people that trafficking in drugs is a very serious offence, and in Asia it brings extremely severe penalties, sometimes including the death penalty. Our consular officers will do all they can to continue to visit the prisoners regularly and provide support for as long as it is needed.</DOC>

 - I have not seen that evidence given by the Chief Executive Officer of WEA. With regard to my comments can I make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that when the Volcker investigators came to Australia my recollection is that they spent almost two weeks with DFAT officials going through the list of electronic files and getting the hard copies of what they required. Two weeks they spent down at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade going through those files. That is how we have cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, and that was recognised. The cooperation of the Australian government was recognised by Volcker himself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and his interest. He is a good member and he asks good questions. The Volcker inquiry, which honourable members may have already noticed, examined allegations of corruption of the United Nations oil for food program. It was completed in October 2005. Overall the Volcker report found evidence that illicit payments in relation to humanitarian sales had been made by 2,200 companies in 66 different countries. Honourable members may be interested in what has happened in other countries. For example, there were 14 British companies identified, 15 Swedish companies, over 50 German companies, 21 Danish companies, over 50 Swiss companies, four Canadian companies and two New Zealand companies.The Secretary-General of the United Nations said that he hoped that national authorities would take action against companies falling within their jurisdictions. Within 14 days of the Volcker report being handed down, the Australian government established the Cole inquiry, with the powers of a royal commission. I think that was a very strong and a very principled response, and I am sure that is very much appreciated by the United Nations.Of the 65 other countries named, many of them took no action at all. Of those that have taken action, and I include countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden - countries that I think on the whole we would regard as somewhat comparable with Australia - they have simply referred the Volcker allegations to police or prosecutors for investigation. That has certainly been the approach of the British government of Tony Blair. He has not chosen to establish an independent inquiry of the kind that has been established here in Australia.Only two countries, as far as I am aware, have set up inquiries. One of them is a behind-closed-doors inquiry that was established by India. The other is an inquiry that has just very recently been established in South Africa. Neither of these inquiries have so far conducted forensic and open hearings of the kind we have seen conducted by the Cole inquiry. I do not think this is a contestable proposition. No other country - and there are 66 countries involved here; not just Australia -  -  - The opposition wants to bag Australia. I think Australia is a great country and I am on Australia's side. They bag Australia, which is of course the approach of the opposition to foreign policy - bag Australia; the little Australia, small country mentality. We stick up for Australia on this side of the House. Proudly we say that, of the 66 countries who had companies identified in the Volcker commission, this is the only country that has set up a fully transparent inquiry with royal commission powers, as we call it - in our case, in the form of the Cole commission. - Quite contrary to the phoney arguments being made by the opposition, this country stands tall as the one country that has been transparent and up-front in addressing this issue. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can inform him that the NAB released its business survey in January 2006. It showed a significant moderation, with trading conditions losing most of the gain that they had in December. Capacity utilisation fell significantly and forward orders weakened. However, the business confidence index - an indication of business activity in the month ahead - improved slightly, by 10 points, and confidence levels remain above the 2005 average and the long-term average. ABS lending finance data was also released today and shows that commercial finance fell in December, although there was a very large increase in the month of November. Personal finance increased by 1.9 per cent, but, despite that, it was 3.3 per cent lower throughout the year.Also adding to confidence and economic prospects in the economy was the Australian Unity wellbeing index, the happiness index, which was released yesterday. I just want to say a big congratulation to the member for Wide Bay, the happiest kingdom in Australia. Of course, I visited that electorate last year -  - shortly before the index was taken, I think. Not that there is any connection, but if anybody else would like to get their way up the index, I am available. I did notice that in the bottom 11 of the happiness index was the seat of Hotham. There is a lot of unhappiness in Hotham at the moment. I do not know where the member for Hotham is, but I did read in the paper that he is knocking on the doors of branch members in the electorate of Hotham - wouldn't that give you a shock? - trying to save his preselection, while the Leader of the Opposition presides over the exit from parliament of his one-time deputy and one-time leader. It is not enough to depose him; he now wants him out of the parliament. One Labor member in Glenn Milne's column yesterday -  -  -  One Labor member in Glenn Milne's column yesterday described this unloading of the member for Hotham by the Leader of the Opposition as 'a gutless hitbag'. - Mr Speaker, I am talking about confidence and happiness and the unhappiness in the electorate of Hotham over the Leader of the Opposition unloading their much beloved member. The Leader of the Opposition has just come to the dispatch box and said it is not true, but he could issue one statement -  - Described in the Glenn Milne column yesterday as 'a gutless hitbag' -  -  - Mr Speaker, one of the ways that confidence could be promoted in the electorate of Hotham is by the Leader of the Opposition, far from being pathetic, getting behind the member for Hotham and telling the faceless men to lay off him!</DOC>

 - Just so the Leader of the Opposition is aware, the WEA report that he has been asking questions about is a confidential report to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and legislation precludes its public release. The Leader of the Opposition has been offered the opportunity to have a look at this. - No, it is not. If  the Leader of the Opposition waits and listens, he will find out. The WEA report that is referred to in the Leader of the Opposition's question is a confidential report to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and legislation precludes its public release. Last week, it was offered to the Leader of the Opposition to have a look at that report.

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I recognise that he represents the largest electorate in Australia and also the majority of our large resource exploration areas in Australia, and he is doing a very good job in that vast part of Western Australia. He asks about Australia's resource exports. Australia's resource exports have again hit record levels in 2005. I know that the member for Kalgoorlie is excited about that, because that means jobs right throughout his electorate of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.Our reputation as a safe, reliable and competitively priced supplier is helping our exporters win big on the international market. We are currently in the middle of a global resources boom. It is one of Australia's competitive advantages that we are incredibly well endowed with resources across the country, across a number of sectors, and our companies are taking advantage of that. I will give just some examples. One is our biggest ever export deal with Mexico. Two Australian suppliers will supply $688 million worth of coal to Mexico in the next 18 months. I acknowledge that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has been heavily involved in helping to put that deal together. In Western Australia, the LNG industry - and I was recently up in Karratha, in the member's electorate, having a look at the operation there - is also on the cusp of a new era. The first shipments of a $25 billion China contract start this year. The Bayu-Undan LNG field recently started shipments to Japan, and two new projects at Gorgon and Pluto look set to develop after a series of multibillion-dollar preliminary deals with Japanese buyers late last year.So we can see that the resources sector is booming. There is a global resources boom under way at the moment and, importantly, our industries in Australia are taking advantage of that, because these resources and the reserves in Australia are the competitive advantage that we have. It is important to recognise the job that particularly the private sector is doing in maintaining investment in ports and infrastructure to make sure that there are no bottlenecks in getting those bulk products out of those ports and down those rail links. Billions of dollars are being spent in those ports and rail links, particularly in the north-west of Western Australia. That is in stark comparison to what a lot of the state owned enterprises are doing - or not doing - on the eastern seaboard, where we have been experiencing bottlenecks, particularly as far as our coal exports are concerned. As a nation we should get behind and support these major Australian companies exporting these resources out of Australia which have delivered another export record in 2005 for resource exports.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Barker for his question. This might be a rather longer answer than usual. This government does not just talk about country people; we spend the money necessary to improve their health services. Thanks to the incentive payments that were part of Strengthening Medicare, the GP bulk-billing rate in country Australia is at an all-time high at almost 70 per cent. That is a new record, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.In January, the government announced that it would double incentive payments to GP proceduralists - that is, GPs who do anaesthesia, obstetrics and surgery - to try to ensure that country hospitals do not lose their doctors. Also in January, the government announced a new Medicare payment for antenatal checks in country areas which are delivered by nurses and midwives on behalf of GPs. I should point out to the House that this is the first time that midwives have been brought under the Medicare system.The recent pharmacy agreement increased funding for rural pharmacy programs by more than 50 per cent, to $111 million. Today the government announced a new rural clinical school at Tamworth. Soon there will be 13 rural clinical schools around Australia to ensure that one-quarter of medical students do at least 50 per cent of their clinical training in country areas. Before Christmas, the government committed $1 million to help the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine to upgrade its training programs.In all of these matters, the government has sought the advice of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia. I pay tribute to its recently retired president, Dr Sue Page. It is impossible to entirely end the tyranny of distance but this government is always looking for new ways to help country Australians, which is why it is truly said that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I will let the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry speak for himself about his statement. I make the point that the report the member for Griffith is referring to is a report on the oil for food program to the CPA - which is something that I mentioned in this place yesterday - that was for official use only. It assessed a number of contracts that were approved by the UN under the oil for food program, but those contracts that had been approved under the oil for food program had not been completed or delivered.Two were listed there, and this is where the member for Griffith has been misleading the House. Of the two listed Australian wheat contracts - obviously one was the AWB - one was identified as 'potentially overpriced'. It was not in the language that the member for Griffith used. It was not 'containing kickbacks'. That report went to the CPA. Both contracts were reprioritised by the CPA and delivered and paid for by the World Food Program. They had not been delivered under the UN oil for food program; they were checked out by the CPA. The CPA went on with them, and they were paid for by the World Food Program. To prove the point, on ABC Radio this morning, the head of the CPA, Paul Bremer, said in answer to questions from Fran Kelly:So we knew there was corruption. I don't remember hearing about the Australian Wheat Board.He was then asked:Would it surprise you to know that countries involved with those industries, and involved with the CPA in fact, as Australia was there in Iraq, might not have known of those set asides or those kind of kickbacks?He said again:I don't remember hearing about the Australian Wheat Board.That was the CPA, which ultimately approved those contracts that you referred to. They had them delivered, and had them paid for by the World Food Program.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I acknowledge his keen interest in transport issues and particularly in aviation matters. I am pleased to report to the House that, last week, the government secured an agreement with Brazil on a draft treaty to provide scheduled air services between our two countries. This agreement has the potential to strengthen the links, the trade and other opportunities between Australia and one of the fastest growing economies in the world - a country with 180 million people - and to increase interests and matters in common with Australia. This new agreement will allow international airlines of both countries to operate up to seven weekly services, using any type of passenger aircraft. They will also be able to operate up to three weekly air cargo services each, and that will provide opportunities to build also the air freight between our countries.Forty thousand people travelled between Brazil and Australia in the 12 months to October 2005. This is a market that has been growing at about eight per cent per annum since 1999. Our yearly airfreighted exports to Brazil are valued at $42 million.While no airline at the moment has plans to take up these rights, it does give us the opportunity to develop services over the months and years ahead and to broaden the travel opportunities between Australia and South America. Over the last 12 months my department has held a wide range of bilateral aviation discussions with countries like Argentina, Austria, Germany, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and also informal discussions with the United States of America. We are achieving, bit by bit, opportunities for Australian airlines to operate into other parts of the world and to provide more opportunities for Australians to have choice in the way in which they travel around the world and to visit more countries by way of direct services.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. He would have been disturbed by the incidents over the weekend of animal rights activists at Devonport in his electorate attempting to disrupt or prevent a legitimate and lawful trade in Australian livestock. Even more disturbing to the member for Braddon, to me and to interested members of parliament would have been the response since that disgraceful behaviour over the weekend, where we saw a press release issued by Senator Bartlett of the Australian Democrats which made a couple of claims. The first is:... ending live exports, there would be minimal impact on most rural sectors and extra jobs in the regional areas which so desperately need them.Abolish the livestock export trade, according to Senator Bartlett, and you lose no jobs. It is $1 billion every year in income, a trade in which there are hundreds - indeed thousands - of jobs involved for transporters, processors and handlers as well as, of course, the farmers who produce the stock. So the absurdity of that economic equation by Senator Bartlett defies belief. It is so unnecessary, because we have the highest standards in the world. If we were to vacate the field, as Senator Bartlett suggests, then our international competitors would fill the void in an instant, leaving Australian farmers, their families, farm workers and all those through the supply chain without jobs, without income. It shows a complete lack of understanding by Senator Bartlett and the Democrats, as well as animal liberationists, of the interests of Australian agricultural families and the like.The second claim by Senator Bartlett is that you could replace the livestock export trade with 'a thriving export market for processed meat from Australia'. The fact is that many of the Muslim countries in the Middle East and Asia hold a strong preference for fresh meat because of consumer requirements and religious beliefs. Also, many of the markets do not have refrigeration - not at the point of disembarkation, not in transport vehicles, not in homes - so there are issues of food safety. At the same time, in many communities cultural and religious preferences demand that meat needs to be purchased and consumed near where the livestock is slaughtered.The Australian livestock trade under this government will continue under the highest possible standards, and the government will continue to support a vital export trade that supports our rural and national economies. But will the Labor Party? When are we going to get a commitment from the Labor Party on support for the livestock export trade and all the safeguards in place? Joining Senator Bartlett in calling for the industry to stop overnight is the Meat Workers Union, a Labor Party associate. - The shadow minister for agriculture is trying to lift his profile. He is trying to make his electorate more happy. He wants to go up the index. Invite the Treasurer or else support Australian farmers.</DOC>

I do read some international papers, but I cannot recall reading that particular edition.Just as a general point to the member for Griffith: right through this debate, when allegations and assertions have been made, the government has made inquiries, got the information and taken it back to the UN. The UN Security Council 661 committee, which had responsibility for the certification of these contracts, every time continued to certify those contracts and those contracts continued to be operated on.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I acknowledge his deep interest in this issue. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that over 22,000 students will benefit this year from a 2006 Commonwealth learning scholarship. The member for Solomon would be pleased to learn that Indigenous students and students from rural, regional and remote areas are most likely to benefit. These scholarships are part of a $400 million investment over five years by the Australian government to assist students in higher education with their education and accommodation costs. Specifically this year, $68 million will be allocated to scholarships to assist over 5,000 new students and 7,500 continuing students with a scholarship for their education costs, each valued at about $2,000 to $2,080; and to assist over 3,500 new students and 6,500 continuing students with an accommodation scholarship to assist with their accommodation costs, each valued at about $4,100.Compare this government's commitment to Indigenous and rural and regional students with that of the ALP. The ALP voted against $400 million worth of scholarships over five years. They voted against it as part of their opposition to an $11 billion package over the next decade in Backing Australia's Future. These scholarships are evidence of the Howard government's commitment to ensuring greater participation and greater equity for Indigenous students and students from rural, regional and remote areas.</DOC>

 - I know that it is Valentine's day, but be calm. I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I know that he, like everyone else in this House - and I am being generous to the Labor Party here - believes that we have to improve service quality in Centrelink offices to ensure that those who are seeking services are getting the services that they are entitled to.It was brought to my attention early on in the ministry that in some cases Centrelink staff were taking as many days in unplanned absences as they were in holidays each year. This was having a profound effect on the staffing levels of the over 300 customer service centres across the Centrelink network. -  - In order to address this, the management of Centrelink worked closely with the staff to try to reduce the number of unplanned absences during the year. In six months we have reduced the number of days that have been lost to unplanned absences by 24,000 - 24,000 days have been claimed back from unplanned absences by Centrelink staff. That is the equivalent of setting up a new call centre of approximately 200 people. It is the equivalent of setting up four new Centrelink offices. -  - The Labor Party tend to treat this as a joke. - It is very important for the 24,000 staff of Centrelink but, even more importantly, it is a significant improvement in service for the six million customers of Centrelink because it means that the queues will be smaller and that there is more likely to be someone answering the phone. There is still some way to go, but clawing back 24,000 lost days is a significant step forward and a further indication of the commitment of the government to improve service delivery by the Commonwealth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey, who represents many wheat growers, for this question. Today, with the Deputy Prime Minister and other senior ministers, I met the Executive Chairman and the Acting Managing Director of AWB Ltd to discuss the current tender for wheat in Iraq. I emphasised that the government was not prejudging the outcomes of the Cole inquiry or making any judgments about AWB. I also made it clear that the question of the single desk was a separate issue and not currently under consideration by the Australian government. The government's principal concern, and I know it is of the member for Grey, is the wellbeing of Australian wheat growers.The government noted the statements by the Iraqi Grain Board that business relations with AWB would be suspended until the results of the Cole inquiry were known. The government is continuing to make representations to the Iraqi government on access for Australian wheat into the Iraqi market, noting reports that the tender process has been deferred.Taking advantage of the time available from this deferral, the government will send a delegation to Iraq to discuss the current Iraqi tender. The delegation will leave as soon as possible. The delegation will be led by my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister and trade minister. It will include the Executive Chairman of AWB Ltd, Mr Brendan Stewart, for the very simple reason that AWB holds the wheat in the pool. The delegation will also include representatives of Australian wheat growers.The delegation's goal is to protect the interests of Australian wheat growers and the value of the wheat in the Australian pool. The delegation will explore all options to secure the continued access of Australian wheat to this important market. Among these options AWB Ltd has indicated its willingness, on a voluntary basis, not to exercise its veto on this tender if necessary to secure a positive outcome for Australian wheat growers. The Australian government is committed to working with the Australian wheat industry to secure our longstanding markets and the best outcome for Australian wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. The member for Riverina represents an area that produces a lot of prime hard wheat in the state of New South Wales. It goes to exports to many of the markets across the world.While the Australian Labor Party engage in this blatant politicking around this issue and make themselves out as having now become the best friend of US Wheat Associates - that is what the Australian Labor Party have done; they have become the best friend of US Wheat Associates, who are competitors with Australian wheat growers - we are getting on and looking after the interests of Australian grain growers. Iraq is one of our top five wheat markets and is a key market. It has been a key market for over 50 years. We are going to continue to make every effort to protect our growers' interests in that market. - On Monday I asked our ambassador to Iraq to make representations to the Iraqi government over wheat sales during the Cole inquiry. The ambassador met with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi overnight. Mr Chalabi has assured us that the Iraqis want to continue to buy Australian wheat. I note that Iraq has rejected a tender from the US wheat growers in recent days, while another of our top five markets, Egypt, has just confirmed another order with AWB overnight.The message that I am hearing from Australian wheat growers is that they want the National and Liberal parties to keep Ruddy's hands off their interests and the single desk. As the Grains Council of Australia said in a recent media release, 'grain producers refuse to suffer the consequences of the political grandstanding and loose talk' - particularly that coming from the ALP.More than 80 per cent of Australian wheat growers support the single desk. We know the Labor Party's view about the single desk. The member for Hunter has made some comments on the Labor Party's website about the single desk. - We know what the Labor Party will do with the single desk. - the Australian Labor Party on this. When we are talking about the interests of Australian wheat growers, it is interesting to note that there are not too many people on the Labor Party side that have much experience, let alone any interest, in Australian wheat growers and wheat farming in Australia. There are a couple of people. One is the shadow minister, the member for Corio, who presumably has taken the opportunity to talk to wheat growers across Australia. But what has the Leader of the Opposition done to him? He has cut him adrift in his preselection to get rid of him - to get out of the system the one person who knows something about it. The one person in the Labor Party who has had any ministerial experience in the Australian wheat industry is the member for Hotham, and the Leader of the Opposition has certainly cut him adrift. At least he has had experience - and you are going to get rid of him. You are going to get rid of him from your front bench. You are going to let some union hack come in and represent the seat of Hotham. He is finding it hard to keep it. We wish him well. But it is a fact: he is the only member of the Labor Party that has any experience with Australian wheat growers. -  - The point is that the government is doing everything that it possibly can to ensure that we maintain access into the markets of the world for Australian wheat growers. - Yes.</DOC>

 - This is again part of the political scaremongering campaign that the member for Griffith is running on this issue to progress his own leadership aspirations. He has been in the media all the time talking about how he has still got the baton in the knapsack. He continues to say that -  - The core of the member for Griffith's question was about how quickly the government moved to look after the interests of Australian wheat growers. Can I say that the government moved very quickly to assist the Volcker inquiry; the government moved very quickly to establish the Cole commission of inquiry, straight after Volcker reported; and, when the news came out about the Iraqi market this week, the government moved very quickly to look after the interests of Australian wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can tell him that the Australian government has been working on a range of measures to respond to the threat of a pandemic caused by avian influenza. The government has budgeted a total of $555 million over five years, including $414 million on domestic health responses and $141 million to help our regional neighbours.It should be stated that there has been no case yet of human to human transmission of the virus, but most of the preparations are going ahead on the possibility that that could occur - a possibility that is assessed at around a 10 per cent chance by international health authorities. A similar assessment has been made by Australia's Chief Medical Officer.Today the Australian Treasury has released a working paper called A primer on the macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic. It tries to have a look at the economic effects of a pandemic. One should say at the outset that all of these things are based largely on assumptions and one cannot be particularly precise about what would happen to the economy in the event of an outbreak. But the paper does say that confidence effects on both business and consumers would be severe; tourism services would be particularly affected; and the consequences on the overall economy could be very severe. The paper notes that the Australian authorities are well placed to deal with a pandemic and it highlights as policy implications the role of government in promoting an environment where people can quickly resume economic activity, and the role that monetary and fiscal policy will need to play in stimulating the Australian economy.The fact that the Treasury has released this paper, and modelling has been done, does not mean that a pandemic is inevitable. All steps will be taken here in Australia and, I believe, around the world to try and do what can be done to prevent such a pandemic occurring. But we must prepare on a worst possible case basis. I want to assure the Australian public that our preparations in the health area and in regional cooperation are advanced, as too are our preparations in the economic area, for an event that we hope never occurs.</DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, when the Volcker inquiry came to Australia the investigators spent two weeks at DFAT going through the documentation. We assisted them and gave every bit of information that they had on this whole issue. That was recognised by Volcker. The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 -  - As I was saying, I answered this question from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. The answer is the same today, in that the government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry. Volcker investigators spent two weeks at DFAT going through documentation. Those were DFAT documents but documents from across government. We now have established the Cole commission of inquiry, which is the Australian inquiry. The government is cooperating fully with the Cole commission of inquiry.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. Let me begin by making this point perfectly clear: the Australian government regards drug trafficking as an extremely serious offence. It is the view of the Australian government that we should do all we reasonably can to stop the trafficking of drugs into Australia. We work with other countries in the region and beyond the region in order to achieve that objective, and we do that unapologetically because we do that in the interests of protecting the Australian community. We know we are protecting the lives of Australians by stopping drug trafficking. A number of Australians are facing charges overseas; there are 223 in total in 56 countries. Of those people, 54 are facing drug charges and 22 are facing drug charges in Asia. In terms of those who have been sentenced, there are 188 Australians serving sentences overseas. Of those, 87 have drug related convictions and 42 of those are in Asia. The simple point is that there are a high number of Australians who have been arrested and convicted for trafficking in drugs, and these people should not have been trafficking in drugs in the first place.In the second place, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through our embassies and consulates overseas, do, if people are arrested, provide consular assistance - that is, consular officers visit those arrested as soon as possible; they give them a list of local lawyers; they continue to visit them regularly; they attend trials if possible, which is usually the case; they keep families informed; they monitor the situation to ensure that Australians in custody are treated properly; and they take up with prison authorities any well-founded concerns about a prisoner's health, ill-treatment or security.I am sure all honourable members know this, but I think more broadly in the community it needs to be remembered that the Australian government cannot intervene in legal cases in other countries, just as we do not intervene in court processes in Australia in the normal course of events. Of course, we would not tolerate foreign governments intervening in our own courts or legal processes either. We cannot just get Australians released from prison. We cannot, if you like, launch rescue missions into other countries. At the end of the day it is up to individuals to take responsibility for their own behaviour.In conclusion, and I said this yesterday, when it comes to Australians being sentenced to death, we will always plead for clemency for those people - that is, for the death sentence to be commuted to a substantial custodial sentence. In the case of the two Australians who were sentenced to death yesterday by the Denpasar District Court in Bali, they will be able to appeal that sentence to the Bali High Court and, if they are unsuccessful, subsequently to the Supreme Court of Indonesia. Through this process we have made clear and we will continue to make it clear to the Indonesian government that we would always seek an act of clemency by the President if the appeals fail.But that is not to detract from the very harsh view this government has of anybody who traffics drugs, including obviously heroin, because the consequences of drug trafficking for the people of Australia are very severe. Drug trafficking costs lives, and we do what we can to protect the lives of Australians, including of course seeking clemency for those who are sentenced to death. We have two Australians who have been sentenced to death in Vietnam, and we are making representations in support of a clemency appeal for them to the President of Vietnam. We have one in China, and we obviously make representations there, although in that particular case the Australian has been given a suspended death sentence. The final sentence will be determined on the basis of his behaviour in prison. We do seek clemency but, having said that, people who get involved in drug trafficking in Asia know the consequences. They should understand the consequences and they should understand that we do cooperate with our regional partners in order to try to crack down on drug trafficking so we can save lives in Australia.</DOC>

 - With reference to this matter, I repeat again what I said today and yesterday: the government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, with the investigators when they spent two weeks at DFAT going through the documentation and the electronic files down here. - I just make a couple of points here. If the Leader of the Opposition were prepared to keep on board his frontbenchers who knew something about this matter, he would understand the answer. They should know -  - The point I want to make is that the WEA, in terms of their inquiries and the work that they do, have certain restrictions imposed on them by the Wheat Marketing Act. The member for Hotham knows that, and I am sure the member for Corio knows that, but, because of the way the Leader of the Opposition is treating them, they are not likely to tell him. As I have said, the government has handed over all the documents and has assisted the Volcker inquiry fully.The WEA analysis, I am advised, was being undertaken while the Volcker inquiry was under way. That analysis - and they only look at AWB information - was based on AWB contract data, and they found no problems. The chair, Tim Besley, has already stated that. They found nothing untoward. When he gave that response the Labor Party attacked him personally in Senate estimates. The WEA analysis is based on AWB contract data. They do not have any information of their own; it is only AWB data. The government had encouraged AWB to cooperate fully with the Volcker inquiry, and DFAT cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and note his deep interest in this matter. Last Friday the Prime Minister announced the outcome of the COAG decision to increase the number of medical places in Australia and to increase the support for the costs of that education. Specifically, the Australian government will lift the cap on fully funded medical places from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. This will mean that up to 400 more medical students will be able to study medicine. These places are in addition to the 2,195 HECS places for medicine that will be made available up to 2008. In addition, the Prime Minister announced an increase in FEE-HELP for medical students - from $50,000 to $80,000.This was a most welcome announcement. It is interesting that the strongest proponent of this initiative was not the Prime Minister, although he supported the initiative, but a state Labor premier; it was Premier Peter Beattie. He was supported by the other state Labor premiers in this initiative. He was almost overcome with excitement. It is worth quoting from the transcript of the press release:PREMIER BEATTIE: Well, I'm happy, I'm very happy, these COAGs just get better. And you get happier too. As a result of today's decision the University of Queensland, in partnership with the Greenslopes Hospital  - the member for Griffith will be interested in this - will be able to start training another 60 doctors.  Now this is a result of lifting the quota from 10% to 25%.Premier Beattie goes on:I fully support this and I express my appreciation to my colleagues for supporting this proposition from Queensland because we do have a doctor shortage.He goes on:So today in terms of health it is a very significant breakthrough and I am delighted, as I said. I thank the Prime Minister ... my colleagues. I endorse all the other things that have been said. And as I said, the COAGs just get better.Premier Beattie was then reported in the Australian Financial Review as saying he would not allow ideology to stand in the way of a solution to the state's shortage of doctors. Perhaps Premier Beattie should have told his federal Labor counterparts, for we learn today that federal Labor will move to disallow the increase of the cap from 10 per cent to 25 per cent for medical students in this country. Labor will deny up to 400 medical students the opportunity to study medicine. They will be shutting out bright, competent students from undertaking a medical degree and building this country's health work force. - Once again, federal Labor members show how out of touch they are, not only with their state colleagues but with all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston - the very healthy member for Kingston - for his question. I can inform him that this government has long been committed to a health system which promotes wellness rather than just treats sickness, because, as all of us know, prevention is better than cure. In 2003 my distinguished predecessor, Senator Patterson, actually said that this government had 'installed prevention as the fourth pillar of the Australian health care system.'Way back in 1999 the government first introduced a comprehensive Medicare funded health check for people over 75. In 2004 the government introduced comprehensive Medicare funded health checks for Indigenous people over 15. These will be extended to Indigenous children shortly. Last week at COAG, the government announced a comprehensive Medicare funded health check for middle-aged people with health risks such as smoking or obesity. We did this because by 2020 it is estimated that 80 per cent of all health care costs will be due to chronic disease. Most of these diseases are linked to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise and they can be delayed or prevented by the right advice or the right treatment at the right time. That is precisely what we think will happen under this new Medicare item. What we saw last week, through COAG, was another example of a government which does not just talk about the health of the Australian people. We do not just talk about our Medicare system; we take the practical steps necessary to make a good system even better.</DOC>

 - I can report to the member for Deakin, who has a great interest in this matter, that all states and territories have now agreed to sign the national code for the building and construction industry. This means that some $12.7 billion worth of AusLink funding will now flow to important infrastructure projects right around Australia.I remind the House that the national code is a set of principles which prescribe best practice in respect of a number of things: workplace relations; occupational health and safety; procurement; and security of payment. The national code also upholds freedom of association, right of entry and the promotion of best practice in relation to standards of honesty and fair dealing in the building and construction industry.In addition to this, all state government projects which receive Commonwealth funding will also comply with the code in the future. That means that we have a much better chance of eliminating the rorts and inefficiencies that have existed in this industry in the past and of ensuring that taxpayers' money is saved on major construction projects.In contrast to what the Commonwealth has sought to do - and the states have finally paid up - we have seen just in the last day or so some further instances where state government projects which do not comply and had not complied with the building construction code in the past have led to major imposts in terms of the outcome. For example, in the Australian newspaper yesterday, it is reported that Grocon, the builder responsible for the redevelopment of the MCG in Melbourne where the Commonwealth Games will largely occur in a few weeks time, is suing for some $50 million in relation to a cost blow-out because of a failure to comply with the sorts of things which are in the building construction code. We also read in the same article that Leighton Holdings, the builders of the new Southern Cross Station in Melbourne, are also seeking some $54 million from the state government in Victoria, again because of a failure to ensure that we had a lawful system operating.This is not just isolated to Victoria and the Labor government of Victoria. In Western Australia we had a report yesterday, this time in the West Australian newspaper, that Leightons are also seeking claims against the state Labor government in Western Australia for cost blow-outs on the Perth to Mandurah railway line, which have reached almost $300 million.Putting this code in place and having the Labor states and territories sign up to it means that we will have a better chance in the future of eliminating the sorts of debacles which I have illustrated today. The irony is that, after each Labor state and territory government has signed up to the national code, there is only one Labor Party in Australia that now does not support the national code. Which Labor Party would that be? None other than the federal Labor Party. 
A government member - The Beazley party. - The Beazley party, although we do not know for how much longer. It is only the federal Labor Party that does not support the national code. Of course, there would not be any coincidence in the fact that the CFMEU last year donated to federal Labor some $670,000!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I know of her particular interest in the importance of families, including support for families and protecting children from violence. This government has introduced the most significant changes in family law that we have seen for some 30 years. These reforms are designed to protect children from the risk of violence or abuse, making that a primary factor to be considered in child custody cases, along with, as I have said for some time, the right of children to know both of their parents. This legislation will also go a long way to changing the lawyer-driven culture that dominates family separation in Australia today. We want children to be protected from exposure to violence and from growing up with conflict when parents separate, but our view is that the court should be the last resort, not the first.Yesterday the member for Gellibrand issued a press release which claimed that Labor generally - I note the word 'generally' - supports these changes. Yet the amendments she proposed were clearly designed to undermine them. I read the release very carefully. She said:Family law should not be about a tug-of-war between mums or dads, or a brawl between Liberal and Labor.I have to say that there has been no brawl between the government and the Labor Party - at least, the majority of members of the Labor Party who served on the parliamentary committee that considered these matters.I noticed amongst the amendments that the Labor Party is proposing: an amendment to the definition of family violence, which overturns the committee's recommendation; removal of the two-tier hierarchy of best interest factors, which would remove the hierarchy approved by the committee; changes to equal, shared parental responsibility - to be moved back to joint parental responsibility - which overturns the committee's recommendation; omitting the cost provisions relating to false allegations, which overturns the committee's recommendation; and a modification of the enforcement provisions, which overturns the committee's recommendation.It is quite clear that, in relation to these matters, the member for Gellibrand wants to remove the requirement that parents who go to court should first make a genuine effort to resolve their issues by mediation. This and other amendments that she proposes clearly conflict with the views of the member for Lowe, the member for Chifley and the member for Denison, who were party to the committee report and whose recommendations I have accepted. So the important question is not, in the terms the honourable member used, whether or not we will have a brawl between Liberal and Labor; the question is whether we will adopt the measures proposed by a committee that had bipartisan support from the member for Lowe, the member for Chifley and the member for Denison or whether we will adopt the unilateral view of the member for Gellibrand on this issue. I think children deserve better than the status quo in our family law system, and I would hope the parliament would support the measures that we are vigorously pressing, which had the support of so many members of parliament from both sides.</DOC>

As far as the single desk arrangements are concerned, the government has continued to make very clear its commitment to the single desk while the global markets are as distorted as they are and while the single desk provides the service that is needed by Australian wheat growers. We are seeing that at the moment where there are enormous levels of export subsidies provided by the European Community and enormous levels of domestic support - I read some out in the parliament earlier this week - provided to US wheat growers, the people whom you would think were the Australian Labor Party's best friends. So the current arrangements that are in place are there to best serve Australian wheat growers - to ensure they are as competitive as they possibly can be in the circumstances they confront in the global marketplace. The government's policy is that we keep those arrangements in place while we are confronting those global distortions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question and also for his strong interest in the provision of scientific solutions to greenhouse gas emissions. This government stands proud of its record on greenhouse gas abatement. Greenhouse gas emissions will rise only eight per cent between 1990 and 2010 while, during a similar time, the economy will almost double in size. It is by any global measure an impressive result and one which Australian industry is very much a part of achieving. The aluminium smelting industry, a member of the government's Greenhouse Challenge program, has cut emissions by 48 per cent per tonne of product produced, while the cement industry has likewise achieved cuts of some 15 per cent per tonne of product produced.Industry action continues to be mobilised through government initiatives, such as our $500 million low emissions technology demonstration fund, the $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative, the $75 million Solar Cities initiative and, more recently, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, including a further $100 million towards that process, of which some $25 million is exclusively set aside for renewable energy. It is by any measure a sign of the government's practical approach that keeps our economy strong and makes inroads into greenhouse gas emissions.I am asked by the member for Tangney about alternative policies. Almost two years after the government unveiled its $700 million energy white paper, the Leader of the Opposition says he is almost ready to respond. Of course, along with the member for Grayndler, the Leader of the Opposition remains blindly and ideologically committed to a Beazley government ratifying the Kyoto protocol and sending Australian jobs offshore. But the voices of reason within Labor are starting to sound on these matters. The member for Batman - and he knows this is coming - has said:It's time to abandon the political correctness espoused by the green movement ... Let's be real: without getting business on board we cannot achieve anything.If the Leader of the Opposition is fair dinkum about Australian jobs then he should take some advice from the member for Hunter, who said recently on his local radio station that the Kyoto protocol is 'pretty much dead in the water'.The government has the balance right between jobs, growth and greenhouse gas reductions - practical solutions to a global problem rather than the pontificating and idealism that we see from the Leader of the Opposition. Some on the ALP front bench are acknowledging the government's progress in this area. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition did that as well and got behind sensible policies to deal with climate change.</DOC>

 - I did not mislead the House. Let me repeat that the information that I gave in that answer was a very fair and accurate reflection of the way in which the government had responded to Volcker. Let me further inform the House that the Chief Executive Officer of WEA has advised his minister - and I have in turn been advised - that he and senior members of his staff met with the UN senior investigator, Bernard O'Donnell, and his assistant, Mr Trevor Sutton, at WEA offices in Canberra on 25 February 2005. WEA informed O'Donnell of the role of WEA and of the confidentiality constraints of the Wheat Marketing Act as well as those between WEA and AWB International. WEA advised that, in order to provide material to the Volcker inquiry, WEA would require the consent of AWB International. The authority suggested that the detailed material being requested by Volcker would most likely be held by AWBI. O'Donnell acknowledged the WEA's position and informed the authority that he would shortly meet AWBI people in Melbourne.It is perfectly plain from that that we have followed a transparent process. Once again, this attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to misrepresent the behaviour of the government, to slur decent public servants and to slur decent ministers is being exposed for what it is. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition - who prances around this country feigning outrage - that, alone among the governments of this world, the government I lead has established a transparent inquiry with the powers of a royal commission, and they will get to the bottom of it. I look forward to debating the conclusion of that inquiry with the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and his interest. As I think the House is beginning to know now, the final Volcker report was issued in October 2005, very recently. Like Australia, the United Kingdom government fully cooperated, to the best of my understanding, with the Volcker commission, but in the final report there were 14 British companies named as having been involved with illicit payments, including two from the giant pharmaceutical group Glaxo, which I think honourable members would be familiar with.By the way, the report also named a number of UK personalities as having received barrels of oil from Saddam Hussein, including the member of the House of Commons for Bethnal Green and Bow, Mr George Galloway. Honourable members will remember that this once Labour member of parliament was a very strong supporter of Saddam Hussein.Following the publication of the Volcker report - and there is absolutely no evidence that the British government had any involvement in or complicity with the payment of kickbacks by the 14 British companies - the British government stated, on 22 November last year, that it would bring the report to the attention of the Serious Fraud Office and they would review Volcker to determine whether further investigations were warranted. But what the British government did not do - and made perfectly clear it would not do - was set up a separate independent inquiry or a royal commission.In saying that, I make no criticism of the British government, despite the fact that there were 14 British companies involved. What is interesting is that there are not allegations in Britain that the British government should have known all about those 14 companies being involved in making illicit payments to entities in Saddam Hussein's regime.It simply follows that in this country the government has set up an independent commission of inquiry with all the powers of a royal commission, and that independent commission of inquiry is able to review all of the evidence and to make findings. We look forward to hearing what the Cole commission has to say on or around 31 March when it is scheduled to complete its work.But I make the point that, of the 65 other countries which had over 2,000 companies that Volcker found had been involved in kickbacks - 14 in the UK, four in Canada, 15 in Sweden, over 50 in Germany, two in New Zealand, 21 in Denmark and over 50 in Switzerland - none has set up an inquiry that is commensurate with the Cole inquiry. None of them has set up a transparent and open process in the way we have. And I know, from the response our diplomats are getting around the world, that what the Australian government has done in response to this has been well received and well regarded.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. The chain of events is very simple. Volcker carried out an investigation. He had the full cooperation of this government. Whether he had the full cooperation of other governments, or the full cooperation of AWB Ltd, is a matter for those respective parties to answer.It is worth reminding the House that even Volcker said in his finding that there was no direct evidence that AWB Ltd knew of the kickbacks, rather that they should have known. There was no finding against the government - none at all. And not a skerrick of evidence has been produced by the Leader of the Opposition to justify the falsehood that he continues to assert in this parliament.I invite the Leader of the Opposition to produce some evidence as distinct from just rhetorical assertions. They have spent a couple of weeks slurring the reputation of the Deputy Prime Minister. They have spent a couple of weeks slurring the reputations of senior public servants in the government. All the while, we have an inquiry going on in a manner transparent beyond, I believe, any other government's investigation in the aftermath of the Volcker inquiry.Australia alone has established an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. No other government has been willing to do that. And as a result of that inquiry the blame will fall where it may. We have established an inquiry under the chairmanship of an outstanding Australian lawyer. He says clearly that he has ample powers to make findings of fact 'in relation to the behaviour of the Commonwealth'. He does not say 'the public servants'. He does not say 'the WEA'. He says generically 'the Commonwealth'. That includes everybody who is part of the Commonwealth. If he needs additional terms of reference, he will ask for them; and undoubtedly that request will be met.In the light of all of that, this is an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to mislead the Australian people, to assert falsely that there were 10, 12, 13 - what will it be at the weekend: 20? - warnings given to the Australian government. In reality those assertions are falsehoods. I reject them on my own behalf and I reject them on behalf of my government.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, first I would like to join you in saying how pleased I am that Phil Gramm is here. It is good to see a former distinguished senator in this place. I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. As I said in answer to the previous question that I was asked, the Volcker report was issued at the end of last year. It made clear that the oil for food program was administered by the United Nations. On page 28 of volume II in a section entitled 'Management of the Oil-for-Food Program' Volcker said:The contract was forwarded through the company's home country mission to the ...  Contracts Processing and Monitoring Division, where it was subject to review for the details of pricing and value ...... the contract was then subject to the 661 Committee's - that is, of the UN - review and approval ...Upon approval of a goods contracts, the goods could be transported into Iraq.Volcker makes conclusions about the central failings of the United Nations in administering the oil for food program. He says that Benon Sevan, who was the Executive Director of the Office of the Iraq Program, 'failed to maintain and support the officers' responsibilities'. He also said that members of the Security Council and of the 661 Committee 'must shoulder their share of the blame in providing uneven and wavering direction in the implementation of the program'. In a press release Mr Volcker said:The central conclusion of the Volcker Committee was the failures in UN oversight in management.He also said:The need for stronger executive leadership, thoroughgoing administrative reform and more reliable controls and auditing with the UN is understood.I do not think there is much debate - the Secretary-General of the UN would agree with this - that the UN did fail in administering the oil for food program. Kofi Annan, as the Secretary-General, has accepted responsibility for that. Had there been warning signs for the Australian government in the information that the opposition argues are warning signs, then it logically follows that there were warning signs for the other 65 countries who had companies involved in the so-called kickbacks.Yet we were apparently the only country in the world, according to the opposition, which was supposed to have detected those warnings. The fact that the other 65 failed to detect the warnings is all right! We should have been able to detect the warning signs. It simply demonstrates two things. First of all, the opposition do not know how the program worked. Secondly, it is perfectly clear that they have spent a long time making puerile party political points, and I am sure the great public of Australia reject their cheapskate politicking.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can inform her that in 2000 as part of A New Tax System the government introduced the largest tax reform in Australia's history, abolishing wholesale sales tax, bed tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on marketable securities and other taxes in return for the introduction of a uniform rate 10 per cent GST. Every single dollar of that GST goes to state governments. Every single dollar, by legislation, goes to state governments. Since 2000, $150 billion has gone to the state governments of Australia and of this South Australia has received $17.3 billion, including a $402 million windfall over and above what it would have received had it kept the old taxes and had they been adjusted in accordance with the growth. That is the basis of the South Australian economy at the moment, and that is what is underpinning government services in South Australia. So I was concerned to see the member for Makin send me a leaflet, which is now being circulated in South Australia on behalf of the South Australian Labor government, which claims:The federal Liberals are collecting tax revenues and the Rann government keeps delivering quality services.What does it say the tax revenue is that the federal government is collecting? GST. Let me make it clear that every last dollar of GST is being received by state governments and in South Australia in 2005-06 that is $3,394 million. It is projected to be $3,573 million the next year and $3,723 million the year after. This leaflet, which carries disgusting lies, is authorised by one D. Feeney, who I believe is a Victorian Senate candidate. - He is in the anti member for Hotham cabal, in the pro-Conroy faction. I welcome the member for Hotham back today. I hope the doorknocking went very well! It is good to see you, and we hope to see you back here far more often! He is part of the Conroy-Marles-Shorten-Pakula disgusting factional group down there in Victoria and has moved across to South Australia, where he is running leaflets claiming that the federal government collects GST. I call on Premier Rann today to dissociate himself from Mr Feeney, to withdraw that leaflet, to apologise to all South Australians and to not go into an election on the basis of disgusting lies like that.If Mr Rann, the Premier of South Australia, has a shred of honesty, he will have that leaflet withdrawn. I will make another offer. He could leave that leaflet out there and return $3,394 million to the Commonwealth government. We will give him the choice. He can keep the leaflet and send back $3,394 million or he can keep the $3,394 million and get rid of the leaflet. The choice is yours, Mr Rann. How about a bit of honesty in the South Australian elections?</DOC>

 - Without in any way criticising the legal expertise of Mr Walker, which I do not seek to do, the unavoidable reality for the Leader of the Opposition is that Mr Cole QC - whose repute in the legal profession is at least the equal of that of Mr Walker if not, given his greater experience, superior - has made it very plain that he has ample powers to make the relevant findings of fact. He has made it perfectly plain that if he wants additional terms of reference he will ask for them. Both by our response to date and by what I have said, if he asks for wider terms of reference, he will get them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can assure him that this government does not just talk about more medical student places; we are actually delivering more doctors for people right around Australia, particularly in the great state of Queensland. Since 2000 the number of publicly funded first-year medical student places has increased by 30 per cent. By 2011 the number of medical graduates a year will increase from the current level of about 1,300 to 2,100 - that is a 60 per cent increase - thanks to already implemented measures by this government.Premier Beattie persists in claiming that Queensland's doctor shortage is somehow all the federal government's fault, even though the number of medical graduates a year in Queensland has increased by 25 per cent since 1996, even though the Howard government has established three new medical schools in Queensland and even though the number of publicly funded first-year medical student places in Queensland has almost doubled from just over 200 to over 400 since 1996.The problem in Queensland is not so much a shortage of doctors but a shortage of doctors who are prepared to work in hospitals run by the Beattie Labor government. Last year 761 doctors resigned from Queens-land public hospitals in just eight months. That is a 20 per cent staff turnover in just six months. What does it say about the quality of the management of the Queensland public hospital system that in two years they have lost 1,691 from Queensland public hospitals? That is a 40 per cent staff turnover in just two years. That is a disgraceful, appalling result and it is wholly and solely the responsibility of the Beattie Labor government.Premier Beattie says that this does not matter because they have recently appointed some 825 doctors to Queensland public hospitals. So they are replacing experienced doctors with inexperienced doctors and they are replacing Australian trained doctors largely with foreign trained doctors. That certainly does not encourage people to have confidence in the public hospitals of Queens-land. I ask the people of Queensland: who do you trust? Do you trust the Howard government, which is delivering more medical student places, or Premier Beattie? Why would you ever trust a government which has lost 40 per cent of its own public hospital doctors in just two years?</DOC>

 - I do not have direct knowledge of that letter, but I will have a look at it. But let us accept for the purposes of the question that the letter was written. It remains the assertion of Mr Stewart - repeated to me and to my colleagues yesterday - that he was not aware of the matters that are the subject -  -  - Mr Speaker, I have been asked a question. I am precisely responding to the question that was asked. -  - It goes, Mr Speaker, to an orderly investigation of this matter. I know that a lot of evidence against AWB people has been given before the Cole commission, but unless and until the company and all of its officers, including its chairman, its former chairman and its managing directors, and any other directors who may be called, have had an opportunity to give their evidence and until the Cole inquiry has made a finding in relation to these matters, we must respect the process. We are big in this place, when it suits our political purposes - the Labor Party is a good example of this - on saying, 'Let's have a process. Let it be examined.' I know it does not look good at the moment for AWB, but let them have their full day in court. That is what is meant to be the rule of law that governs this place. It is meant to be the rule by which all of us live. Let us have a full laying out of all of the facts before the Cole inquiry, and let this very fine lawyer bring down his findings.The Leader of the Opposition asked me against that background why Mr Brendan Stewart will accompany the Deputy Prime Minister to Iraq. It is for the very simple reason - and I thought the Leader of the Opposition would have understood this; I would have thought it was obvious why he is to accompany us - that AWB Ltd holds the pool. The advice I currently have is that, if you are to sell wheat into Iraq and you are to participate in the latest tender, the only wheat that is available is the wheat legally controlled by AWB Ltd. Unless the Leader of the Opposition is into acquisition of property on unjust terms, unless the Leader of the Opposition is into breaking the Constitution of Australia, we have to deal with the legal holder and controller of that wheat.So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, of all the questions he has asked on this issue, that really is a very silly question to ask. Mr Brendan Stewart is going for that reason. In the delegation there will be representatives of the wheat industry and there may be others who represent the interests that are involved in this issue. But this is a government mission. It will be led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. The purpose of the mission is not to score political points, like the Leader of the Opposition. The purpose of the mission is to look after the Australian wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question, and note his deep interest in schools in his electorate. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that recently I announced the outcome of round 2 for the $1 billion Investing in our Schools Program in the ACT, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Under round 2 for these areas, $36 million has been invested in schools. Under round 1 of the $1 billion Investing in our Schools Program, the Australian government has funded $100 million in 4,040 projects in 2,614 schools across Australia.Let us remember what this program is about. The Australian government is responding to a failure on the part of state and territory governments to adequately maintain schools owned and operated by state and territory governments. That is why $700 million of this billion dollar program is directed to state and territory government schools for basic infrastructure for those schools.This has been an incredibly popular program. Members on this side of the House will recall how excited teachers, parents and students were to be able to get funding for some basic infrastructure needs for their schools. We have been able to provide funding for airconditioning, for shade structures, for toilet blocks - some had not been renovated in 20 or 30 years.The member for Kingston will be delighted with the outcome in his electorate. Over $639,000 was provided to schools in his electorate, and I trust that schools in his electorate will also apply for funding in round 2. I suspect that one of the biggest fans of this program is the member for Jagajaga. She would have been so excited to have been able to announce that 28 Victorian government schools in the electorate of Jagajaga received over $883,000 for basic infrastructure. - See what a fan she is of this billion dollar program on the part of the Howard government! This program is evidence of the Australian government's commitment to ensuring the best outcomes in education for all Australian schools. That is why we are investing $33 billion over the next four years in Australian schools.</DOC>

 - I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, as of now, as I understand it, there has not been evidence presented which directly contradicts the position taken by Mr Stewart - and he is yet to be given his opportunity. I would have thought that ordinary principles of justice entitle that man to be heard. I thought the Labor Party once stood for ordinary principles of justice. I thought the once-great Australian Labor Party believed in the Aussie fair go. I thought the idea was that you were innocent until you were proven guilty. But apparently the Labor Party does not believe in that.I am following the evidence that is being presented to the Cole inquiry very closely, but I intend to withhold judgment until that very learned commissioner, widely respected in Australian legal and corporate circles, has brought down his conclusions. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that AWB Ltd is a public company. I would remind him that many of the shareholders of AWB Ltd are in fact Australian wheat growers. I would further remind him -  - that it is in the interests of Australian wheat growers, being shareholders in AWB Ltd, that the difficult situation in which the company now finds itself is not further aggravated by statements made without any basis in fact. The proper thing to do, the decent thing to do, is the approach that was advocated by a former Labor trade minister before the Senate estimates committee on 23 June 1994 - and I refer to the member for Canberra, I think it was; a former trade minister - when he was asked certain questions in relation to an inquiry, believe it or not, into Centenary House. Do you remember that? This is what he had to say:But this is a matter, I understand, being inquired into by the judicial inquiry and I think it should be left there.And, properly enough, Senator Kemp, on behalf of the then opposition, said:I take your point. I am aware that there is a major inquiry -  - Brendan Stewart is the executive chairman of AWB Ltd. No adverse findings have been made against him by Commissioner Cole. The commission goes on. AWB Ltd is the holder of the wheat pool. If we are to have a satisfactory outcome for the wheat growers of Australia and not some kind of political hit scored by one side or the other in this parliament, if we are really interested in selling wheat to Iraq, we really do need to have the company that owns the wheat involved in some way. It is in fact quite hard to sell wheat that you do not have.Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could sit down and think about that. Here he is, saying: 'Get the wheat into Iraq. Find our market. Save our farmers.' In order to do that, you have to at least deal - at a minimum - on a commercial basis with the holder of the wheat. Doesn't the Leader of the Opposition understand the way in which AWB Ltd is involved? It has acquired the wheat from the wheat growers. Why doesn't he talk to the member for Hotham? He would tell him. Why doesn't he talk to Gavvy over there? He would tell him. They know something about primary industry in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, in order to try and score a political point, is completely losing track of how all this works.We have an inquiry. Let it get on with its job. In the meantime, let the Deputy Prime Minister lead a delegation to Iraq on behalf of Australian wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and I say to the 3½ thousand defence personnel in Townsville that they have no stronger advocate in this country than the member for Herbert. If there is anything in particular that they want me to know, he will transmit that directly to me.The first responsibility of any government is the defence of the country, the defence of Australia. All the people on this side of the House - and, I suspect, former senator Phil Graham - know this only too well. There are two things that are required if you are going to be well equipped to defend your country. The first is that you have to have political will. There has to be a determination to ensure that Defence is well equipped and well ahead of the technological and strategic changes throughout the world. The second thing you need is money.When this government came to office in 1996, 10 years ago, we had at that stage a defence force where only 42 per cent of our troops were combat ready. Today it is 62 per cent. We had a $10.3 billion deficit. We had serious problems with our submarines, given to us by a Labor government. What this government did in consolidating the finances of the country and to make sure that Australia had a strong economy was to make sure that Australia spent less than it earned. But the one area that was not reduced in expenditure at all was defence. At that time, this coalition, the Howard government, transferred through efficiency programs some $900 million from the tail of Defence, from the back-end offices, to the front end of Defence.The government's vision for Defence was set out in a white paper in 2000, and over the 10-year period we committed to spending an extra $28½ billion on defence capability. We have already rolled out an additional $7 billion and that means, in plain language, almost 60 Abrams heavy tanks as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. We are also going to build three Australian air warfare destroyers. We are committed to building and purchasing two amphibious ships, which will carry up to 1,000 troops. We are also committed to 140 defence capability projects as a result of this.This government is also determined to strengthen our Army. In December last year we announced a $1½ billion increased investment in the Australian Army to make sure that it is mobile, that it can protect and that it also has significant fire power - something that the Leader of the Opposition certainly does not have in relation to the member for Hotham or the member for Corio. The one thing that is absolutely certain is that this government, under no circumstances, will be spooked by a political party of Paris Hiltons into doing anything other than making sure that the defence of Australia, the security of our region and the commitment to our international strategic interests are our No. 1 priority.</DOC>

 - I certainly know Mr Trevor Flugge; as indeed do those opposite. Mr Flugge was appointed to the Australian Wheat Board in 1984 by the Hawke government. He was Deputy Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board from 1990 to 1995, presumably an appointment made during the terms of office of both the Hawke and the Keating governments, and he was a director and chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, as it was then known, from 1995 - that would have been under the Keating government - until 2002. I do not disguise for a moment the fact that the government sought the involvement of Mr Flugge in post-Saddam Iraq. I will tell you why we sought his involvement: it was because our principal concern at that time was to stop American wheat growers from getting our markets. - It is about time the member for Griffith understood and recalled his own rhetoric from those days. His own rhetoric in 2002-03 was essentially that the government should get out of the way and leave it all to the AWB. That is what the member for Griffith was saying. - He would have been remunerated. As to the precise amount and the precise source, I will obtain information on that and I will advise the member for Griffith. We are not disguising for a moment the fact that we encouraged the appointment of Mr Flugge. We thought Mr Flugge would fight hard for the Australian wheat industry. I do not remember the opposition saying at the time that it was a bad appointment. In fact, they said the opposite - just as in 2003 he was yelling from the rooftops that Downer and Howard should get out of the way and leave it all to the Australian Wheat Board. That is what he was saying.I go through those press statements with great interest - with great relish. The Labor Party are so hypocritical on this subject. Way back in 2002-03, they would not have a word said against AWB Ltd. Now they invite us to believe that, all along, they knew about it, we knew about it, the alarm bells were ringing and the warning bells were there. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the honourable member that the Indonesian government is set to trial a new air surveillance system developed by Airservices Australia in alliance with the international airline data communications provider, SITA Inc. This trial will involve a new airspace surveillance technology, called Automatic Dependence Surveillance Broadcasting, or ADSB, and it will begin in Indonesia in May 2006. -  - I would have thought honourable members opposite would be rather interested in the safety of air traffic between Australia and Indonesia, but it would seem that their minds are on other things. The reality is that there are about 60,000 flights in and out of Australia and through Australian-Indonesian air space every year. Close to half of those flights are operated by Qantas. There have been concerns about the safety of Indonesian air space management and this, therefore, is a significant step forward. It is sophisticated new technology and it involves aircraft broadcasting their position every second, with the signal being picked up by ground based ADSB receivers and forwarded to air traffic controllers.This technology is particularly well suited to countries with difficult terrain, and it is being assessed with the potential of it being introduced in Australia. We hope, in fact, that Australia will become the first country in the world to introduce this new technology by 2007. It has greater capacity to cover an entire country than the existing radar networks and will undoubtedly improve the management of international airspace.In addition to these initiatives, we are moving close to completing a $1.1 million project focusing on improved screening of passengers at Denpasar and Jakarta airports. We have got three transport specialist security people in Jakarta to work cooperatively with the local people to endeavour to upgrade security arrangements, and our last port of call project will help countries which operate flights into Australia to upgrade their security. That is important not just for the safety of travellers in those countries but also to protect our own skies so that we do not import into this country from a last port of call someone with ill intent to our country. So we are undertaking very significant steps to improve the security and the management of our airspace to our near north. This development of ADSB technology and its introduction in Indonesia is a world first and will make a very significant improvement in the safety of the region.</DOC>

 - I do thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I know of his interest in matters relating to law and order and security. Of course the national security public information campaign has been very successful in raising awareness in the Australian community of the hotline and its role. The fourth and final scheduled burst of advertising for the current campaign will start this Sunday for three weeks. The campaign will feature television, press, transit and outdoor advertising. Of course it is there to remind people of the importance of being vigilant in identifying possible signs of terrorism and to report on any suspicious activity. The hotline is an integral component of our national counter-terrorism arrangements, and a high proportion of calls have provided helpful information in relation to investigations that we are undertaking.I am aware that there was a recent Morgan poll which reported that the overwhelming majority of Australians are aware of the national hotline and its role. That is clearly evident from the fact that 73,300 calls, letters and emails have been received since it commenced operations in 2002. Over half of these have provided information which has been of assistance to security and intelligence authorities as well as police. The number is prominently listed in the White Pages. I hope it is still on some fridges. The number, of course, for all of you, if you do not remember it, is 1800 123 400 - not all that difficult, I might say.It is disappointing that the opposition has sought to deride and undermine the effectiveness of the national security hotline. It is obvious that the Labor Party does not recognise the value of engaging the community in relation to terrorism. I want to assure the House that the government remains committed to protecting the safety and security of Australians and that the national hotline is integral to our national security arrangements.</DOC>

I must confess my inadequacy, in that I do not carry all of that minute detail around in my head. I lack the honourable gentleman's soaring capacity to do that. But I will do my best to find out.What I do happen to have, not in my head but in my hand, is a press release dated 20 August 2002. It was issued by the shadow minister for foreign affairs. It is headed '2003 Wheat sales to Iraq'. It says:The Federal Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the likely resumption of Australian wheat sales to Iraq in 2003. - Let me repeat:The Federal Opposition welcomes the announcement by the Australian Wheat Board on the likely resumption of Australian wheat sales to Iraq ...He then goes on to say:The Opposition congratulates the AWB for achieving a commercial outcome in the midst - listen to this - of the difficult foreign policy environment, which had been delivered to them by Foreign Minister Downer.There is an old saying which I am sure the member for Griffith would be aware of, and that is: would that my enemy would write a book.

 - I welcome the question from the member for Dobell. In this country today we have an incredibly strong economy - a nation where we have too many jobs and not enough people. We have an amazing circumstance and it is such a big contrast to 10 years ago. The demographic changes in the world have fed into the fact that this is a very challenging environment for businesses to attract young people to the enormous and wide range of choices that they have.As a government, we have spent a decade undoing Labor's neglect. The 'recession we had to have' trashed a generation of could-have-been-trained Australians. It trashed 30,000 in one year under the leadership at that time of the member for Brand. In the electorate of Dobell, we had some 2,300 people in training as at June 2005. That is a 211 per cent increase on the number in training in 1995 - and I know the member for Dobell is happy about that. In the publicly funded system today, 1.6 million people are being trained, which is half a million more than in 1995. The system is a world leader, but this government is not happy with that distinction. We can do, we will do and we are doing much more.In June last year, 391,200 people were in training, whereas in 1995 there were 143,790. Over the next four years we will be spending $10.1 billion - nearly $5 billion to the states and $1.4 billion in new incentives. That is the biggest-ever contribution lift to the task of training young Australians from any Australian government in this nation's history. For the Australian technical colleges proposal, there is $343 million for 25 colleges and we will announce soon on the Central Coast of New South Wales the outcome of our negotiations there - and I know the member for Robertson joins with the member for Dobell in being happy about that. There is the Tools for Your Trade Initiative, for which almost 35,000 people are eligible, and there are 42,300 people who are eligible for the trade learning scholarship.Last Friday's COAG saw the Prime Minister's leadership on this issue hit a new height. We are now in an environment where it is no longer just lip-service to but the delivery of recognition of skills across the state boundaries, easier pathways for overseas qualifications to be recognised in this country and, in particular, an end to the 'time served' approach - the concept of 'if you serve for four years, you are suddenly qualified'. We will see a defeat of that and we will see that before the end of the year. In particular, in New South Wales and Western Australia, we will see opportunities for school based apprenticeships as well. -  - Those opposite are interjecting with their complaints and lack of interest in this issue. They would be very wise to look at what Sharan Burrow and the ACTU have said today, where they are supporting the government's efforts on competency based training and reflecting the calls from Australian industry for this to happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for such a wonderful question. Financial literacy is a very important issue to young people in this country. -  - Those opposite might laugh, but last year this federal government made an announcement committing $21 million to help children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 to understand money, the use of money and the peer group pressure that is put on young children in relation to the purchase of mobile phones, the use of text messages and all those things that have the potential to create debt for young people. They cause enormous pressures not just on children but also on parents and families. This government is keen to work with the states to talk through, educate and make children understand the value of money and the acceptance of personal responsibility.This government remains very committed to this program. We are very serious about it. Those opposite might jibe and laugh about it, but this is a serious attempt to help young children who are in very difficult circumstances, some of whom they portray themselves as representing. This is a program that we will continue to roll out to help young people around the country in order to provide them with a better future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest -  -  - The Mallee, I am sorry. I have done it again! I apologise to my esteemed colleague the member for the Mallee for that mistake. Can I say that the member for the Mallee is one of many members - all on this side of the House - who actually know something about the Australian wheat industry. There are a couple on the other side who do, but we may not have them much longer - and I think that will be a great shame.I want to very warmly welcome the announcement made yesterday by the Iraqi government that it will continue to buy Australian wheat. This excellent outcome is due to the visit to Iraq by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I want to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister, very ably supported by Senator Jeannie Ferris, the chairman of the government members' committee on these matters, for the excellent work they have done in very difficult circumstances over the weekend. They should be commended by all Australians who are interested in the future of the wheat industry.In a joint statement released yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Chalabi, the two governments 'reaffirmed their strong desire for the longstanding ... wheat trade to continue into the future'. The statement also said:In this context, the Iraqi Government will continue to welcome offers to supply high-quality Australian wheat through participating in competitive tendering in Iraq. The government will now consider how best to achieve this and we will continue to do all we can to assist Australian wheat farmers to supply wheat to Iraq. This outcome reflects the strong relationship between the two countries, including a very long and fruitful economic relationship, a wheat trade that stretches over half a century, our shared commitment to bringing democracy to this troubled country and Australia's generous contribution of aid and reconstruction following the fall of the former regime.The Deputy Prime Minister went to Iraq with the sole purpose of protecting the interests of Australian wheat growers. I believe that he has risen to that occasion in a very effective way. I thank him and I congratulate him on a very successful mission.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I acknowledge his deep interest in this area and his assistance. The Australian government has commissioned Dick Warburton, Chairman of the Board of Taxation, and Mr Peter Hendy, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to lead a study that will benchmark the Australian taxation system against other developed economies.The benchmarking will look at the overall level of taxes, the tax mix and the base and rates within each type of tax. It will cover personal, business, indirect property and transaction taxes. It will provide a definitive set of facts which will show those areas where Australia meets international practice and those areas where Australia lags behind international practice. Armed with those facts, we will be able to direct our attention to those areas where Australia lags and, in response to that, be able to ensure that the Australian taxation system meets international practice.All of the areas where Australia wants to be at the forefront of economic practice can take advantage from international benchmarking. That is why it is important that we do this in the taxation area just as we have done it in so many other areas - such as the conduct of monetary policy, fiscal policy, competition policy, debt policy and balance sheet management - to add to the reforms which this government has already put in place -  - reforms which the member for Melbourne, so voluble in his interjection, opposed. Every single major reform of the Australian economy was opposed by the member for Melbourne, an old socialist leftie who is trying to get back into this argument. He is not old, sorry; I withdraw that.What is the position of the Australian Labor Party? Blow me down if the Australian Labor Party does not oppose benchmarking the Australian taxation system. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lilley were out yesterday whingeing and whining, opposing again, trying to hold back reform - as they have every other reform of the Australian economy. Need I remind members of the government that this was the man who promised the Australian public the roll-back of the GST. There is a word we do not hear much around here any more. It is the word that begins with 'r'. It is the roll-back policy.Also out there opposing yesterday was the member for Lilley. In the last election it was the member for Lilley who thought up the brilliant campaign of taking $600 off every Australian family. When the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, discovered the night before the policy release - I read from Mr Latham's diaries:The night before the policy release I asked Swan how we deal with the $600 annual payment. He replied, 'Just say it's not real money.' - That was the last tax policy which the member for Lilley put forward - to take $600 off each family in Australia. 'Just tell them it's not real money.' Just tell them he's not a real shadow Treasurer either.</DOC>

 - I do thank very much the member for Greenway for her question and I remind her and all other members that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an essential part of the overall Medicare system delivering lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs to Australians at affordable prices. But the cost of the PBS - currently more than $6 billion a year - has been growing strongly because new medicines have been able to pass rigorous cost effectiveness scrutiny. That is to say that the health benefits they confer or the extra quality of life they deliver more than justify the taxpayer subsidy.Since October 2003 there have been more than 300 new listings, adding some $1 billion to the PBS forward estimates. For instance, in December Arimidex was listed on the PBS for the treatment of breast cancer. This is expected to help up to 24,000 people at a cost of $75 million to 2010. This month Vytorin was listed on the PBS to treat people with serious cardiovascular disease. This is expected to help up to 300,000 Australians at a cost of  $156 million by 2010. In April Raptiva will list on the PBS to treat people with severe chronic psoriasis, which is a horribly disfiguring skin disease. This is expected to help up to 17,000 Australians at a cost of $228 million by 2010.With expenses at this level, obviously the government is always looking at ways to get better value from the PBS, but we certainly will not stint on the drugs that Australians need. The government remains determined to preserve a very strong PBS and to be, as always, the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I know that the honourable member for McPherson and, for that matter, the honourable member for Moncrieff will be delighted with the news that at long last the Tugun bypass will be built. The Tugun bypass project has been in the waiting for years. It is a significant and, I acknowledge, a difficult construction project, which crosses state borders and passes through airport land and significant environmental areas, but, when completed, it will unite around half a million people across the New South Wales-Queensland border in the fast-growing areas around the Gold Coast and the northern parts of New South Wales. Even though this particular project is not a part of the national highway network, the Australian government will provide $120 million towards this 7.5-kilometre project and will help to ensure that the project is able to achieve its objectives of providing much better traffic through those fast-growing areas on the Gold Coast.Last week the Australian government approved the environmental impact statement and the major development plan for the Gold Coast airport, which clears the way for the project to commence. The road will pass under the extension of the Gold Coast airport, and significant work will be required to ameliorate environmental issues. It is one of the most complex assessments that the Department of the Environment and Heritage has undertaken for a very long time, but it now gives the opportunity for this really important project to proceed and to get rid of some of those appalling bottlenecks that travellers through the Gold Coast have had to endure for quite some time.The Queensland government has complained that it does not get enough money from the Australian government for roads. It is overlooking the fact that an 81 per cent increase in construction funding has been provided to Queensland under AusLink and that AusLink funding has enabled projects like the Tugan bypass to proceed. Queensland will receive $1,864 million for road funding under AusLink in the period 2004 to 2008-09, including $1½ billion for construction. This is an important example of the government getting on with the job of delivering the road network that the fast-growing parts of south-east Queensland so urgently need.</DOC>

 - I thank the member opposite for his question and for his warm welcome. I say in response, though, that there was no need to follow on from such a stupid question as the member for Lilley put before. This smacks of desperation by a desperate leader and a desperate opposition in relation to the Cole inquiry. - The member opposite is aware that the Commissioner of Taxation is an independent person. He has the capacity to undertake investigations in relation to deductions that may or may not have been claimed by a private company. They are matters that quite rightly remain within his domain. Currently it is not within the law -  - I would conclude by saying that there is no capacity under Australian law for a company to claim a deduction for a payment that is considered to be a bribe in another country. The opposition knows that and the member opposite knows that. The fact is that they are running around on this issue desperate, because the Labor Party under Kim Beazley is going nowhere.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. The person mentioned, Joseph 'Jack' Thomas, is the first person to be charged with and convicted for specific offences under the counter-terrorism laws passed by this parliament in 2002. He is yet to be sentenced and it would be inappropriate to go into the details of the case.I might say that there have been a number of comments on this matter by his representatives which, in the context of their role as officers of the court, I thought quite surprising. An awareness of the fact that we have a conviction for a serious terrorism offence - and that is the case - and a conviction for another offence relating to altering aspects of a passport document, an awareness of the fact that a magistrate saw fit to ensure that a person was put to his trial when the matter was brought before the magistrate and where, at the trial, the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt that applies to criminal standards applied and an awareness of the fact that Mr Thomas was found not guilty in relation to those two separate offences does not in any way detract from the fact that there was a conviction for a serious criminal offence. To suggest that this was some form of trophy trial is quite inappropriate. To suggest that this case demonstrates that people of Muslim faith should not cooperate with authorities is, I think, quite inappropriate for an officer of the court.What this case demonstrates very clearly is that, if you get involved with terrorists and their activities, you do so at your own peril. There are laws that deal with these issues and the government is committed to ensuring that we do everything in our power, both domestically and internationally, to counter the terrorist threat to our people. We want to ensure their safety and their security, and I am pleased that this matter has been resolved properly in accordance with the law. There was no basis upon which his legal representatives should have brought that process into question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Last Tuesday the Prime Minister and I announced that the Australian government will be deploying another 200 troops to Afghanistan. This will be under the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force phase III. The Australian troops will be working in team with Dutch troops. The Dutch have advised that they will be making available up to 1,400 troops for this task. The Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force has just returned from London and the Netherlands to commence the negotiations for the precise detail of the deployment.About half of the 200 troops that we will send will be, specifically, engineers and tradespeople who will be working in the Oruzgan province of Afghanistan. This is a highly dangerous activity. About half of the deployment will be security forces and logistics support, and we envisage that the deployment will be for a two-year period. These will add to the 200 special forces troops that we already have in Afghanistan and the 110 currently being deployed along with two Chinook helicopters, into which has been invested an additional $25 million to improve their antiballistic capabilities. I know the member for Herbert, along with all Australians, will wish them every success in this.The reason the government is committed to deploying these troops is that terrorism is a global activity. It is likely for the foreseeable future that free men and women in governments throughout the world will be fighting terrorism. It needs to be fought in distant parts of the world no less than it needs to be fought in our region or, indeed, within Australia.On Saturday we welcomed home the special forces task operation group, which has returned from Afghanistan. In the presence of the Prime Minister, the representative of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Chris Evans, and other MPs, including the member for Cowan, the troops were recognised and honoured for their action, their leadership and their bravery on our behalf. Two in particular, a sergeant and a warrant officer class 2, were awarded the Medal for Gallantry, which is the third highest honour that can be bestowed upon an Australian soldier for bravery. In honour of those men and their families, I table an edited precis of what they have achieved.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Weekend reports of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, on a poultry farm in France are alarming because it is the first case of the deadly disease in domestic fowl in the European Union. This is in addition to 17 other European countries that have reported the H5N1 virus. The Director-General of the World Organisation for Animal Health, Dr Bernard Vallat, has stated that the H5N1 virus is now so endemic in migratory wildfowl that it is certain to spread to almost every country in the world. The only possible exceptions, he said, were Australia and New Zealand.Late last year the Australian government coordinated Exercise Eleusis, to test Australia's ability to respond to a simulated outbreak of the avian influenza in poultry. Our response arrangements proved to be effective and sound. A detailed report is currently being prepared and will include a number of recommendations to further strengthen our preparation. Australia recognises the risk posed by migratory birds. However, the vast majority of birds coming to Australia are shore birds and not waterfowl, which have been responsible for the spread of H5N1 in other parts of the world. Nevertheless, surveillance of migratory birds is vital to Australia's protection from a bird flu outbreak. To date, more than 10,000 samples have been collected from wild birds but show no signs of the virus. In addition, the quarantine service has completed further surveys specifically for that pathogenic avian influenza as part of a surveillance program across Australia's north. At the same time, surveys are undertaken throughout Australia's south. Farmers, wildlife networks and agricultural departments across Australia are also alert to report any suspicious deaths.In summary, although naturally we can never guarantee immunity from H5N1, all Australians will be confident that research, surveillance, monitoring and planning currently in place are providing Australia with the best possible chance of protection.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I can indicate to him that last week the Prime Minister and I launched a series of seminars which will be held throughout Australia which highlight, particularly for the business community in Australia, the publication Workforce tomorrow. This publication summarises research which shows that in the space of just five years Australia could face a workforce shortage of up to 195,000 people because of the ageing of the population. The ageing of the population, the health of the economy and the government's previous workforce relations reforms have contributed to a 30-year low in unemployment and a demand for labour which in many regions exceeds supply. We see this in particular in regional areas of Australia. As part of the response, the government has also met this demand through skilled migration.I note in this regard that yesterday on the Sunday program the Leader of the Opposition criticised the government for importing '270,000 skilled migrants' since 1996. I ask: what is the Leader of the Opposition's policy to deal with skill shortages? Does he oppose skilled migration to this country or is this merely an attempt on the part of the Australian Labor Party to engage in some sort of xenophobic sentiments about skilled migrants? This is significant because in November last year, in the discussion of a matter of public importance in this chamber, the Leader of the Opposition said that Australian children would:... find themselves dispensed with as apprentices, as foreigners are brought into this country, prepared to work for virtually nothing as apprentices ...That was what the Leader of the Opposition said last November. Last week the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, warned that the immigration department was planning to 'bring in Chinese workers who will work at whatever wages the company really dictates'. This sounds disturbingly like the rhetoric of the union campaigns in Australia in the 1890s. Let us look at the facts around the trade skills training visas for apprentices, because they do not take apprenticeships from Australian workers. Firstly, they are only available in regional areas where there is a skills shortage. Secondly, there must be a relevant regional certification body to certify that a vacancy cannot be filled locally and that there is a skills shortage in that particular occupation in the region. On top of that, the regional certification bodies in most cases are actually state government bodies. We happen to have Labor state governments in Australia.Here we have a response to an issue identified by Labor state governments wanting to do something responsible about ensuring that there are actually jobs and businesses that continue to thrive, particularly in regional areas of Australia. The government is getting on with the job of creating employment opportunities and continuing to develop the Australian economy. What we hear from the Leader of the Opposition is simply xenophobic dog whistling to his mates in the union movement - that is, the same union movement that gave us the White Australia Policy.</DOC>

 - Yesterday, I can inform the member for Boothby, I launched the government's Family Law Violence Strategy. This strategy will increase the understanding of how the family law system handles allegations of violence, through new research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Under the strategy the government will work, as we should, closely with states and territories to achieve a faster investigation of allegations of violence and abuse. I am concerned that allegations raised in the family law proceedings are not receiving the priority they deserve from many of the state Labor governments and territory agencies that are responsible for investigating them. An allegation being raised in a separation does not make it any less of a priority to be investigated. The strategy also involves working with the courts to improve court processes for handling allegations. The government's family law reforms will make protection from violence one of two primary factors to consider in a court in separation cases.Despite the public attacks on the government's handling of domestic violence issues, I must say I am very disappointed that the honourable member for Gellibrand is trying to undo this change in some of her proposed amendments. I noticed yesterday that the member for Gellibrand claimed credit for the fact that this strategy is now being announced. She seems to think gestation takes only a matter of weeks! The fact is that preparation of the strategy does involve a good deal more cooperation and discussion than the honourable member seems to suggest. I notice also that she seems to be reminiscing. She reminisces over the Labor Party's family law amendments of 1995. I would like to know where the Labor Party stands in relation to these matters in 2006, not 1995. The fact is that the member for Gellibrand, who seems to be obsessed with the past, needs to bring before this parliament a detailed statement of where the Labor Party stands on these matters or to get out of the road and let the government get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I do not know; I will have to check that. But let me tackle the very foundation of the question. I would have thought that, as a student of history, the Leader of the Opposition would see as absolutely absurd the proposition that, when a dictatorial regime is removed, no single official who was a member of the ruling party of the time should ever be left in a position of authority. It never happened in Germany. To my knowledge, it never happened in Japan. The Leader of the Opposition, equally as a student of history, will know that it was a condition of having a job in Saddam Hussein's Iraq that you were a member of the Baath Party. The whole basis of this question is absurd. Of course, I will find out precisely when some notice in relation to this matter was communicated to the government and who it was. I will endeavour to help the Leader of the Opposition. But can I say, with the very greatest of respect, to the Leader of the Opposition: the question is based on an absurd proposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and note his deep interest in this matter. Members will recall that recently the Prime Minister announced that we would lift the cap on full fee paying places for medicine from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. This meant, effectively, that up to 400 more students would have the opportunity to study medicine each year. Members will also recall that COAG embraced this initiative most enthusiastically. All Labor state premiers supported this, particularly Queensland Premier Beattie.The ink was barely dry on the COAG minutes before the member for Jagajaga rushed out and said that Labor would oppose the lifting of the cap, thereby denying up to 400 more students the opportunity to study medicine, and that she would move to disallow the instrument once it reached parliament. The matter came as a great surprise to many in the Labor Party, not the least being the Premier of Queensland, who was stunned to find that his initiative was going to be rolled by the member for Jagajaga. But it seems that there were others who were equally surprised, particularly the Labor frontbench. In an article - and I thank the Australian for this - published on 22 February, entitled 'Macklin set to be rolled on fees', it seems that the member for Lalor was not very happy with the member for Jagajaga. She said in no uncertain terms that the member for Jagajaga had to be put in her place. She said:'The only body that can determine this is federal caucus ...'Currently there is not a federal Labor Party position on this matter.'Apparently, it has emerged that the member for Jagajaga did not consult the frontbench - she did not consult caucus - before signalling that she would oppose Premier Beattie's plan.We have to ask: who is going to win on this one - the member for Jagajaga, who is opposing the opportunity for up to 400 students to study medicine, or the member for Lalor, who says she had no right to say that in the first place? While Labor caucus squabbles over this one, I will assist them. I now table the instrument to lift the cap from 10 to 25 per cent. The clock starts ticking now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question, and I can inform him that the balance of payment for the December quarter of 2005 was released today. The current account deficit widened slightly, by $0.8 billion, to be $14.45 billion. This mainly reflects a widening in the net income deficit, which increased by $0.7 billion, and this is being driven by high profits earned by foreign owned Australian based companies, particularly those in the mining sector. The trade deficit was largely unchanged. There was a welcome increase in exports of around 4.1 per cent, due largely to a strong rise in metal ores, and a 3.9 per cent rise in imports which offset that, driven by increases in capital goods import, particularly civil aircraft, which is a volatile series. The terms of trade rose 2.1 per cent and are now 13.3 per cent higher through the year, at their highest level since the March quarter of 1974.Australia's net foreign debt increased to $473 billion in the December quarter. Nearly all of that comprises private debt. The general government share of net foreign debt has fallen sharply since the coalition came to office. It is now 4.6 per cent, down from 17.2 per cent in March 1996. Australia's ability to service its net foreign debt has also improved. The debt servicing ratio fell to 9.1 per cent in the December quarter, well below the peak of 20 per cent in the September quarter of 1990.There are a number of reasons we can expect an improvement in the current account deficit in the near future. ABARE's latest crop report forecasts winter crop production upgraded to 40.6 million tonnes, and Australia's mining industry has invested around $31.6 billion in the expansion of productive capacity. With rural exports recovering, with the very, very high terms of trade and particularly with the buoyancy of minerals exports, we would expect through the course of the year the trade deficit to narrow. Given those matters, Australia cannot afford to be complacent about its current account deficit. A lot of that represents borrowing, and whilst the business sector is borrowing to invest in new capacity - something that is good for the economy - it is important that the Australian government save, because it is the only sector that is saving at the moment and therefore adding to national savings or, conversely, detracting from the growth of debt. It is important in these circumstances that Australia maintain a strong fiscal position - the fiscal position which the government has set out.</DOC>

 - I believe that the government did. The question, though, asked by the Leader of the Opposition is clearly something in relation to matters of fact on which Commissioner Cole will make a judgment. I therefore say, in relation to my own belief, it is my belief that the government responded competently, but unusually in this situation we have an independent adjudication. I remind the Leader of the Opposition: I lead the only government in the world that has been prepared to establish an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. -  - I am the only one. They do not like it, Mr Speaker, but it happens to be true. The earnest tones and grave of the opposition indicate they do not like it, but it is true. I repeat: I believe that the government behaved competently. The commissioner has said he has the power to make a finding of fact in relation to the behaviour of the Commonwealth; and, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, that includes ministers as well as departments. Let the blame fall where it may.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his interest. By raising this question he is, as usual, assiduously representing the interests of the good people of the electorate of Barker, which is adjacent to the electorate of Mayo. The Prime Minister set up the Cole inquiry in response to the request by the Secretary-General of the United Nations that national authorities take action against companies in their jurisdictions which have been named in a negative way in the Volcker report.To put that into some perspective: over 2,000 companies from 66 countries, including Australia, were named in the Volcker report. Leaving Australia aside, many of the 65 other countries have taken no action whatsoever. Of those that have, most have simply referred the Volcker allegations to investigative authorities. There are two exceptions: one is India, which has had - I think is still having - a closed door inquiry; and South Africa has just established an inquiry, which has not yet got under way. As the Prime Minister has just said, no country has set up a transparent inquiry with the powers of what we call a royal commission in the way that the Australian government has done.During his meeting with the Australian Deputy Prime Minister the day before yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Dr Chalabi, praised the Australian government's decision to establish the Cole inquiry. It was a clear appreciation by the Iraqi government of what Australia has been doing. By the way, Dr Chalabi made the point, as the Prime Minister of Iraq and others have made on occasions, that they are delighted with the contribution this government made to get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime, and they appreciate the ongoing work of the Australian Defence Force.Interestingly enough, the Wall Street Journal, which I would have thought is an extraordinarily credible newspaper and which is read all the way round the world, praised the Australian government recently for establishing the Cole inquiry. This is what the article said:But the good news is that - Australia - has had the nerve to sort the wheat from the chaff - and do it publicly_            _            _ 
Opposition members - Oh! - You are easy to amuse. It goes on:It's striking how Australia has been one of the few countries to have pushed the oil-for-food investigations to the extent of examining its own role.I believe Commissioner Cole is doing a very thorough and a very good job, and we will have to wait and see what conclusions he draws. All sorts of evidence has been brought forward. That is interesting, but we want to find out when it has been tested what is right and what is wrong, and Commissioner Cole will do that.While others are praising the work of Cole and waiting for its report, the Leader of the Opposition has gone out and said that the government is corrupt. In recent days he has sunk to even newer lows. He has allowed shadow ministers to slur the reputation of one of the most honourable people ever to sit in this parliament - the member for Gwydir. He has gone on television attacking departmental officers because apparently, at some point, those departmental officers worked within the offices of ministers and shadow ministers. Yesterday he allowed the member for Wills - I heard it on AM this morning after I got back from Jakarta - to ridicule Trevor Flugge because he has a hearing defect. I thought this parliament had got over the fact that people with hearing defects should not be ridiculed. - Certainly not. I make the serious point that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was once before the Leader of the Opposition, used to trade on the basis that he may not be very competent and hardworking but at least he is a decent bloke. He has abandoned all standards of decency through this debate.</DOC>

 - That is the so-called 'Canadian' cable. - It is the so-called Canadian cable. It is based upon complaints originally made by the Canadians. The Canadians, be it remembered by this parliament, are competitors against Australia for Iraq's wheat imports. Sometimes I think some of these characters, instead of being members with particular electorates, are the senior senator from Manitoba or Iowa rather than being concerned about the representations of the Australian wheat industry.Let me go to the substance of the allegations that were raised in this cable. I point out that on 13 January the reporting cable clearly shows that the United Nations mission - that is, the Australian Mission in the United Nations - referred the matter back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for advice as soon as the Canadian initiated complaint had been raised with the United Nations. I am advised that DFAT contacted AWB Ltd, who categorically denied the allegations. 
Opposition members - Oh! - It is easy, six years after the event, to say, 'Oh!' But I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that three years later his colleague the member for Griffith was saying to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: 'Get out of the way and leave it all to AWB Ltd. AWB is a paragon of virtue and competence in which we invested our entire faith and our entire hope.'Let me resume the answer to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I am advised that DFAT contacted AWB Ltd, who categorically denied the allegations. In March of that same year, the United Nations query about Canadian allegations and on AWB contract terms was resolved to the United Nations' satisfaction. - A query is raised, so what do we do? Roll over because one of our competitors says we are bad? We roll over, according to the Leader of the Opposition. That is not my idea of protecting the national interest. I repeat: in March the UN query about Canadian allegations and on the AWB contract terms was resolved to the UN's satisfaction after the provision by the AWB of its contract terms and conditions. And importantly - and I emphasise this - the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program, which had raised the complaint in the first place at the instance of the Canadians, indicated that this had removed any grounds for misperceptions. That was the response. In those circumstances, I rest on my claim that we responded correctly.</DOC>

 - It takes someone from this side of the House to show any interest in this issue in question time. I think I am right in saying that in 10 years I have never been asked a question by the opposition on this issue. I do not think so. I will stand corrected if I am wrong, but I do not think I ever have been asked a question by the opposition on this subject. I thank the honourable member for his question. Illegal fishing has been increasing in Australia's northern waters. Action has been taken against some 607 foreign vessels in 2005, compared to 289 in 2004. Obviously, illegal fishing in Australian waters is damaging to Australia's fishing industry, as well as to our environmental policies and our marine environment, and it raises quarantine, immigration and security risks.Many of the vessels, but not all of them, are from Indonesia and we are working with the Indonesians to meet this common challenge. Yesterday, while I was in Jakarta with my colleague, friend and counterpart Hassan Wirajuda, we discussed the possibility of establishing joint naval patrols between Australia and Indonesia. I think that to establish joint naval patrols - not just our own navy patrolling the area, but doing it jointly with the Indonesians - would be a very effective deterrent to illegal fishing. It would send a very strong message not just about Australia confronting Indonesia over this issue. I think it is a good way of doing it, making sure there is a shared commitment to addressing the problem. I know that the Minister for Defence is working on ways that we can implement this policy and will be working with his Indonesian counterpart as well.This is on top of us launching a campaign in fishing communities in Indonesia to ensure that Indonesians understand that transgressing Australian waters is illegal and, importantly, brings with it penalties. We are introducing, which I think is a very important thing to do, a joint study of illegal fishing in South-East Asia - in particular, because we have concern about the catching of sharks for shark fin being a real incentive for illegal fishing - to ensure that we all understand much better than, frankly, we do at the moment the regional shark business so that we can take measures to counter what is going on on illegal vessels.I think the government is devoting a lot of resources to this issue. We need to work closely with the Indonesians. I was yesterday very impressed by the very constructive approach that my friends and colleagues in Indonesia took to this issue, recognising that it was a shared responsibility and that the best way of dealing with it is by working together.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform him and the House that ABARE today released their Australian commodities publication and, according to ABARE, earnings from Australia's commodity exports are forecast to increase 25 per cent to around $125 billion in 2005-06, export earnings from mineral and energy resources are forecast to rise 36 per cent to $93 billion and the value of farm exports is forecast to be $28 billion in 2005-06. As I said earlier, Australia now has the strongest terms of trade that it has had since 1974. In those circumstances it is important that we bear in mind that a terms of trade boom will not last forever, that we cannot take permanent decisions on the back of temporary movements in terms of trade and that at periods like this, as has been found in Australian history, it is important to have experienced and consistent economic management.It is not just the government that believes experienced management is necessary. This is also a view which is shared by the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition was asked on ABC Radio on 3 March 2005 about this and he said:I've been around for a very long time, longer than Simon Crean and longer than anyone else, and I don't feel like being pensioned off, thanks. I appreciate having a bit of experience around balancing the youth.We would agree that having the experience of the member for Hotham around is something that certainly adds to the opposition. But at the very time when the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges the importance of experience, he has the member for Hotham lined up in Victoria, he has the member for Corio lined up in Victoria and he has the member for Maribyrnong, who today has announced that he has withdrawn from preselection in the seat of Maribyrnong. He has withdrawn because, as he said:A series of sleazy deals means that even with very strong local support, it is now almost impossible for me to win preselection ...'A series of sleazy deals'! The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, promised that if he was elected he would 'ease the squeeze'. This Leader of the Opposition does not want to ease the squeeze; he wants to ease the sleaze. Worse than that, he wants to grease the sleaze - grease the sleaze in Maribyrnong, grease the sleaze in Corio, grease the sleaze in Hotham. He stands back as if this has nothing to do with him even though he was telling ABC Radio that he wanted experience. How is it that he wanted experience back in 2005 but he does not now want experience? The answer came down on 6PR recently. Listen to this. This is what 6PR reported recently:Opposition leader Kim Beazley's made an extraordinary admission regarding Labor's fitness to govern. He ... says he seriously doubted whether the Opposition frontbench was up to the job when he returned to the leadership 12 months ago.But - Mr Beazley says he's since changed his mind and now believes his Shadow Ministers are capable of running the country.Shadow minister the member for Corio, shadow minister the member for Maribyrnong, shadow minister the member for Hotham - he is standing by whilst he lets the sleaze of the Victorian Labor Party run them out of their seats. These are the people he believes are up to running the country! Mr Speaker, how could he have come to that view? Listen to this. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said: -  - He said:... coming back from a period of three years on the back bench -  -  - He said this, Mr Speaker:... coming back from a period of three years on the back bench and not having had a good look at what they were doing, I wasn't sure about that at the time. Now, I am ... They are fit and ready for government.Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that if they were fit and ready for government you would be standing by your shadow ministers in their preselection. You would be standing by the member for Maribyrnong, you would be standing by the member for Corio, you would be standing by the member for Hotham - and the reason you don't is you are beholden to the sleaze of the Victorian Labor Party and the war lords who direct you.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise her particular advocacy for regional aviation. In fact, she is probably the only person in this House to have an aircraft named in her honour, and it is a thoroughly deserved recognition.The Australian government is committed to growing and expanding international aviation. We have worked very hard to improve the services in and out of Australia, and that has achieved real dividends. We have had record numbers of passengers in and out and a record number of seats available to and from Australia, and that has been achieved against the background of events like SARS and September 11, which certainly sent shock waves through international travel.The government will be continuing to pursue these objectives in reaffirming and expanding our policy in relation to international aviation. We have declared our recognition of the importance of open skies as an aspirational goal, the need to negotiate air services ahead of demand and the importance of maintaining our access to key aviation hubs around the world. We have also, though, recognised the important contribution that an Australian based aviation industry makes to the economy. It is a balanced policy that looks to achieve the very best for our country.In relation to the US-Australia route - about which there has been a lot of controversy over recent times - it is important to note that there is already significant competition potentially available on that route, with scores of airlines having the right to operate it if they choose. Many have tried and failed, but there is still significant competition available on that route. The interest of two Australian airlines, Virgin Blue and Jetstar, in entering the route opens up the potential for real competition with a different type of product than that which might have been available under some of the other options that were under consideration.The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative policies. In spite of the fact that there has been debate going on for years about the trans-Pacific route, the opposition put out a statement just two weeks before the government announced its policy in relation to this issue. Their policy is, 'Federal Labor is open-minded on air route liberalisation.' They had no policy; a complete vacuum. The Leader of the Opposition is now talking about his big target policy and how he is going to lead in these sorts of issues, but when it comes to aviation, they are 'open-minded'; they have not made up their mind.What about when it comes to keeping jobs in heavy maintenance work in Australia? The opposition gives lip-service to wanting Qantas to maintain its heavy maintenance activities in Australia but as we speak the very workers whose jobs are at risk are on strike. They are invading the Melbourne domestic terminal and demonstrating to their employer that they cannot be relied upon to do the job when it matters.If we want to maintain these jobs in Australia, and this government certainly does - we want these skills to be developed and maintained in Australia - then the workforce also has a role to play. Going out on strike in the very weeks when Qantas are making key decisions is sending a very wrong message to the Qantas board. I call upon the workers to play their role in negotiating appropriate arrangements which would allow these thousands of jobs, critical jobs for Australia, to remain in this country.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Griffith for the question because this is the first time I have been asked a question on this issue this year. I very much appreciate the opportunity to say something about it. The honourable member raises the question of the cable of 13 January and selectively quotes from it. I note that this cable reports allegations that had been made not by the United Nations but - as we subsequently discovered, but which we did not know at that time - by the Canadian Wheat Board, who were of course competitors of the Australian Wheat Board.The second observation I would make is that, if you read the whole cable - and the reason the opposition has these cables is that they were tabled in the Cole inquiry today - you will see that the last paragraph says: 'The Office of the Iraq Program,' the OIP, 'noted it had no way -  - of judging the accuracy or otherwise of the claims the Iraqi Grains Board is alleged to have made about AWB,' and so it goes on. There was not a suggestion from the United Nations office of Iraqi programs that this allegation was accurate, just that the allegation had been made. Subsequently, this allegation was checked out on several occasions. First of all it was checked out, and that is of course referred to in one of the other cables tabled today, but subsequently the United Nations office of Iraqi programs asked for specific documentation from the Australian Wheat Board, through the Australian government - documentation which got to the heart of contracts that the allegations suggested might have been rorted.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, if I may say so, with some difficulty obtained these additional contracts that had not previously been provided to the United Nations which the United Nations wanted in order to establish the veracity of these claims that had been made by the Canadians. These contracts were finally obtained by the department from AWB Ltd and given to the United Nations, who studied the contracts and concluded that these allegations that had been made against AWB Ltd, as referred to in these cables which were tabled in the Cole commission today, were unfounded.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and I point out to her that support for private health insurance has been one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to measures such as the private health insurance rebate, almost nine million Australians enjoy the added security and choice that private cover brings, including one million earning less than $20,000 a year. No-one likes price rises, but I point out that the annual average private health insurance price rise has been 5½ per cent since 1996. It was 11 per cent a year during the term of the former Labor government.Without the rebate, which the Labor Party wants to abolish, the average Australian family would be paying nearly $1,000 a year more for their private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition described the private health insurance rebate as a boondoggle in one of his less verbose moments. We had the member for Lalor cook up Medicare Gold as a secret deal to destroy the rebate. Labor's old guard hate the rebate, and so do the union hacks who are now seeking to take their places. We have the AWU and Mr Bill Shorten, the future member for Maribyrnong and the self-styled next Labor Prime Minister, the self-styled Messiah of the Labor Party. He says the rebate is a 'subsidy to the rich'. We have the NUW's Martin Pakula. If the ACTU website is any guide, he thinks the rebate 'drains resources from public hospitals and undermines bulk-billing'.Mr Pakula may be very appealing to Cambodian-speaking people, who are just two per cent of the electorate of Hotham but 30 per cent of the Labor preselectors of Hotham. What about the 42 per cent of the electors of Hotham who have private health insurance? I read in the Australian last Friday that he still has the Greek branches but he has lost the Spanish branches, the Vietnamese branches as well as the Cambodian branches. I could not help but think, 'Are there any Australians left in the so-called Australian Labor Party today?' -  - Mr Speaker, if it would assist the member for Grayndler I am happy to withdraw anything that is giving him offence, but I say this: I think the Australian people are entitled to reject the way the Australian Labor Party constantly put people into ethnic ghettos. That is what they are trying to do to people. We should have Australian branches in Australian political parties -  - I just want to point out that to his great credit, the embattled current member for Hotham does support private health insurance. -  - I was saying that, to his great credit, the current member for Hotham does support private health insurance. When he was the leader, he said: 'I accept that families have factored into their budgets the cost of private health insurance and I am not going to disadvantage them.' Well, good on the member for Hotham. In fact, it is precisely because of these sorts of attitudes towards private health insurance that I am sure his friend the member for Batman said:Simon Crean is the most honest and sincere leader of any political party in the last 50 years.I beg to differ. There have been more honest and more sincere leaders of some political parties in the last 50 years. After listening to what the Leader of the Opposition has said today, I certainly think the member for Hotham is the best leader Labor has had in the last five years.</DOC>

 - Again, I thank the honourable member for his questions - two in a row on this topic - and I appreciate that enormously. Yes, this is another one of the cables that have been tabled today in the Cole commission. The 11 March cable, which is from Austrade back to Canberra, is about the same issue. It is not a separate issue; it is the same allegation made by, as it turned out - I said earlier the Canadian Wheat Associates; that was a mistake - the Canadian Wheat Board. It is the same issue. I made this point earlier: in order to round off their investigation, the United Nations wanted access to contracts that they had not had access to in the past. Why AWB Ltd had not passed them those contracts, I do not know. That is the sort of thing that will be considered by the Cole inquiry, as indeed will all of this. But what I do know is that, through this period, the department was quite assiduous in making sure that it furnished the United Nations - which was responsible for the administration of the oil for food program - investigators with the material they asked for. I made the point earlier, by the way, and it is quite an important point, that AWB Ltd was a little reluctant initially to provide the department with these documents to pass on to the UN. -  - Members may laugh. They may think: 'We all know why now.' We certainly did not know then. Subsequent to this cable of 11 March, that information was obtained - you can see in the reporting of this cable; it tells the story quite clearly - and it was given to the United Nations. The United Nations read those contracts and said that, as a result of that, the matter was closed. Whilst at the time of the conversation in Washington, reported in the 11 March cable, the matter had not been closed according to the United Nations, when DFAT subsequently obtained the information they wanted, the United Nations closed the matter.I would have thought that the allegation that departmental officers of DFAT, me - the minister - the Minister for Trade and the Prime Minister had all been negligent was the exact reverse to what these cables showed, that people were assiduous in following up inquiries, obtaining information and ensuring that these matters were investigated to the fullest extent possible. Of course, if the opposition had had its way, it would have left the oil for food program in place indefinitely, along with its friend Saddam Hussein.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and acknowledge his concern about this issue. Members of the House will recall that the Prime Minister announced we had a plan to lift the cap on full fee paying medical places from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. - In the case of the University of Queensland this would mean 60 extra students could study medicine -  - and these are in addition to the HECS places. - Yesterday we learned that a struggle has broken out between the member for Jagajaga - who opposes this plan to increase the number of medical places for up to 400 students each year - and the member for Lalor, who thinks that she spoke out of turn and was out of line. That is a fight I would like to see televised. Today we learned that other members of the Labor frontbench also believe that the member for Jagajaga is way out of line. We have the member for Hunter, the member for Barton, the member for Batman -  -  - I was pointing out that a number of those on the Labor frontbench believe that the member for Jagajaga is way out of touch. We have the member for Batman, the member for Wills, the member for Hunter and the member for Barton. The very wise and very experienced member for Hotham also supports this plan. How many other members of the Labor frontbench - you are smiling - or the backbench would rather support a plan that was embraced by all state Labor premiers: Mike Rann, Paul Lennon, Steve Bracks, Morris Iemma, Clare Martin and Jon Stanhope? They all support this plan. But, once again, federal Labor have taken the soft political option and they are bailing out the member for Jagajaga. Member for Brand, this is not about saving the member for Jagajaga; it is about building a sustainable health workforce. Yesterday, I tabled the instrument that would enable us to increase the number of medical places in Australian universities. The clock is still ticking.</DOC>

 - I am not sure that the last cable was sent to my office; it actually went to Dr Calvert, the secretary of the department. The others would have been sent to my office and of course I would have read them. I have explained already that I was perfectly satisfied with the response of the department to these inquiries. - The point I make about the opposition is this: what we have been able to expose through your questioning today is that we have a completely clear explanation for all of this material. The material has come forward as a result of the Cole inquiry, which we established in order to get to the heart of the matter. And, what is more, if it had not been for the efforts by the government to not only cooperate with Volcker and establish the Cole inquiry but also contribute to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein then the oil for food program would simply be continuing. Cables that are repeated to my office are repeated to my office. Although about 130,000 cables come to my office a year, they are certainly drawn to my attention, particularly ones which have particular significance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his interest in this subject. Yesterday in this place the Leader of the Opposition said that the Labor Party had 'received the odd contribution from the trade union movement'. Of course, since 1996 that 'odd contribution' has added up to almost $50 million. Indeed, in Victoria that 'odd contribution' from the unions has amounted to some $11.6 million. - This is very interesting in the context -  - of these three sitting frontbenchers who are being challenged for preselection by three more union officials. The reality is that the power basis of these three challengers is entirely predicated upon branch stacking, union links, slush funds and sleazy deals between them, which freeze out ordinary members of the Australian Labor Party.We had confirmation of this this morning when the member for Maribyrnong said on radio 3AW in Melbourne that it was almost impossible for him to win preselection, thanks to a series of what he calls 'sleazy internal deals' - confirmation from the member for Maribyrnong. We have had luminaries of the Labor Party speak out about this: people like John Cain, a former Premier of Victoria; Barry Jones, a former minister in a Labor government and a former president of the ALP; and, of course, John Button, a very distinguished former senator for the ALP. Mr Button said this recently:... Simon Crean when he was leader took the step of trying to implement a very small number of the recommendations which were advocated by Bob Hawke and Neville Wran in their proposals to reform and make more democratic the Labor Party in Australia. He took that step.But John Button went on to say:Now, that doesn't suit certain people because they're not interested in democratic parties. They're more interested in manipulating positions of power and branch stacking and things like that, which produce that power.We saw this in a report in the Weekend Australian newspaper on 26 November last year, which reported on the fact that Bill Shorten and Martin Pakula had met 'in a secret location in northern Melbourne'. The report went on to say:A swag of state seats as well as seven federal lower house seats and two positions on the Senate ticket were bought and sold that day. - Yes, Mr Speaker; the question was about donations to registered organisations and their influence on the democratic process. What we see here is something that I would say the vast majority of Australians would find appalling, disgusting and unacceptable, and that is that the preselections of members of this place are bought and sold in a sleazy, secret deal by members of the trade union movement. That is the reality. And who stood by and has done absolutely nothing? Who was so weak that he would not lift his finger in relation to this? None other than the Leader of the Opposition, so weak that he stands by and allows this undemocratic process to continue. Of course, the other party to this -  - One of the other officials of a registered organisation who has been involved in this, the fourth preselection aspirant, Mr David Feeney, who is described as an adept branch stacker in Victoria and established Transport 2020, a slush fund in Victoria -  - Mr Speaker, I am coming to the conclusion. This is another man who has been rewarded for his branch stacking by being made the assistant national secretary and director of the South Australian campaign. - In conclusion, I table a compendium of activities of this branch stacking which has been going on in the Victorian ALP, involving registered organisations, with many of the players here, including those who are challenging the member for Hotham, the member for Corio and the member for Maribyrnong. In addition to that, I produce for the interest of honourable members a flow chart which shows the interlocking relationships between these various players. This is sleazy, secret branch stacking - sleazy, secret buying and selling of places in the House of Representatives.</DOC>

 - Obviously, this happened six years ago, but I have had the opportunity during the last few weeks to examine all of this material again very carefully, which is why I know so much about it today, 28 February 2006. These are cables from early 2000, but I do know a lot about them and I have examined this material very carefully. I have done more than that: I have had to satisfy myself that my department responded appropriately to these allegations. I have done that myself. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition reads out the parts of the cable that suit him, but he does not read out the part of that cable where the UN Office of the Iraq Program noted it had no way of judging the accuracy or otherwise of the claims made. More than that, of course, we knew as time went on that these claims had been made by competitors of the Australian Wheat Board.What the department subsequently did, which is clear from not only these cables but subsequent material which has not yet been tabled in the Cole inquiry but if the Leader of the Opposition would care to listen he may be interested to know something about, was not just ring AWB Ltd, ask them a few questions and give up on that. It went back to the UN. The UN asked for very specific information. That information is referred to in one of these cables - the Austrade cable from March. It asked for very specific material and, I think quite rightly, the department followed up those claims to obtain that specific material.As I have said already in answer to questions, AWB Ltd were somewhat reluctant, if I may say so, to provide that material, but they did provide it. That material was then given to the UN investigators. They employed the experts to look at these contracts and they gave AWB Ltd a clean bill of health. So you have to look at the totality of the documentation and the totality of the story. The point is that I have done that. I have had a look at what has been done. I personally have been satisfied; I think the Minister for Trade, who obviously is involved as well, has been satisfied.What is more, just in case there is any doubt, the Labor Party will make their party political points, but this is all material which has gone to the Cole inquiry - all of it. Mr Cole can make his own decisions and his own assessments. He is probably not driven by the desperation of party politics like the Leader of the Opposition. I suspect Mr Cole may be driven by his record as an objective and excellent judge who is now retired but is a man of great distinction. He will make the decisions about whom he wants to talk to, when to talk to them and how to handle the inquiry. I can only say: thank God the Leader of the Opposition is not trying to conduct an inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and acknowledge his ongoing work in ensuring that the resources sector is promoted in Australia for the work that it does. 2006-07 will be another record year for exports in the resources sector, with ABARE today releasing figures which show that exports will reach an unprecedented $101 billion for minerals and energy. Iron ore exports will rise some 26 per cent to $18 billion and be almost double that which they were in 2004-05. LNG exports are expected to rise 22 per cent to $6 billion, again virtually doubling since 2004-05. Uranium exports are predicted to grow some eight per cent to be worth around $800 million.All this is very encouraging and this government continues to strive for improvement. The surge in global demand for uranium presents a real opportunity for Australia to build on its export performance. We have some 41 per cent of the world's uranium here in Australia and, with prices at a 20-year high and rising, there is an opportunity begging for Australia to do more and see these opportunities fulfilled, provided, of course, the rigorous environment, Indigenous, safety and non-proliferation safeguards are adhered to.The member for Kalgoorlie and, I am sure, the member for Solomon would also reflect on this when they ask about threats to the uranium industry. I need look no further than the policy shambles of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition says that there is a three-mines uranium policy which still stands even though there are four uranium mines in Australia. The Deputy Premier of South Australia says the policy is 'idiotic' and should be scrapped, and I would agree with that. The member for Batman, of course, says the policy does not even exist. It is a joke, quite frankly, and it is costing Australia. Even as recently as last weekend we saw Eley Griffiths portfolio manager Brian Eley state that the Australian uranium industry is at the mercy of the Labor Party. He said:It's not like nuclear power is new - and the Leader of the Opposition should listen to this - 18 per cent of the world's electricity is nuclear, but mining law is state based and it's very much a Labor Party debate.The opposition leader should also note that his colleagues in Western Australia are now agitating for a debate. I urge him to get on with it and produce a coherent uranium-mining policy for the good of jobs, investment and exports in Australia.</DOC>

 - When was it, Alexander? I will find out exactly when. I will take this question and go through it. When the Cole inquiry was established it sent a group of people to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My understanding is that they were invited to look at everything. It was made an open book and large numbers of documents were made available. I understand that two very large cartons full of documents were copied and taken away by the Cole investigation. Whether the four cables were in it or not, I cannot tell you. I can find out and give the Leader of the Opposition the exact date, but the reality is that at every point this government has cooperated with the Cole inquiry. We established the Cole inquiry. When there were concerns expressed by the Volcker inquiry at the beginning of last year about AWB and its lack of cooperation, as I have indicated publicly before, I gave very clear instructions to the bureaucracy. I asked the Minister for Trade to write a letter in the strongest possible terms to AWB telling it to cooperate with the Volcker inquiry.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that in all circumstances the government have cooperated with the established Cole inquiry. We have provided information to Cole and we have responded to requests for information from Cole. If in fact Cole wants anybody in the government to appear before the inquiry, those people so requested will appear before the inquiry. We are now into the fourth week of questions being asked entirely about this issue, and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith have not provided one iota of evidence. After all of this effort, they have forsaken time for questions on Medicare, industrial relations and tax. They have decided to ask question after question on this issue. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I am like the Minister for Foreign Affairs; I like getting questions on this issue. He was jumping out of his skin today to get some questions on this issue because we as a government do not have anything to hide - so much so that we are happy to take these questions. We established the Cole inquiry, and it will go on and reach its own conclusions and then the Australian public will have the benefit of analysing those conclusions.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: produce the evidence of the government deceit. It is worth reminding him that the original charge was that we were covering something up. They have moved away from that charge and have started to make allegations of deceit. They started to defame, under parliamentary privilege, the reputation of hardworking public servants. The Leader of the Opposition attacked the integrity of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party, but not in an open question because he is not game to do it. He does not get up in question time and say that he is really to blame. He says it across the table. That is a measure of two things: the lack of evidence to support the opposition's claim and a lack of straightforwardness on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. This government has been totally transparent on this issue, and this government is very happy to go on taking questions for as long as you like.</DOC>

 - There have been a number of issues raised around a number of cables at that time and obviously referring to allegations that had been made, as has been clearly pointed out in this place, by competitors of Australian wheat growers.

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Of course, we know that the wheat growers in his area and in fact wheat growers right across Australia are very interested in the ongoing relationship that we and they have with the markets across the world. Given recent events, it was decided that I should lead a delegation to Iraq over last weekend to meet with senior ministers in the Iraqi government in terms of the ongoing ability of Australian wheat growers to have access to that market. I can report that that delegation and that visit have been extremely successful in getting a clear indication - announced as part of a joint ministerial statement between myself and Dr Ahmad Chalabi, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister - that the Iraqi government is going to continue to welcome tenders from Australian wheat growers and Australian exporters to get wheat into that market in Iraq.Whilst I was there I had meetings with Prime Minister Al-Jaafari, Deputy Prime Minister Chalabi and trade minister Basit Karim - three senior ministers in the Iraqi government. At the time, the Iraqi government was dealing with a very sensitive and difficult domestic circumstance after the bombing the week before of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, but they saw the importance of the relationship between Australia and Iraq as having such standing that they saw me in the middle of all that was going on there. I received a guarantee from the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister - the man directly responsible for wheat trade - that Australia can continue to tender for Iraqi wheat contracts. - The Leader of the Opposition said, 'They said that the week before.' We know how the Labor Party operate: they send messages to each other through the media. The member for Batman, who is not here, sends messages to the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Griffith is always doing it, sending messages to the Leader of the Opposition. We are not prepared to accept that -  - No, I haven't. - So the object of the exercise -  - The point that I was making was that there might have been media reports but it was important that an Australian government minister participated in a direct personal meeting with an Iraqi government minister to confirm the relationship and the arrangements that would continue to exist in trade between our two countries - where you could stand face to face, eyeball to eyeball, and shake hands on an arrangement that was being put in place. -  - The Labor Party can carry on like a bunch of schoolgirls all they like, but the reality is, if they were running this country, they would have done exactly the same thing. They would have got on a plane and gone over - and, if they did not, they would be abrogating their responsibility to Australian grain growers. They would be abrogating their responsibility.As members would have clearly recognised when they read the joint ministerial statement that I issued with Dr Chalabi, there is a clear commitment to Australian grain and Australian exporters being welcome in that market. I might say, while I am on the subject, that in the discussions Dr Chalabi was very complimentary of the quick action the Australian government has taken to establish the Cole inquiry. He was very complimentary of the way we have done that and recognised that there had not been any other government that had taken the action that the Australian government had taken. Regardless of what the Labor Party have to say on this matter, Australian wheat growers should be comfortable in the knowledge that they will have continuing access to this market in Iraq. They will be welcome to continue to compete for tenders in the Iraq market.</DOC>

 - The substance of this issue was that AWB sought advice on payment of port fees, which was appropriately referred to the sanctions committee -  - The Leader of the Opposition is so fixated about times and dates. As I was beginning to say, the AWB sought advice on port fees. Advice was given. After seeking that advice from the UN sanctions committee, the issue was resolved to DFAT's knowledge and the AWB advised that the Iraqi demands were dropped. That is the essence of the issue. If you want me to check my records, I will check my records.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question, asked inter alia on behalf of the working men and women of that electorate. Mr Speaker, before I answer it, may I be permitted to join you in welcoming many former members of this House and another place to the gallery. I hope I can be forgiven for particularly singling out my old friend Sir James Killen. There was a time - a short time and a rather frantic time - in Australian politics when there was no more important Liberal in Australia than Sir James Killen. I welcome all of my former colleagues to this place.The good news, the really wonderful news, is that in the last 10 years real wages in this country have risen by 16.8 per cent. The member for Bass asks me how that compares with the record of the former government. I will tell you how it compares. - It is a word that Sir James Killen would be familiar with: it compares 'magnificently' with the performance of the former government. Over 13 years of Labor government, the real wages of Australian workers increased by a miserable 0.3 per cent - 13 years of Labor equals 0.3 per cent; 10 years of the coalition equals 16.8 per cent. I can only say again, as I have said before in this place, that, when we last faced the Australian people - and I had the opportunity of addressing a rally in Western Sydney - I had no prouder boast than to say to them that, under this government, more had been done for the working men and women of this country than any Labor government had ever dreamt of. It used to be the party of the workers. It used to be the party that looked after the interests of working men and women, but when it was last in office it boasted about the fact that it had suppressed real wages. By contrast, this government has presided over higher real wages, higher levels of employment, sharply lower interest rates, lower levels of taxation and higher numbers of apprentices. - Since 1996, real net household wealth has risen by an average of 8.8 per cent a year. Australia's unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent in March 1996 to 5.3 per cent now. In Australia, 1.7 million new jobs have been created under the coalition and inflation has been contained, averaging just 2½ per cent a year. The greatest obligation that any government has is to look to the interests of the average working men and women of this country. We have done it. It has been at the centre of everything that we have done as a government over the last 10 years, and these figures released today show that real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. Let me say that again: 16.8 per cent versus a miserable 0.3 per cent in 13 years of Labor. It is the latest piece of field evidence that this government remains dedicated to the interests of the average working men and women of this country.</DOC>

 - I have answered this. He is asking me when I read a cable in 2001. I said to him I will check when I saw the cable, but the substance of the cable was about port fees. It was addressed by the UN sanctions committee. The trade went on and the cargo was unloaded without there being -  -  - That is what we have been told. If it is a major debating point - when you read it or when you did not read it - the resultant action justifies the position the government has continued to take in this whole matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him that the national accounts came out for the December quarter today. They showed solid economic growth of 0.5 per cent for the quarter and 2.7 per cent for the year. Importantly, we see that consumption is continuing to moderate and the housing cycle, which the government expressed concern about some years ago, continues to readjust. National growth is now led by business investment. New private engineering construction grew 7.1 per cent in the quarter and 29.8 per cent through the year. New machinery and equipment investment grew 6.2 per cent in the quarter and 15.8 per cent through the year.What we are seeing now is a rebalancing of the Australian economy - out of the housing cycle and consumption into business investment - which will build capacity and, particularly in the mining industry, allow Australia to take advantage of very strong terms of trade. That terms of trade increase indicates the importance of experienced management, and not just experienced management on this side of the House but, if the opposition should ever come to government, they would need experienced management too. But unfortunately the factional war lords -  - are about to shoot all the experience of the Victorian ALP. We had the member for Maribyrnong yesterday terminated with extreme prejudice. - It is important to have experienced management, and it is necessary to have experience on both sides of the parliament. That will not be helped by the member for Maribyrnong, who yesterday was terminated with extreme prejudice by a union official. - I think that the parliament would also benefit from the continuing experience of the member for Corio. The ghost who walks is not here because the factional war lords -  - Again I notice that the member for Hotham is another ghost who walks today. He is not here. But I was rather taken -  -  - It is important to have experience on both sides of the parliament because it is necessary for economic management. I got some support for this view with an article published in the Australian today called 'Storytellers galore but no story to tell'. It was written by the member for Batman, one of the more experienced members of parliament. - I want to cite, in support of my argument about the importance of experience in the parliament, an article in today's Australian written by the member for Batman entitled 'Storytellers galore but no story to tell'. The member for Batman said:_ after a decade in Opposition we have plenty of storytellers but not much of a story to tell. - I do not think it is necessary to try to gag what the member for Batman wrote. It is in a newspaper today. He talks about the need for experience amongst members. He says:This will not be remedied by rubbing out sitting MPs in safe Labor seats in favour of party hacks with factional numbers -  The member for Swan then left the chamber. 
 - The problem of experience amongst members of the opposition, as the member for Batman says:... will not be remedied by rubbing out sitting MPs in safe Labor seats in favour of party hacks with factional numbers on public office selection panels or through branch stacks.We would endorse that statement. I think both sides of parliament will join with the member for Batman and support colleagues on Labor's front bench with the experience that they bring to this parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member would be well aware of the addressees of the cable and that the cable contained information with regard to the general allegations about the AWB and contracts with Iraq. The cable also indicated: 'The deputy managing director may see fit to advise the Minister for Trade.' - I have checked my records following the tabling of this cable in the Cole inquiry, and I have checked with the then deputy managing director of Austrade. I do not have a record of any specific briefing he gave me; he does not have any record of any specific briefing he gave me. But the general issue that was being addressed and reported here was certainly known to the government at the time because DFAT were dealing with it. DFAT had taken advice. Information had come in from the mission in New York. They had sought responses from the AWB. This is all public knowledge in the public domain at the moment. DFAT were dealing with the issue in the broader public domain. They had sought advice from the AWB and ultimately they provided the information required to the UN, to the satisfaction of the UN.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is nice to have him ask a question when his predecessor in Tangney is sitting in the gallery - the Hon. Daryl Williams, a great Attorney-General. Saddam Hussein's trial commenced last October in Baghdad and he and seven of his henchmen are being tried in an Iraqi court. Of course, they are being tried by Iraqis. This is a case of the massacre of 148 people from the village of Dujail following an incident, as it is called, in 1982.The House will be interested to know that the court sat yesterday. It has previously heard witness testimony. Yesterday it had presented to it several documents, including a presidential order signed by Saddam Hussein in 1984 approving the death sentences of all 148 people and a document signed by his half-brother ordering the execution to take place. Investigators claim that 96 of them were executed and the remainder were liquidated during interrogation. The 148 allegedly included 10 aged between 11 and 17, who were executed later in secret.This is just one of the many appalling alleged crimes committed by Saddam Hussein's regime and it is a reminder - not that we need one on this side of the House - of the justice in bringing this cruel regime to an end. On this side of the House, when we think of all the things we have done over the last 10 years, it is one of the things that we are very proud of: that our country made a contribution to getting rid of that regime. In that context, I agreed with the Leader of the Opposition when he said yesterday that Saddam Hussein certainly had a weapons of mass destruction research program. During the course of last month the Leader of the Opposition said he may have actually been building weapons of mass destruction. The Leader of the Opposition also said yesterday: 'We know for a fact that Saddam was supporting terrorists,' and of course he has been talking at great length about Saddam rorting sanctions. This was, of course, a deeply corrupt regime. I would only say this -  The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. 
 - I make two observations. At a time when people like Sir James Killen were members of the House of Representatives, the Labor Party tried to raise $500,000 for the 1975 election campaign from Saddam Hussein's regime - Blues Point Tower. A curious position for a political party, but perhaps a cynic may say it was no coincidence that, come 2003, the Labor Party did not want to see that hideous regime overthrown.</DOC>

 - The member for Griffith knows full well the difference in this issue. It is about allegations of kickbacks and it is about allegations of the use of Alia. This is about questions with regard to the contracts. The substantive issue here is that these questions were answered to the satisfaction of the United Nations, which was running the oil for food program. The opposition know that, and they are just trying to create a political scandal out of this. This government has been totally transparent in offering up all the information to the Cole inquiry, as was clearly indicated to me by ministers in the Iraqi government. How complimentary they were of the fact that the Australian government has established this inquiry to get to the bottom of this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. This government does understand that the best possible health care cannot always come entirely free. No-one likes to see costs to patients rise but just occasionally it is necessary in order to ensure the sustainability of the system. This is why the government very reluctantly increased the PBS copayment so that the patient PBS contribution should be restored to roughly the level applying under the former Labor government. It is very important that ministers should give credit where it is due. I am very pleased to acknowledge that the member for Hotham strongly supported the government's copayment decision. It was a difficult issue but he strongly supported it and now we have the faceless men of the Victorian Labor Party trying to eliminate the member for Hotham because, on this precise point of the PBS copayment, the member for Hotham fingered the rats in Labor's ranks. I am quoting from The Latham Diaries on page 301:A disgraceful Caucus meeting this morning.Very truthful diaries according to the member for Lalor. - The member for Lalor is somewhat self-absorbed, but I am not going to refer to the member for Lalor. I am quoting about the PBS:A disgraceful Caucus meeting this morning. The geniuses were getting ready to roll - McMullan -  on his PBS recommendation ..._            _            _Someone leaked news of the stoush to Channel Ten ...Crean blames Smith, says he saw him scurrying out of the Caucus room to the phone. - I am quoting from The Latham Diaries:He - Crean - also reckons all the speakers against the PBS recommendation were Beazley supporters.What we have is payback time for the member for Hotham's principled stand on the PBS copayment. Saturday's Weekend Australian said:As Mr Crean and his Khmer language translator continue to visit the large number of Cambodian preselectors ...I table some PBS documents in Khmer because it might help the member for Hotham in his doorknocking. -  - I make this point -  -  - I have the call. A point of order had been taken on me. I make this point -  - I have tabled some PBS documents to assist the member for Hotham in his doorknocking. I make the point that this is what the modern Labor Party has come to - a former alternative prime minister of this country is reduced to pleading for his political life through a translator. This is what they have come to. I am all in favour of migrants joining political parties but not to be robots for factional war lords. -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about probity in government. What about a bit of probity in opposition? What about saying to those ethnic branch stackers, 'Yes, I'll give you a bit of good, old-fashioned Aussie freedom to vote for whoever you want in the Hotham preselection'?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. I appreciate the interest she shows in the Pacific region, which is so important to Australia and which she has visited from time to time. Of course, the government has a very strong interest in a stable and prosperous South Pacific and we accept, as the Prime Minister has often said, that we have special responsibilities in the region. - Pacific island countries are facing many challenges, so inevitably we are generous. Australia now provides nearly $1 billion a year in effective aid to the South Pacific, if you include Papua New Guinea. One of the keys to our policy is good governance, which in our view is a cornerstone of sustainable development. The quality of government underpins economic prosperity, quality of life and also security.Our aid program has included restoration of the rule of law and justice in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville; the introduction of the Enhanced Cooperation Program in Papua New Guinea, parts of which are working very well; regional leadership to tackle HIV-AIDS; and the establishment of the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program, which has been great for many of the Pacific island countries and wonderful for a lot of young Australians, as many members on both sides of the House will know.The honourable member asked if there were any alternatives. There are. The member for Maribyrnong, as the shadow minister for overseas aid and Pacific island affairs, has worked tirelessly on this issue. I remember warmly the time he travelled with me in December 2004 to the Pacific islands. - He showed interest, enthusiasm and decency. I was very impressed with him and got on very well with him, if I may say so, to interject a personal element here. He produced very recently a policy which, let us face it, had a few less than flattering things to say about the government, but I suppose that is the work of an opposition. But he put a lot of work into it, and whether you agree with all of it or not you have to admire a man who went to that much trouble. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday of the member for Maribyrnong that he was an outstanding shadow minister who had developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the affairs of the region. I think that is right, which makes me wonder why the Leader of the Opposition did not support him - The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - As I was saying, such a good and successful shadow minister, a member of this House with such experience, deserves the support of his leader. And he did not get it, despite the fact that his leader thought he was outstanding. Either he said he was outstanding but did not mean it, which is why he did not support him, or he did not think he was outstanding at all but thought he may as well say it. It is either one or the other. Those are certainly not the words of a strong man and a true leader.So, as his colleagues are taken away one by one to political execution, the Leader of the Opposition washes his hands like Pontius Pilate and just allows them to be taken away. 'It's nothing to do with me, Officer,' I suppose is his message. - Let me in conclusion go back to what I was saying about alternative policies. The Leader of the Opposition is prepared to dismiss the member for Maribyrnong - he was not prepared to support him - yet the member for Maribyrnong put more effort into policy in his short period as shadow minister than the Leader of the Opposition has put into policy in his endless years as Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question. We have considered that. I do not think it is a desirable alternative to current arrangements to inject the government into the equation. I do not think I can say more than that. The situation is that pending the outcome of the Cole inquiry - which obviously will bear on the future of AWB Ltd and not automatically in any way on the future of the single desk policy - the single desk policy must be looked at separately from the future of AWB. There are very strong arguments in favour of maintaining the single desk, and I have no hesitation in repeating that it remains government policy to maintain the single desk. If we were to consider a change in the future, it would be lunacy from the point of view of this country's national interest for us to give away the single desk unilaterally. It would only ever be something you would contemplate giving away in the context of international trade negotiations. But we have looked at the very point that was raised by the member for New England. Our strong preference - and it will be no surprise to him - being a government that prefers the free enterprise option to a government option, is not to go down that path, and we do not intend to go down that path. But I thank the honourable member for the question. It gives me an opportunity to restate the government's position.Also, as the member for New England invited me to comment on the Deputy Prime Minister's comments, can I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister on the success of his mission to Iraq. He did good things in a difficult environment for the future of the Australian wheat industry. The wheat growers of Australia know that, and the wheat growers of Australia will continue to respect him for it.</DOC>

 - I have heard reports - indeed, an avalanche of criticism - about the activities of registered organisations, namely, certain trade unions and their officials who have been involved in the serial stacking of branches of the Labor Party in Victoria. This was confirmed yesterday by the member for Maribyrnong, who said that his demise as the member for Maribyrnong at the end of this parliament is the result of sleazy deals done by members of registered organisations. - There is no doubt about it: there are deep divisions in the Australian Labor Party about this issue. When these sleazy deals are mentioned, one person's name usually comes to the fore - Mr David Feeney. Mr Feeney, along with Mr Richard Marles, one of the union officials challenging the member for Corio for his preselection, was involved in setting up Transport 2020, a slush fund.The opportunity to raise a point of order should not be misused to deliberately disrupt proceedings or to respond to debate. If this is, or is anticipated to be, the case, or if the Speaker believes that he or she is aware of the issues, Speakers have cut short the point of order ... Members have been disciplined by the Chair for raising spurious or frivolous points of order and for persisting with matters after the Chair has ruled.Mr Speaker, to assist you I bring that to your attention. - Transport 2020 is a slush fund - set up by Mr Feeney and Mr Marles, the candidate standing against the member for Corio - whose purpose it is to fund union and ALP memberships for its associates. We know from reports that this fund has been used extensively in the seat of Corio. Mr Feeney was also sacked from the staff of the then opposition leader in Victoria, John Brumby, for his engagement in branch stacking. He was sacked as the ALP state secretary in Victoria in 2002 by Greg Sword, again for his branch-stacking activities. That of course does not stop you being rewarded in the Labor Party. He is now the assistant national secretary and the campaign manager in the South Australian state elections. If there were any leadership from the Leader of the Opposition - and the Labor Party - in this regard, he would demand the resignation of Mr Feeney from these positions. -  -  - That's quite a knockout punch -  - Mr Speaker -  -  - Mr Speaker, the reality here is either you condone these sleazy secret deals or you oppose them. Last night we had a prominent Labor senator from Victoria running around the gallery complaining that the flow chart which I tabled yesterday could not have been accurate because he did not figure prominently enough in the flow chart! - </DOC>

 - I clearly say two things. First of all, it is perfectly clear, even from the shadow minister's question, that I did not mislead the House. More than that, you see, the point I keep making, both yesterday and in the media this morning -  - is the fact is that at the end of this investigation the United Nations concluded that AWB Ltd had not been doing what had been alleged by the Canadian Wheat Board. But all of this is being considered by the Cole commission and, regardless of what the opposition may say or claim - and they have spent three weeks of parliamentary time talking of nothing else, no doubt to the complete distraction and boredom of the Australian public - the simple fact is that the Cole commission is looking through all of these issues. We have given all appropriate information that the Cole commission has wanted to the Cole commission and we look forward to them completing their hearings and to Commissioner Cole producing his report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He served for 22 years in the Australian Army, including being an Army test pilot, and his values and his hard work were welcomed warmly into the Liberal family only two years ago.On 1 March 1901, the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy were formed. Today recognises and celebrates the 105th anniversary of these two great services. Throughout that period of time, over more than a century, those values of hard work, idealism, self-sacrifice, comradeship and courage have played a very important role in moulding Australia's identity. Most importantly, today they are reflected in the service of almost 2,000 Australian service men and women who not only are protecting and securing Australia's borders from illegal immigrants and illegal fishing but also are in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and the Middle East.It is extremely important to us as a government to say on behalf of Australians how enormously proud we are of our service men and women, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are determined to continue to support them. We will not under any circumstances cut and run until the task before them is complete. I join you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister in recognising Sir James Killen, who himself was a former distinguished Minister for Defence. Remember that date of the establishment of our Army and our Navy: 1 March 1901. For any Australian and any parent who has a son or a daughter who wants to make a real difference not only in our country but throughout the world, the number to call is 13 1901. If anyone on the other side is looking for employment, you are never too old.</DOC>

 - This was the answer I gave to the member for Griffith. He asked me this question and this is the answer I gave. I ask every member of the House to listen very carefully. The question was: did he have access to any other Australian government money to support his activities in Iraq? Answer: yes. - Yes. Mr Flugge and other members of the Australian agricultural team had oversight of funds for reconstruction of the Iraqi ministry for agriculture and Iraqi Grains Board building and the purchase of communications equipment. All these funds have been duly acquitted. In other words, this is a slur against my colleague the Leader of the National Party. -  - What? He got hold of this money for the National Party? He did not use it for the National Party; it was used for the benefit of the people of Iraq. The member for Griffith is so bereft of relevant questions that he has now resorted to dishonest slurs on the integrity of the Leader of the National Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and for his continued strong representation on behalf of his electorate. On this vital issue of water reform, the Commonwealth government has provided the policy leadership and the economic incentive through the National Water Initiative to encourage the states to fully participate and to put their own houses in order. I was intrigued, distressed and dismayed when visiting Queensland recently to hear that Premier Beattie is planning to charge farmers $100 a bore, for each and every bore on their property, claiming that it is a National Water Initiative.For many of us the Labor Party's asking for $100 a bore sounds like selling tickets to a Labor Party fundraiser, but for Queensland farmers it is a great deal more serious. But Premier Beattie has gone even further: he is proposing a windmill tax - a windmill management charge. This is not justified or explainable in any shape or form under the National Water Initiative.Thankfully for Australia's farmers, not all members of the Labor Party are so out of touch or so arrogant and dismissive of primary producers. I refer of course to the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Corio, who is not here today. He is facing a preselection in his electorate on the weekend, and he may not be sitting here for much longer. Yet, as a former dairy farmer, the member for Corio, I venture to suggest, is the last of the Labor Party members to have any link with primary production. How many other dairy farmers are there on that side of the House or primary producers -  The member for Gorton then left the chamber. 
 - The member for Corio is a champion for agricultural issues. He is not always entirely effective but you would not know that from listening to the Leader of the Opposition. He has been asked countless times to indicate some degree of support for the position of the member for Corio. He has never given a straight answer. He will never mention him by name. In case the Leader of the Opposition was not listening to AM this morning, I will remind him of the comments of the member for Corio, who said:Well I think the leader would appreciate more than anybody else that if you don't give loyalty you don't get it. And at the end of the day, it might not be me; it might be the leader.Those words were from the member for Corio, in conjunction with the member for Batman, the member for Hotham and no doubt the member for Maribyrnong. -  - The member for Lingiari, who has a great interest in water reform and has spoken often on the subject, said with regard to the preselection war that it was the work of 'standover merchants, thugs and other sleazebags'. So there you have it: the Leader of the Opposition has done nothing for agriculture. In the absence of the member for Corio the Labor Party will do nothing for agriculture.</DOC>

 - I have a clear recollection -  - Do you want to hear the answer or not? You are a squawking lot over there. I have a very clear recollection of the meetings I had in Iraq in 2003. In fact on my recent visit to Iraq over the weekend we reflected on some of those activities with both the members of the Australian Defence Force and the members of the Iraqi government, as it was my second visit to Iraq post 2003. While I am answering this question I will take the opportunity of acknowledging and thanking very much the Australian defence forces in Iraq for their efforts today and then. They looked after and accommodated our visit to Iraq to ensure that we look after the Australian national interest in Iraq today, as we did then. I did have a meeting with Trevor Flugge in Iraq. The insinuations being drawn by the Australian Labor Party are absolutely outrageous. - The comments of the Leader of the Labor Party while I was in Iraq are just as outrageous, and are an insult to the people of Australia. He will live to eat his words. But in answer to his question: yes, I do remember that meeting with Mr Flugge. - I do remember meeting Mr Flugge at the Ministry of Agriculture in Baghdad at the time, along with the representative from the Interim Governing Council who was looking after agriculture. Because of the efforts of the Australian government, I think that was the first ministry that was up and functioning under the CPA after the war in Iraq. In fact it was noted by the CPA head, Paul Bremer, who said that the Ministry of Agriculture was 'the first Iraqi ministry building to be functioning and the first to be handed over to the new Iraqi administration'. Australia and its agriculture team in Iraq were congratulated by CPA head, Paul Bremer, on the reconstruction and re-establishment of this critical ministry.We are proud of what we did as a government and as a nation to help re-establish this country. I conveyed that again to Prime Minister Jaafari and Minister Chalabi in terms of the support we are continuing to give in this fledgling democracy to ensure that it survives.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He might like to listen to the answer. There was a series of questions on cables yesterday and, as he knows, there are probably over 100,000 cables in the system each year. Cables are sometimes brought to the attention of ministers by staff; sometimes ministers are just briefed by staff. Yes, I said I would check my records, and we have no record that it was actually brought to my attention - that it was printed off and presented to me. I have no recollection of personally reading the cable, but certainly I would expect that staff at the time would have brought the general contents of that cable to my attention.With respect to the subsequent issue, in the assertion being made by the Leader of the Opposition he referred to comments I made, I think on 8 November last year. I refer him to comments I subsequently made on 9 November by way of clarification. Even then the Labor Party were trying to muddy the waters on this issue. I refer him to the answer I gave on the 9th.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He represents an electorate in Australia that is a powerhouse of export at the moment. According to ABARE, forecasts for this year indicate that that is going to dramatically rise in the resources sector. But there is no doubt at all, in response to the member for Kalgoorlie, that Australia is a much better place economically today than it was 10 years ago - there is no question about that. During that period of time our government put the budget back in the black. From where it was for years and years, running deficit budgets, we eliminated government debt during that period.We inherited a government debt level of about $96 billion as a legacy of Labor. We have restored Australia's AAA credit rating. We have delivered more than 1.7 million jobs throughout the Australian economy and maintained an environment that has kept interest rates low. We have provided substantial tax cuts as the economy and the country could afford it. There are higher wages today, and the wages growth that has taken place during those 10 years has been based on productivity gains, not arbitrated outcomes, and there have been higher gains of real wages than in the 13 years of Labor. -  - This has all delivered better living standards to all Australians. There has been more funding for health and education, defence and transport. The economic resilience of Australia has become the envy of the developed world. We all know what the alternative policies are. Every single measure we have introduced to improve the Australian economy over those years has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party every inch of the way.I was asked about exports, and there are some interesting statistics. A few members of the Labor Party often have some comments - very unfounded and unsubstantiated comments - to make about exports. Exports in 1995 were worth $93.9 billion; in 2005, $176.7 billion. They went from $93 billion to $176 billion. Our resources exports, for the information of the member for Kalgoorlie - as I know he is terribly interested in this - are predicted to grow by a massive 36 per cent in 2005-06, off a high base, not a low base.I was asked about alternative views, and I was interested to hear of a news report on 4BC radio in Brisbane recently. The member for Lilley was featured in that interview. The newsreader reported - and these are his words - the member for Lilley's alternative views: 'There are claims the Howard government's failure to increase Australian exports is detracting from economic growth.' I do not know what going from $93 billion to $176 billion is, but it is certainly not a decrease. The member for Lilley went on to say: 'In fact, our trade performance is flawed.'We all know the track record of the member for Lilley. He has claimed from time to time that night is day and black is white, that a $600 family payment is not real money. He has claimed that an $80 billion increase in exports, from $93 billion to $176 billion, is a flawed policy and is not real. The Australian Labor Party, from the start of their 10 years in opposition, have opposed every single measure we have put in place to improve and strengthen the Australian economy - and they still do - and then they run around with weasel words to try and devalue the great achievements of Australian exporters.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question. I was going to make a personal explanation about this in any case at the end of question time, in response to an article along the lines of that question in the Australian Financial Review today, written by Mr John Kerin. I was asked a series of questions - which I am sure honourable members opposite would like to hear about - in one question by the member for Griffith on 31 October, and I gave a very comprehensive, although somewhat interrupted, answer. In response to that question, I said exactly this:As far as the government is aware, the first knowledge of Alia and concerns relating to the AWB's use of the company was in the context of the Volcker inquiry.That is exactly right. The issue of the cables to which the honourable member refers, by the way, had been the subject of discussion and debate in the House on 3 November 2005 and in the Senate estimates committee on the same day. The opposition subsequently, this week, came into the House waving around these cables, trying to convince people up in the press gallery that there is something new here which had not been discussed right here on the floor of this chamber on 3 November.What this episode shows is exactly what I have argued in question time over the last year - that is, the Leader of the Opposition does not do his homework, is not forensic, has not followed the issue and makes a series of empty, blustering allegations which are not based on the facts. The fact is: what I said on 31 October, I absolutely stand by.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Australia has a very sound system of corporate governance and corporate regulation. Under the Australian Constitution, the Commonwealth has a corporations power, but it is a limited power. As a result of High Court decisions, the Commonwealth has had corporations legislation struck down in the past. In order to rectify that, it has been necessary for the Commonwealth to have a referral from the states so that it has full constitutional power over Corporations Law. That referral, which has been made in the wake of constitutional challenges, was for a limited period and is due to expire on 15 July this year.The Ministerial Council for Corporations and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General recommended in July 2004 that the referral be extended for another five years to 2011. The Ministerial Council for Corporations endorsed that decision in November 2004. South Australia and Tasmania have taken the necessary steps to extend that referral. Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have not yet done anything. I make it clear that, if this referral is not given to the Commonwealth before July 2006, Australia's system of Corporations Law will, in significant respects, be unconstitutional and there will be no certainty in the administration of companies in this country.I hope the reason why the referrals have not been given is that the states have not yet got around to it and that they intend to do so before July 2006. I was concerned, however, that the Premier of the member for Lilley's own state has suggested that the states may not be giving that referral of the Corporations Law because they believe that, by refusing to give that referral, they will undermine the government's industrial relations legislation.It is known that the states want to take a constitutional challenge to the industrial relations legislation. It is known that that legislation is based on the corporations power. But if the states decide, as a technique in trying to undermine that industrial relations legislation, that they will not extend the referral to the Commonwealth, the whole system of Corporations Law in Australia will be under threat. As a consequence - and I cannot put this any more strongly - Australia's economic position will be under threat. This is not a plaything. The Corporations Law governs every company in Australia. If that law is at risk of being declared unconstitutional, then the effect on the Australian economy would be very severe.There are now, unfortunately, only three months to go before those referrals can be effected. I call on each and every one of the states to immediately take the steps that are necessary. We cannot afford to have the Corporations Law at risk for one day in relation to its importance here in Australia and the economic effects such uncertainty would have.</DOC>

 - They are not very smart on the Labor side. You continue to prove it. In answer to the last question I referred the Leader of the Opposition to my answer to a question on 9 November after he referred to a question on 8 November last year. He asked about a cable in April 2001. This is about an issue of port fees. That is the substance of the issue, if you go back to the cable. He is aware of the first cable. He is very well aware of the inquiry that was made by AWB and the advice given by the UN. That was given back to them. It is very easy to ask these questions in hindsight. The answer I gave to the question at the end of last year clearly identified and differentiated between concerns that were raised back then and allegations that were raised in the context of the Volcker inquiry - very different. I refer the Leader of the Opposition again to the answers that I gave him. - I did not mislead the parliament. I answered those questions very clearly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert. He comes from Townsville and we sometimes call Townsville 'the Geneva of the Pacific' because peace talks are being held there for the Solomon Islands and other places. It would not have happened if it had not been for the hard work of the current member for Herbert. It never happened when there was a Labor member.The government welcomes yesterday's announcement that Fiji will hold its elections between 6 and 13 May. When I was recently in Fiji I announced $3 million to assist with election planning and budgeting. Today I have announced a further $1 million to assist with voter registration, electoral officer training and support for the Fiji police and logistics.Prime Minister Qarase will invite Australia to send observers to the elections. I am sure there will be a lot of volunteers from within the House for that position. It is our view - and I am sure all members of the House share this view - that the elections should be free and fair. Fiji has worked hard to recover from the 2000 coup. Its prosperity, particularly as tourism is so important to Fiji, depends very substantially on political stability and economic growth. It is important, let me say - particularly in the context of some of the comments that Commodore Bainimarama has made in recent times - that the military stays out of politics and respects the authority of the democratically elected government and the rule of law.The honourable member asked if there were any other policies. If I may say so, the member for Maribyrnong, as the shadow minister for overseas aid and Pacific island affairs, knows a lot about these issues. The Leader of the Opposition described him as an excellent shadow minister. As I said yesterday, he has done a good job in that role and the Leader of the Opposition has been happy to see him wiped out by union heavies in his preselection. The Leader of the Opposition has form on Fijian affairs, because anybody who has bothered to read Bob Hawke's autobiography - it is an interesting read - will recall that Bob Hawke revealed that at the time of the 1987 coup in Fiji, which I think was the first of those coups, the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Defence and wanted to send the Australian military in to intervene in Fiji at that time. That is rather similar to his idea last year to send Australian helicopters into New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. - Mr Hawke said in his autobiography that he regarded these ideas of the Leader of the Opposition as an 'amusing excess'. The point, of course, is that the member for Maribyrnong knows a lot about Fiji but the Leader of the Opposition has not stood by him, so Labor's one source of expertise on Fijian affairs has now been lost.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition refers to quotes and makes allegations. I will check that quote that he has referred to and see whether I made that comment and in what context. The most important point to make here, and this is something that is lost on the Labor Party, is that our responsibility on behalf of Australian wheat growers - with the knowledge that the AWB had continually said to us that they were operating within the guidelines of the UN Sanctions Committee and that we continually reminded them of their responsibilities in that regard right through the whole process of the program - was, when there were from time to time concerns about contamination as there were last year, that we represented the interests of Australian wheat growers to keep their trade flowing. I will check the assertion that the Leader of the Opposition has made about a comment I made in 2002.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. I can inform him and the House that, thanks to the private health insurance rebate, nearly nine million Australians have affordable access to the private hospital system. That means they are far less likely to be competing for a place in very crowded public hospital queues. Fifty-six per cent of all surgery is now done in private hospitals. That is over one million procedures which would otherwise have to be done in the public system but for the government's support for private health insurance.I am afraid few members opposite appreciate the importance of the private health insurance rebate - but not the member for Hotham. The member for Hotham said when he was the leader of the Labor Party:... I am absolutely committed to keeping the private health rebate.It is payback time now. Today's Australian quotes one preselector as saying:Simon Crean's interpreter rang last night and said please, please. And then Hong Lim rang nearly at midnight ...... Hong Lim, he says that Labor has lost four times to the Liberal Party and it's why we need a new person -  - 'He says' -  - The preselector continues:_ Hong Lim, he says that Labor has lost four times to the Liberal Party and it's why we need a new person to come up to win the election.An answer must be relevant to the question. - So Mr Lim is supporting the member for Brand who is a two-time loser and attacking the member for Hotham who never had a chance to lose an election. - I can only assume that in all of this something has been lost in the translation. To assist Labor Party doorknockers I table a Khmer language description of the government's policies. - Just because the member for Grayndler thinks that the private health insurance rebate has been a resounding failure, that is no reason for the member for Grayndler to want to get the member for Hotham.

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and for his interest. I know his own constituents will be interested and pleased he asked the question. The United States Department of State has announced that the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, will be visiting Australia from 16 to 18 March. This will be the first time that Condoleezza Rice has visited Australia as Secretary of State. It will be an opportunity for her to meet with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and me. I think the Attorney-General and the Treasurer are going to have the opportunity to meet her as well. During her visit we will also have the first meeting at the ministerial level of the trilateral strategic dialogue between the American Secretary of State, Japanese Foreign Minister Aso, who is coming here, and the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs.This visit underscores the importance of the American alliance. We had the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, here in November of last year. We are entirely unapologetic about our close relationship with the United States. It is a country which we engage with very heavily over Asia-Pacific matters. The United States is deeply important, for example, in the fight against terrorism in South-East Asia. We very much appreciate the cooperation we have with them just on that task alone.As far as any alternative views are concerned, we know that there is a strong vein of anti-Americanism that runs through the opposition, and that was illustrated only too clearly by the candidate survey which found that only 40 per cent of Labor candidates thought the American alliance was of great importance to Australia. I wonder whether this has any implications for the current preselection debacle where my friend the member for Maribyrnong has been so poorly treated by the Leader of the Opposition.I notice in a Queensland newspaper that a man called Ivan Molloy is planning to stand for Labor preselection for Fairfax at the next election. Talking of gun-toting, Mr Molloy is a gun-toting anti-American who, if not having been a supporter of terrorists, could be described as an apologist for terrorists. He is deeply anti-American. I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition - so happy to allow his own colleagues who sit on the front bench with him to be dumped - approves of Ivan Molloy being preselected for the Labor Party. Mark Latham described him as the 'candidate from hell'. I would not think so. We on this side of the House had good fun with him during the last federal election campaign. The interesting thing about the Leader of the Opposition is a serious point: he is prepared to turn his back on and see dumped colleagues who are shadow ministers but he is quite happy for Ivan Molloy to run as a Labor Party candidate in Fairfax. What a weak man.</DOC>

 - The question not only attacks Mr Flugge, which the Labor Party enjoys so much, but assumes that because Mr Flugge and his team used cash in Iraq at that time -  
An opposition member - How much? - however much it may have been - there was somehow something inappropriate about that. Let me explain. Is there something inappropriate about using cash in a country straight after a war when there is no banking system? Indeed, he used cash. There was no other way of financing the rehabilitation of agriculture in Iraq because there was no banking system. I know the Labor Party is thick, but on this side of the House we believed in helping the Iraqi people, we believed in getting rid of Saddam Hussein, we believed in helping restore Iraqi agriculture, and we are not so thick that we did not know you had to pay for it; we knew that. If there is no banking system, how were we meant to pay for it? If Mr Flugge used $1 million, he would have used a substantial -  - I am not arguing with his numbers. The point I am making is that he used Australian funds. He had to use cash - not cheques, Visa cards or American Express cards - to make payments to contractors rehabilitating infrastructure. The disappointing thing for the Labor Party is that all of these payments were fully acquitted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I know that he, like me, is truly excited by the fact that Melbourne, one of the great sporting cities of the world -  -  - I say that coming from Sydney! I have always recognised that Sydney is the city of participants and Melbourne is the city of enthusiastic spectators of great sports. That is why it has those marvellous facilities. Seriously, 5,000 athletes from around 71 countries are expected to converge on Melbourne for the Commonwealth Games. In total, more than one million people from Australia and around the world will be involved. Up to 100,000 spectators are expected to take part in the colour and excitement of the opening ceremony. I am sure that it will be a wonderful sporting vocation.However, in the post-September 11 environment, it is important that the government take every step necessary to ensure that the games are not only successful but also as safe as possible. The security preparations for the games, I think, demonstrate at a practical level the way in which the Commonwealth and the government of Victoria have worked together to protect our community from terrorism. To ensure that these activities are properly supported, we will be providing $85 million worth of security for the games as part of a broader contribution of over $300 million.During the games, the Australian government as a whole will support Victoria in a number of different ways: through our intelligence agency and the Australian Federal Police; using the specialist capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, including a forward deployment to Melbourne for quick activation should a terrorist threat emerge; and maintaining a high level of security for transport infrastructure, including air, maritime and ground.The relationship between the Australian and Victorian governments on security matters is built on the sound history of cooperation that we have seen amongst Australian governments generally. I am sure the end result will be one of the best Commonwealth Games ever and a demonstration of the robust and effective security capability that we have been building in recent years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. Obviously, the whole debate about the oil for food program and wheat exports across the world, particularly to Iraq, has raised an element of expectation and concern for Australian wheat growers, who are genuinely trying to do their job of growing wheat and selling it for the best price overseas. We have continued to support them in that. As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday in his response to the member for New England's question, he is well aware of the government's policy on the existence and operation of the single desk.On the member for New England's point about the operation of the single desk and the involvement of wheat growers, the wheat growers of Australia, whether they be in the eastern states or the western states, feel very attached to the mechanism that has served them well over many years. We do not envisage in the short term any changes in this policy. As we have done in the past, in communicating, seeking responses and consulting with grower bodies in the different sectors of agriculture, of course we would consult with the wheat-growing community of Australia if there were any proposed changes to the mechanisms that are in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. There is no finer representative of the strong directions and mainstream values of this government than the member for Lindsay. She herself had a distinguished career in the Royal Australian Air Force.The first responsibility of the government is the defence of Australia and the protection of Australia and its interests. Ten years ago when this government came to office and found that we had been left with a $10.3 billion deficit - accumulated and given to us in part in no small way by the now Leader of the Opposition - the first and only area of government expenditure that was not subjected to bringing spending below income was that of Defence. At the same time what the Howard government did was to shift $800 million from the back end of Defence, from the desks, to the front end of Defence, from the tail to the teeth. In the year 2000 the Prime Minister released the white paper on defence which set the 10-year vision and strategic direction for defence in Australia and added another $28½ billion to defence expenditure out to the year 2010. Since then we have now approved 141 major capability projects which include -  - Those 141 major capability projects have included not only rectifying the significant problems given to us in the Collins class submarines by a previous Minister for Defence - which are now world class, I might add - but also investing in 22 attack armed reconnaissance helicopters. We have taken delivery in the United States in the last week of five of the first 59 heavy Abrams tanks, we have got 14 Armidale class patrol boats and the member for Leichhardt only last week told the people of Cairns that the $75 million upgrade there will proceed. The government recently announced, in addition to that, another $1½ billion to increase the size of and to give more strength and tanks to the Australian Army.I might also add that in all of this the government has made it a priority to see that wherever possible Australian industry can invest in and contribute to hard earned Australian taxpayers' investments in defence. In fact, I read in today's Australian Financial Review Mr Geoffrey Barker saying of the government in defence over the last 10 years and going forward:No peacetime government has attended to defence policy in all its dimensions more assiduously, or even more obsessively, than the Howard government.He said it has presided 'over major organisational reforms, significant developments in strategic and force structure policy and continuing growth in defence spending'. I think the Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association put it very well when he said:The National Security Committee of Cabinet is probably the most successful since World War II.This government will not be cutting and running in defence, whether it is in Iraq or Afghanistan or indeed in the long-term strategic direction in the defence of Australia and the investment required to support it, which includes in no small way a strong economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. The Howard government, in the last 10 years, has had as its highest priority Australian families - maintaining Australian families, supporting Australian families, encouraging and rewarding Australian families. In fact, over this time we have a proud record of having increased funding to Australian families through the family assistance payment from $16 billion to $27 billion. We have continued to provide taxation relief so that single-income families with a child can today earn some $45,000 and pay no net tax. That is a very positive thing for families. We have also increased the number of child-care places - in fact doubling them - and, of course, we have the child-care rebate of 30 per cent. And in the area of superannuation we have the co-contribution helping families and we are actually letting women contribute to their own superannuation whilst being at home.Most important are the fundamentals that we have got right. We are taking the pressure off families by keeping interest rates and inflation low, allowing people to own their own home and creating over 1.7 million jobs, all of which are helping Australian families. The member for Greenway, who represents so many middle-income Australian families in her seat out in the western parts of Sydney, knows only too well how easy it is to put under threat their lifestyle and security. To that end, as we currently stand, the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, does not support the 30 per cent health rebate, which is supporting these families, and he does not support the 30 per cent rebate for child care. At the last election the opposition's policy was to go forward not with 80,000 out of school hours care places, as the Howard government's policy was, but with less than 10 per cent of that total. Their policy was cobbled together at the last moment to try to respond to a government that cares for families.Of course, the member for Lilley said it all when he said that the family tax supplement of $600 per child, which the Howard government provides directly into the pockets of Australian families, was 'not real money'. Has he retracted that comment? No. Has he been condemned by the member for Brand? No. Everybody on this side of the House knows that it is most important that we look after the family members closest to us and that we look after the Australian family.My advice to the member for Brand is look after your Labor family. Do not deny the rights of the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Hotham, the members closest to you, because when you, as the Leader of the Opposition, run away from those who are supposed to be closest to you - the family members of the Labor Party - you also run away from the Australian public.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I have not in any way misrepresented what the commissioner has said. I have his statement before me. The commissioner has said that, under the current terms of reference, he has the power to make findings of fact in relation to the behaviour of a whole list of people and organisations, including the Commonwealth. He uses the expression 'the Commonwealth' generically. That means he can make findings of fact in relation to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, findings of fact in relation to ministers and findings of fact in relation to employees or officers of statutory authorities.I invite the Leader of the Opposition to contemplate for a moment the difference between a finding of fact and a finding that there has been a breach of law by somebody. There is a very clear distinction. Any rudimentary understanding of how our legal system operates would tell you that there is a difference between making a finding of fact and going on to then say that the finding of fact represents a breach of the law. The commissioner could find, for example, that X had done something in a careless fashion, but that does not represent a breach of the law. It does not represent a criminal offence.The commissioner goes on to say - and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this:Accordingly, if, during the course of my inquiry, it appears to me that there might have been a breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law by the Commonwealth - again, generically used - or any officer of the Commonwealth related to the subject matter of the terms of reference, I will approach the Attorney-General seeking a widening of the terms of reference ...In other words, the commissioner is saying that he has ample power to make findings of fact. If he needs a widening of the terms of reference to make a finding that an offence has taken place, as distinct from an extension of some finding of fact, he will approach the Commonwealth. I have already indicated - and I hope I do not presume, on the authority of the Attorney-General, to repeat this indication - that, if the commissioner were to seek an extension of the terms of reference, he would be granted that extension.The Leader of the Opposition is without substance in this allegation. This government has been transparent. This government has established an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. We are now drawing to the end and how many questions must it be - 60, 70 or 80? - 110! It is a world record in futility. They have had 110 opportunities to actually finger some misbehaviour by an officer of the Commonwealth, to establish some link between the allegations made against AWB Ltd - and they are at the moment only allegations. Whatever people may say about the conduct of that company, the members and the officers of that company are entitled to due process. That due process requires people to at least wait until the commissioner has made a finding and to at least wait until all the directors of the company have had an opportunity to express their points of view.Let me say again lest there be any doubt in the minds of anybody in this parliament: no knowledge in relation to the alleged bribery by AWB Ltd was in the possession of members of my government - in my or any of my colleagues possession - at the time those offences occurred. - If in fact they did occur. On the evidence I have seen -  - I do not believe that any officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been guilty of misconduct or guilty of negligence. But these are matters properly left to the commissioner. No government in the world has been as transparent as this government has been. Not only do we have an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission but day by day, not every second day but every day that this parliament has sat, all of my ministers, from me down, have been here in the parliament, answering questions on this subject. The Leader of the Opposition carries on about accountability. The ultimate test of an accountable government is its willingness and its capacity, where allegations are made, to establish an independent inquiry to get to the truth of those allegations, coupled with a willingness to make itself accountable every day, not every second day, before the parliament of this nation. On that test alone this has been a very accountable government. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: you have had all the time in the world to make your case, and you have failed miserably.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I recognise his concern and the concern of many others to protect taxpayers' interests but at the same time ensure that those people entitled to welfare receive it. Fraud in the welfare system is like a cancer: it has a profound impact on recipients and it has a profound impact on the credibility of the system. I can report on a previously unreported operation conducted by Victoria Police and Centrelink in the last few days - that is, Operation Oxford. This involved a roadblock in which 500 vehicles were stopped for inspections and drivers licence checking. Of the 500 vehicles stopped, 220 commercial drivers, including taxi drivers and courier drivers, were questioned by Centrelink. This operation identified 13 welfare recipients who were working without declaring their earnings. These people have now had payments cancelled, saving the taxpayer $100,000 a year. Another 20 people are having their cases and records closely examined.Last year Centrelink undertook 133 of these special covert operations, which resulted in over 10,000 reviews of welfare payments to individuals. This generated savings to the taxpayer of more than $30 million in one year alone. We are determined to crack down on welfare fraud and we issue a general warning: if people are engaged in fraudulent activity in relation to welfare, we will get them.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question, and the reason I appreciate the question is that I have wanted to make a couple of points about this. The first is that there is no evidence that money paid by AWB Ltd to Alia, which we now believe went to the Iraqis, was subsequently paid to Palestinian suicide bombers. The second point I want to make is that it is true -  - How do I know there is no evidence? - Oh, you genius, you! Mr Speaker, they are so brainy! The second serious point I make is this: I have said at this dispatch box over the years that Saddam Hussein did provide financial support to Palestinian suicide bombers. But from March 2003 he has paid no money to Palestinian suicide bombers. He cannot, because we got rid of him. Whereas if the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition had maintained their policy he would still be financing Palestinian suicide bombers. Go and tell that to the Israelis!</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. The truth is that today marks the introduction of legislation that will continue the process of economic reform that is so necessary to maintain the economic growth of this country. I ask a rhetorical question of the opposition: why is it that this economy has performed so well? It is because of ongoing -  -  - Oh, did you! Can we have that again? It is because they did. Oh, deary me, I have been in total ignorance of that fact for 10 years and so have 20 million Australians! These reforms are not extreme; these reforms are measured improvement to the labour market laws of this country. Now that they are implemented we will still have a labour market that is more highly regulated than the labour market of New Zealand or the United Kingdom. The truth is that this country's continued economic prosperity is dependent upon having people in charge who have the courage to continue the process of reform. By his question, the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated that he lacks the courage to embrace the reforms that are needed for Australia's future.</DOC>

 - Can I take the last part of the question first and say that there is an alternative view: it is the do-nothing alternative of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has had 10 years. He may not have been leader for the whole of that 10 years but, for the period that he was not leader of the Labor Party, he was a person of great influence and stature in the Australian Labor Party. He has effectively had 10 years to come to terms with the reality that, when you are thrown out of office after a long period of government, you have got to do something about policy reform before you can be taken seriously by the Australian public. The Leader of the Opposition has had 10 years to develop an alternative, and his only alternative is to say, 'Anything good that happens in the Australian economy now is due to what the Hawke and Keating governments did.'Let me say, in contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, I have always been willing to give the former Labor government a bit of credit for one or two things that it did do that were very good such as picking up the Campbell reforms which the former government, under my treasurership, initiated, and also the dismantling of tariff protection. That process has gone on under this government, and the reason that we are so prosperous is that this government - unlike the opposition - has had the intellectual and policy commitment to the reform process.I am pleased to report that, since 1996, real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. How much did they rise under the former government? They rose 1.2 per cent over 13 years. We have created 1.7 million jobs over the last 10 and a bit years. But the message is that the process of economic reform is an ongoing one. We live in a globalised, fast-changing world and, unless this country is prepared to continually embrace reform, it will lose economic momentum and it will see jobs begin to disappear. No industrial relations system can guarantee to insulate a workforce against a downturn. The Leader of the Opposition is now arguing against our industrial relations policies in favour of his industrial relations prescription which, in the early 1990s, saw a million Australians thrown out of work. You can regulate the Australian labour market - you can regulate it to a point of strangulation - but, if you do not have a strong economy, jobs will be lost and wages will go backwards rather than forwards.The test of our industrial relations reforms is not so much the level of regulation or deregulation. The test is: will they improve the strength of the Australian economy? Will they encourage more investment? Will they encourage more risk-taking by entrepreneurs? Will they encourage the making of bargains at a workplace level between Australian workers and their employers? The answer overwhelmingly to all of those questions is yes. That is why these reforms are good for Australia, and that is why the Leader of the Opposition represents the backward-looking policy approach that he has embraced for the last 10 years.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest. The Australian government, and I think Australians in general, are committed to a deep and abiding relationship with Indonesia. After all, Indonesia is not just a very substantial nation in our region and a country with which we have long historic ties but, importantly, as the country with the world's largest Islamic community, also a shining example of a democratic and pluralistic society. That is a point that we as a government have been making to our friends from the United Kingdom and the United States over the last couple of weeks.Of course, there is some controversy at the moment about the decision by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to grant temporary protection visas to 42 Indonesians from Papua province. The Indonesian reaction to this decision is understandable and has not come as a great surprise to us, but I repeat what I have said once before and what I think the Prime Minister has been saying too, and that is that the decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs are made by individual decision-makers in accordance with both international law and Australian law. This in no way means that Australia has changed its policy or its approach to the question of the province of Papua. We recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the province of Papua; we do not support any secessionist movement or attempts of other kinds to achieve separation from Indonesia in Papua.Let me also say that the government has been very impressed with the efforts made by President Yudhoyono to achieve wide-ranging autonomy in Aceh province. I think the president's initiatives in Aceh have been very successful. Let me also add that we do welcome the President's commitment to finding a peaceful, just and dignified resolution in Papua, based also on the principles of special autonomy. Indonesia has shown it can resolve its own problems in its own way through dialogue. It did that in Aceh, and I am sure that the government of Indonesia will endeavour to do the same thing in Papua.In the meantime, the Australian government very much values the friendship and cooperation that we have with Indonesia. That cooperation is in our mutual interest to help fight terrorism, to help deal with illegal fishing and to help deal with people smugglers and illegal people movements - and so the list goes on. I think it is important that it is recognised as being in both of our interests to achieve those things, and we will do what we can to ensure that that close friendship continues.</DOC>

 - In answering that question, let me turn first of all to the remarks made by the President of the Industrial Relations Commission. I did see those remarks. Let me say that I do not share his view and we will just -  - No. Let me say that I do not share his view and we shall see. - I think the public will pay on performance, just as they have over the last 10 years when we have seen real wages go up by 16.8 per cent. So I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her interjection. The public is interested in results, and the side of politics that has the runs on the board when it comes to real wages is the Liberal and National parties. The real wage suppressors were the Australian Labor Party; the real wage enlargers and enhancers have been the coalition parties.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. I can inform him that the Treasury, in its round-up, has today released estimates of net private sector wealth featuring data to June 2005. The data shows that net private sector wealth grew 11.8 per cent in nominal terms over the last year. Net private sector wealth in Australia now stands at $6.2 trillion - around $305,000 for every Australian - and over the last 10 years net private sector wealth in Australia has more than doubled. That means that, on average, Australians over the last 10 years have twice the level of wealth that they had before the government was elected.This is reflected not only in property values but particularly in business assets. Business assets have grown extremely strongly in recent years, with company profits as a proportion of GDP being the highest ever recorded in Australia. In particular, Australia has become one of the great share-owning democracies of the world. There are more Australians who own shares, as a proportion of the public, here in Australia than anywhere else in the world.The government's policies of locking in low inflation, locking in low interest rates, of improving the macro-economic climate and of improving structural policy have contributed to an extended period of economic growth, low unemployment and business profitability, and all Australians are seeing that reflected in private sector wealth. We cannot sit back and say that we will now rest on our laurels. It is important that we drive economic policy forward, just as we have done over the last 10 years, against the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, which objected to balancing the budget, objected to monetary policy, objected to the repayment of debt, objected to the introduction of GST, objected to the halving of capital gains tax, objected to the reduction in the company tax rate and objected to last year's income tax cuts. Over the last 10 years all of the big economic changes in this country have been driven through against the objections of the Australian Labor Party and its do-nothing leadership. We have seen the results today - the reforms of yesterday - and it is the reforms of today which will lead to the results of tomorrow and these are the policies Australia needs to drive it forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. As a former sugar producer, the member for Page understands too well the importance of reform in the multilateral trading system that we are trying to achieve through the Doha Round of negotiations. It was interesting and pleasing to hear the comments of the British Prime Minister in this chamber earlier today on his commitment to reform in this area. It goes without saying that Australian farmers, manufacturers and service providers all stand to benefit enormously if we can further liberalise the multilateral global trading system.It has certainly been the objective of our government for the entirety of our term in this place to continue to push that forward. We are getting to a critical stage in terms of what can be done, and we must do this not just on behalf of Australia's exporters and Australian businesses but also for poverty stricken countries, which deserve a better go at accessing the markets of the world. So we are pursuing an ambitious outcome in the Doha Round not only for our exporters, particularly our farmers, in an attempt to keep our economy strong but also to help the poverty stricken people in developing countries across the world. The World Bank estimates that breaking down all the barriers to international merchandise trade would lift 32 million people out of poverty. We could help 32 million people just by liberalising further in the area of international merchandise trade, not to mention by removing the obscene support - which we certainly intend to try and remove - that is provided to agriculture in wealthy countries.As I said, I welcome the statement by Prime Minister Blair just a few hours ago, in which he said, 'The EU agriculture policy is born of another age and must end.' We agree with him 100 per cent. That is the message that consecutive Australian trade ministers from both sides of politics have continued to deliver. Certainly we need to continue to push that point. As Mr Blair said, it is also important that large developing countries are prepared to make a contribution to opening up their markets as far as industrial goods are concerned. There needs to be movement by the European Union on market access for agricultural products. There needs to be movement by large industrialised developing countries such as Brazil, India, China and others to open up their markets as far as industrial goods and services are concerned. Ultimately that will benefit the entire multilateral system, but most importantly it will help millions of people who are poverty stricken today who could be lifted out of poverty in the future. The objective of the Australian government is to continue to pursue those goals in the interests of those poverty stricken countries and also to help keep the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

I will just complete the quotes with the parts that the Leader of the Opposition failed to read out to the House. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services said in his speech: 'I am not in any way seeking to condone activities that are not appropriate. We do have high business standards and ethics in Australia, and even if they are not shared in other parts of the world that does not mean that we should compromise our standards or in any way compromise things that are inappropriate.'

 - First, may I just say to the member for Leichhardt how deeply I, and I know all of his colleagues, feel for him and his colleagues in adjoining seats whose constituents have suffered so disastrously as a result of Cyclone Larry. As it was a category 5 event, we knew to expect the worst of this tropical cyclone as it struck North Queensland exactly a week ago. We now know that our worst fears were very much realised when we saw the outcome. The scenes of devastation in places like Innisfail, Babinda and surrounding regions have been unimaginable to those of us who have not lived through or experienced a cyclone. The government's response to this disaster, through Emergency Management Australia, has been immediate and comprehensive. Within hours of the cyclone crossing the coast, EMA had organised the Commonwealth Counter-Disaster Task Force to meet and to deal with requests for assistance from the Queensland government.This reflects, of course, the major strength of our well-tried and tested cross-jurisdictional emergency management arrangements. It recognises that operational decisions are best made at a state level by state authorities who are in a position to assess priorities of need on the ground and then, through EMA, the Commonwealth can respond quickly and effectively to requests for assistance and coordination across all government agencies. To date, 35 formal requests have been received and acted upon, involving 11 government agencies. This cooperation has ensured that food and water, tarpaulins, showers, sanitation equipment, generators, satellite imagery and - members might be surprised - even milking machines have been provided to assist in the recovery effort. There are now over 400 defence personnel in North Queensland working closely with the state and federal agencies to help the devastated communities as they begin the process of rebuilding their homes, their businesses and their lives. I would like to thank my colleague the Minister for Defence for the cooperation of the troops. Perhaps he will convey our collective thanks to them for the tasks that they are undertaking.All agencies involved have been exemplary in responding to this disaster and in helping the communities to get back on their feet in what are very difficult and trying circumstances. I know that with the leadership and the expertise of our former Chief of Defence, Peter Cosgrove, the people of Far North Queensland will benefit considerably. We stand ready to assist. We will continue to provide, where possible, whatever further assistance we can reasonably provide to assist the people of North Queensland.</DOC>

He is a person whose public comments, I think it can be fairly said, do not reflect a bias one way or the other as far as Australian politics are concerned. I think his proposition of lack of moral fibre in relation to people who deliberately set out to breach the sanctions imposed by the United Nations, or connived in that, is perfectly correct, and I support it. I do not agree for a moment that the government has been guilty of that conduct - absolutely not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I know she is very concerned about human rights issues and I appreciate her asking the question. Not surprisingly, the Australian government regards it as repugnant for anybody to be punished for the religious beliefs that they hold. We have made that very clear to the government of Afghanistan. We have made it clear that our fundamental support is for the principle that all people should be free to practise their religions, regardless of what their religions are. Of course, our opposition to the death penalty is well known.Last week I instructed my department to call in the Afghanistan ambassador to relay our strong concerns back to his government in Kabul that an Afghan citizen was apparently facing the death sentence over a change of his religious beliefs from Islam to Christianity. The Prime Minister subsequently wrote to President Karzai of Afghanistan to express the government's view that it is offensive to our values and our way of life to prosecute Mr Rahman, particularly when Australian soldiers are in that country risking their lives in fighting the Taliban.I must say that I warmly welcome the media reports today - which, let me hasten to add, have not been confirmed - that Mr Rahman's case has been referred back to Afghanistan's Attorney-General for further review, because of what are described as gaps in the evidence, and that Mr Rahman will be released from custody pending the review. I do hope that the charges against Mr Rahman will be dropped and that freedom of religion, in practice as well as in theory, will be respected in the newly democratic Afghanistan. We will continue to monitor the progress of the case and we will continue to press the government of Afghanistan on this issue.This is not a question, for Australia's part, of promoting Christianity at the expense of Islam, or about Islamic values versus non-Islamic values, or whatever it may be. Rather, as Prime Minister Blair said today in his speech right here in the House of Representatives, we believe there are some universal values that we should stand up for - and those values are the right of all global citizens, not just some. The freedom of individuals to practise whatever religion they choose is one of those values.</DOC>

 - There was certainly a phrase in that question which was the pot calling the kettle black. I think the House knows exactly which phrase I am referring to. The government most certainly did not cover up any Australian company breaching sanctions. The simple point is that the Australian government has maintained and supported United Nations sanctions. At no time has the Australian government ever made a decision, ever announced a decision or signed a decision to suggest that we would weaken our commitment to United Nations sanctions. The proposition that somehow this government would have been in favour -  - of breaching sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime is a proposition that absolutely no-one in the Australian community would accept - and quite rightly so. It is a completely absurd proposition.A lot of evidence has been put to the Cole inquiry. Officers from the department that is led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and by me have been before the Cole commission. In none of that evidence - at none of those hearings - is there any evidence that those officers of my department have been trying to cover up. - The genius from Western Australia says, 'What about me?' as though somehow I am out there conducting some conspiracy separate from the officials in some series of secret meetings - which is obviously manifest nonsense as well. - The fact is that the officials from my department have made it perfectly clear that there has been no attempt at a cover-up and no attempt to turn a blind eye, and there has been no evidence presented to the Cole commission to support that proposition. My meeting with Mr Volcker was very friendly and it was right at the end of the Volcker process. It was a meeting which I asked to have because I could see that the Volcker commission was likely to have critical things to say about AWB Ltd. The onus of that discussion was that AWB should be able to see a draft copy of the report and comment on it before the final report was produced. I can absolutely assure the House there was nothing dramatic or exciting in that meeting at all - no matter what, by the way, Tony Walker may claim.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. If one were to believe the rhetoric coming from the trade union movement and the Labor Party, then marauding groups of employers would be pillaging every right and protection of workers throughout Australia today. That is what their rhetoric says - which is quite a nonsense. There are a number of safeguards in this new legislation for employees. For example, the government has substantially beefed up the role of the Office of Workplace Services. Indeed, over the next four years we will expend some $140 million on the Office of Workplace Services. We will almost treble the number of workplace inspectors and, importantly, for the first time, where there is an alleged infringement of the legislation, the inspectorate itself will be able to prosecute an employer who has done the wrong thing - something which simply did not exist last week.In addition to that, with Australian workplace agreements we have made some substantial changes to protect young people. For example, a young person below the age of 18 cannot enter into an Australian workplace agreement - that is, an individual agreement - without the consent and indeed the signature of their parent or guardian. There are a range of other safeguards in this legislation - for example, protection of people's right to join or not to join a union, protection against discrimination and the right of an employee to have a bargaining agent appointed. Importantly, the unlawful dismissal provisions in the legislation remain in place. That means that if someone seeks to dismiss an employee because of their race, because of their religious beliefs, because of the colour of their skin, because they are pregnant or because they have family responsibilities not only is it unlawful but, if an employee makes a claim, the onus falls on the employer to disprove the claim brought by the employee. In addition to that, we have decided to provide $4,000 worth of financial assistance to eligible employees for legal advice on the merits of their case.One other change that the honourable member for Boothby alluded to was the decision by the government, which is reflected in this legislation, to get rid of Labor's legacy of crippling unfair dismissal laws. These are laws that have cost Australians jobs. They have been frequently abused and watered down, and they have led to a huge impost on small business. - The member for Lyons asks me to prove it. A recent survey showed that the average cost to a small or medium business in Australia of an unfair dismissal claim was some $15,000. So what we have had in the past is employers facing up to $15,000, on average, to pay 'go-away money' to get rid of a problem, which is simply bad policy. I note in this context that just recently the Leader of the Opposition said in a joint media release with his shadow spokesman the member for Perth:We recognise this is not a debate about whether employers are good or bad. Most Australians act in good faith, whether they're employers or employees.But there are some rogue employers, just as there are rogue employees.What the Leader of the Opposition wants is to reimpose the draconian system of unfair dismissals on small and medium businesses in Australia, and not only to retain one tribunal in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission but to add more red tape and bureaucracy for small and medium businesses in Australia by imposing yet another tribunal on small and medium businesses in Australia. We do not need another bureaucracy. We do not need more imposition of red tape on small and medium businesses. We want a change in the laws, which will come into effect today, which will give small and medium businesses in Australia the opportunity to employ more of our fellow Australians.</DOC>

 - Firstly, let me say in relation to the last part of the question that throughout all the hearings of the Cole inquiry - I do not mean the media reporting of it but the hearings of the Cole inquiry - there has been no evidence that the government has been involved in a cover-up. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. The Leader of the Opposition two months ago was not saying that it was a cover-up. The Leader of the Opposition was saying that the government was corrupt - that the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, other ministers and I were involved in corruption. 'The government is corrupt' has been abandoned and the new position is now that 'the government is involved in a cover-up'. The simple fact of the matter is that officials from my department have been before the Cole commission and there has been no evidence from those officials that the government has been involved in a cover-up at all. No amount of assertion from the opposition will change the truth.Here it talks about a cable that came in, and an officer of my department absolutely and quite diligently did follow up that cable - and I call on people who have but a passing interest in this issue to look at the transcript of the evidence of the Cole inquiry. Ms Zena Armstrong is a very able and very decent officer of my department - and I stand up for Zena Armstrong. She is a good woman and she is a decent woman. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. It shows how little you know about government officials any more. You have drifted away into the wilderness of opposition for a decade. You do not know these people and you do not know their modus operandi. You do not know the sort of people we are dealing with. - Mr Speaker, the point I make is that Zena Armstrong did follow this up, and I think she followed it up in an appropriate way. The point here is that if the Cole commission were to find that AWB Ltd knowingly paid kickbacks - and we will await the results of the Cole commission - they have done so in defiance of the government, in defiance of the United Nations and by all accounts - though this is yet to be fully tested in the Cole commission - in a way that was designed to obscure their actions from their very own board. - It is as simple as that. These spurious and empty allegations of the opposition deserve to be rejected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his obvious interest in the people of North Queensland and also the member for Leichhardt, who clearly sits next to him. It has been a tragic time in Far North Queensland, as everybody is very much aware. There has been extensive damage throughout the north. As Prime Minister Blair indicated today, the great resilience of these people under great adversity needs to be warmly acknowledged and congratulated. The Commonwealth stood ready to immediately help get individual families and communities back on their feet. I would like to inform the House of some of the very significant assistance the federal government is offering to people of Far North Queensland at this difficult time.We have announced ex-gratia payments to people whose family homes were destroyed or where, through loss of power or other amenities, they were unable to inhabit those homes for a minimum of two weeks - $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child. The federal government made a million-dollar donation to the Cyclone Larry Relief Fund. I take this opportunity to congratulate the fans of Townsville who went along to the Cowboys game on the weekend for their great generosity - about $140,000, I believe, was donated on that one occasion, showing how they are supporting their country cousins in Far North Queensland. - Yes, they also won - a great outcome. For eligible farmers and small businesses there is a one-off income support program equivalent to Newstart allowance for six months and there will be no asset test applied in relation to the capital value of the farm or the business assets. There will also be one-off, tax-free grants of $10,000 for existing small and home based businesses, including farmers and tourism operators, adversely affected by the cyclone. Farmers have obviously been very heavily hit - and we have seen some of the coverage particularly of banana farmers and sugarcane farmers - and loans of up to $200,000 under the natural disaster relief arrangements will be made available to them. An initial advance of $40 million has been agreed with the Queensland government for this financial year under the natural disaster relief arrangements and there will also be a one-off reimbursement for diesel and petrol excise on the presentation of receipts. My colleague the Minister for Human Services has arranged for 60 of his staff in the Centrelink offices to work at the 13 community recovery centres that will be be operating, and he informs me that another 80 staff will arrive in the area tomorrow to further assist people, with face-to-face human contact, so they can get their lives back in order.This has been a wonderful effort on behalf of the people of Far North Queensland, with the Queensland and federal governments working collaboratively in what have been incredibly trying times. The defence forces of Australia have again stood up, and I know the Minister for Defence has been up there and has already witnessed some of the fine work that they have undertaken, which just goes to prove that our defence forces do a great job onshore and offshore in times of need for this nation. This is a comprehensive package. The federal government will continue to monitor the situation and work with all concerned to ensure that North Queensland again gets back on its feet and becomes a productive part of Australia, as it always has been in the past and will continue to be into the future.</DOC>

 - First, I do not recall the exact nature of the conversation, but it is true I did have a conversation with Mr Lindberg around that time; I had a brief meeting with him. I do not know if that is exactly what I said; that has been asserted by somebody in the Cole commission. Comments that were made were made on the premise that AWB was not responsible - that AWB had been behaving in a responsible way. My comments were made on the basis that we believed that AWB Ltd had endeavoured to adhere to Australian law and to the United Nations sanctions regime. As to whether they had used this trucking company, as we were of course increasingly finding out through the process of the Volcker inquiry, AWB continued to argue that any payments that went to the Iraqi regime through Alia were inadvertently made to the Iraqi regime. That is what they argued.Mr Speaker, I can give you a later meeting I had with AWB Ltd, not just that meeting. I can give you a meeting I had with AWB Ltd in about October, which is, I think, the last time I met them. At that meeting, yet again AWB Ltd asserted with great vehemence that they had not knowingly paid any kickbacks to the Iraqi regime. We certainly were of the view - my department was certainly of the view; the government, more broadly speaking, was of the view - that that was the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know how excited he and the people of Darwin are about this important new development. This is a government which takes seriously its responsibilities to help citizens, wherever they are, and the friends of Australia, wherever they are. To that end the government has committed $66 million to establish a national trauma response centre at Royal Darwin Hospital. This will improve Royal Darwin Hospital's ability to respond to terrorist acts and natural disasters in our region, as that hospital has done so magnificently in the past. This additional funding will provide a 10-bed burns unit, an additional 10 beds in the emergency unit, an additional five operating theatres, an emergency drugs stockpile and equipment including an MRI facility. There will be more permanent clinical staff and there will be more rapid deployment of staff. This is an important development in Australia's readiness to respond to terrorist contingencies and natural disasters and it is further evidence of this government's absolute determination to help our citizens and to help the friends of Australia, wherever they may be.</DOC>

 - We were talking earlier about the phrase 'characteristic diligence'. No-one would accuse the Leader of the Opposition of characteristic diligence. For a start, the Leader of the Opposition might be interested to know that it was not Australian money; it was money from the Iraqi sale of oil which was paid into a United Nations escrow account. That is the first point. The second point is that I would have thought the government had absolutely done the right thing by setting up the Cole inquiry -  - You don't think so? Well, I do. I think the Cole inquiry is doing a very good job. It is obtaining a wide amount of information. The Prime Minister and I have provided the Cole inquiry with all of our relevant documentation, and Commissioner Cole will draw his own conclusions. When he draws his conclusions, we will be able to talk about those conclusions. Did AWB Ltd deliberately and knowingly - or unknowingly - end up paying kickbacks through this trucking company into Iraq? That is something that the Cole commission is establishing. We certainly believed that AWB Ltd was adhering to Australian law. When I say 'we', I include myself, the Minister for Trade, the Prime Minister and other ministers, such as the minister for agriculture. I include members of the Australian Public Service, including desk officers in my department who are working day by day on these issues. We always did believe it.The one shock I got in all of this was when Mr Agius presented his initial findings in January this year, which suggested that AWB Ltd may have knowingly been paying kickbacks. That came as a great surprise to all of us. It simply illustrates the fact that we have done the right thing by setting up this inquiry. Material is coming out in the inquiry which is helpful to all of us. This is the message I would have for Mr Blair. Off the top of my head, a couple of hundred companies from other countries were - according to Volcker - involved in kickbacks to Iraq. - We, in our country, have set up a transparent process. I think other countries respect and appreciate -  - the transparency of our process.</DOC>

 - I think of a number of things in relation to the very interesting question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. - I will actually think of England. I will think of what the Prime Minister of Great Britain said: 'Fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' I will think of England, but I think more of Australia. I think more of the workers of Australia, and I care about them a lot more than those in the Australian Labor Party. That is why my proudest boast in the last election campaign, when I spoke to the men and women of Western Sydney, was that we had delivered higher wages, lower taxes, lower unemployment and vastly lower interest rates.There is nothing more absurd in the attack mounted by the Leader of the Opposition on the government's industrial relations policy than to say that our aim is to cut the wages of Australian workers. That is absurd because it defies history. 
An opposition member - Just give a guarantee now! - My guarantee is my record, and I am very proud of my record. I will tell you what: that record gets better and better. During the election campaign I could only talk of real wage increases of 14 per cent. Here we are, almost halfway through the current term, and the real wage increase has gone to 16.8 per cent. Amazingly, it has gone from about 13 per cent in the last 18 months to 16.8 per cent. Yet the Leader of the Opposition runs around saying that I am trying to cut wages. Apart from it being an exercise in stupidity and unfairness to try to cut wages, it flies in the face of the government's performance.Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: as the years go by and you look back on the inanity of your attack on these changes, you will be comforted by the fact that that inanity was matched by the absurdity of the allegations you made in 1996 that our changes were about cutting wages. In 1996 the Labor Party ran around the country saying that the Reith reforms were about cutting wages. Here we are, 10 years later - you are still over there and wages are up by 16.8 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his abiding interest in reform of the workplace relations system in Australia. Indeed I have seen some media reports of the ACTU beginning what it has called its 'naming and shaming' campaign. The target of the union vilification is a small Melbourne construction company that operates in the construction sector both commercially and domestically. This morning on AM the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, attacked this company and Work Choices because of three employees who were made redundant.Let me deal with the facts in this case rather than the wild rhetoric that has come from the ACTU. Firstly, these employees were indeed made redundant because of a downturn in work in the commercial building sector in Melbourne. Indeed, that is what the owner of the firm said on AM this morning. He said:Our work is predominantly sporadic anyway at the best of times.So here is a business dealing with sporadic work in the commercial sector and it has actually offered work in the domestic sector to these employees. Secondly, I am advised, even as I am speaking here, that arrangements for the redundancy provisions for these workers are being undertaken now and that these workers will get their full redundancy payout. The Office of Workplace Services, which I spoke about yesterday, has been boosted and will ensure that that provision does indeed operate.The third fact is the most telling in relation to this matter. We have had Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, on national radio this morning and in the press saying that these redundancies are as a result of the Work Choices legislation. The reality, the fact, is entirely true. These redundancies are the result of a certified agreement, certified in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 4 April 2003. One of the parties that took that agreement to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to put these provisions in place was none other than the CFMEU. If Mr Combet were going to be honest, he would be saying that what he is complaining about is an agreement put in place by the CFMEU for the building construction industry in Melbourne. But he is not saying that and the Leader of the Opposition knows that.Worse than that, there have been redundancies under this agreement over the couple of years since it has been put in place. Have we heard one word from Mr Combet or the Leader of the Opposition about previous redundancies under this agreement? This shows that this is a despicable campaign on the part of the ACTU. I remind the House that last year we had the President of the ACTU on the Lateline television program saying: 'What I need for my campaign is the family of a worker who has been injured or maimed. That would help our campaign.' This is outrageous. It is despicable. That is the first thing that can be said about this. The second is that this proves from the very outset - the very first case raised by the ACTU - that you cannot believe what they say. No doubt we will see more claims like this over the coming days as they trawl through to try to find more, but the very first case is an agreement with the CFMEU - what hypocrites!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for asking me a question about my record. I am delighted to tell him of my record. - Let me start by saying, firstly, that the real wages of Australian workers have risen by 16.8 -  - Let me start again. The real wages of Australian workers have risen by 16.8 per cent over the last 9½ years. In real terms, the federal minimum wage has risen by more than 12 per cent under the coalition. Australia's consistent economic growth and tax cuts in recent years have resulted in an increase in the disposable income of the average Australian production worker. They are the people the Labor Party used to be interested in before they abandoned them and embraced the chattering classes. There was a time when the Labor Party could speak with some heart and authenticity about production workers in this country, but they have long since ceased to bother about representing their interests in the Australian community.Let me remind the House that average household incomes in Australia have grown by no less than 20.7 per cent in real terms over the period 1994 to 2003-04. The real income of low- and middle-income households - let me emphasise this - has increased by a proportionately greater amount: that is, by 22 per cent. In other words, the Labor Party like to chatter and interject on a point like this - let them go ahead and try to silence me from reminding the Parliament of Australia that under this government the people have enjoyed the greatest increase in household disposable income -  - It used to be called muscling up but that expression is not very popular now because of the author of it. Since 1996, real net household wealth has risen by an average of 8.8 per cent a year. Australia's unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent in March 1996 -  - Australia's unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent in March 1996 to 5.3 per cent now. That is about a 30-year low. A total of 1.7 million new jobs have been created under the coalition. Inflation has been contained, averaging just 2.5 per cent per year. Finally, of enormous interest to the people the Labor Party used to try and represent - that is, the home buyers of Australia - household mortgage interest rates are about 7.3 per cent, well below the 17 per cent seen in the early 1990s and the 10.5 per cent in March 1996. On an average new mortgage of about $220,000, the reduction in interest rates since March 1996 saves Australian families about $585 a month in interest charges. I am delighted to be questioned by the opposition on my record.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. It is a very important question, because the free trade agreement that we negotiated with the United States was about not just the sale of agricultural products and commodities and industrial goods into the United States but also getting access to the United States for our service providers and our professionals. One of the most important things that we were able to achieve, which came through last year, was the establishment of the Australia-only E-3 visa - something we discussed during the negotiations which came through afterwards. It was part of the ongoing work that came out of the United States free trade agreement. This is a visa that allows 10,000 Australians to go and work in the United States every year. This was a significant outcome for Australian service providers, Australian professionals and Australian businesses operating in the United States.Today I am able to announce that Australian certified practising accountants can now apply for a licence to work in 39 US states without having to do any extra study. Their Australian qualifications have been recognised in 39 states of the United States. This is good news for Australian accountants. It is good news for Australian companies that have business operations and want to use Australian CPAs in their US operations. Our lawyers and engineers are also currently meeting with their US counterparts to harmonise the mutual recognition of qualifications across the Pacific. This is a very important outcome that we have laid a platform for in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. Earlier this month when I met with my counterpart, USTR ambassador Rob Portman, we agreed on a proposal to continue to work together to implement these important agreements - to work with industry groups, to work with professional organisations and to enhance and expand the exchange of professionals across the Pacific.We all recall the difficulty the Labor Party had in supporting the free trade agreement with the United States. I will acknowledge that, to his credit, the then backbencher and member for Brand was one of the strong supporters of the free trade agreement, but everybody else followed the former member for Werriwa in trying to scuttle the US free trade agreement that has delivered so much for Australia -  - The interjection by the member for Griffith is about sugar. Last year our sugar exporters exported an extra 52,000 tonnes of sugar into the US market. Whereas part of the agreement we negotiated with the United States was to eliminate the 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna, today we have had word from the Port Lincoln tuna processors - and I am sure the member for Grey will be very pleased to hear this - that they are sending their first shipment of 10 containers of canned tuna - processed, manufactured, product - out of South Australia into the United States as a result of the US free trade agreement. We remember that most of those opposite, following the member for Werriwa, tried to scuttle the deal that we put together.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question is no. Let me remind the House and the Leader of the Opposition that, as from the coming into operation of the law, the former unfair dismissal measures - which, I remind the parliament, were only introduced into the law of Australia in 1994 as a result of a deal made secretly between the ACTU and the then Keating government: they do not date back to Magna Carta or to Federation; they were only introduced in 1994 - have been repealed in relation to firms that employ fewer than 100 people. We make no bones about that. We have been very up front about that change. It is a change that we believe will remove a disincentive that existed under the former law in relation to smaller firms in particular when taking on new staff.But can I remind the Leader of the Opposition, given the breadth of his question, that there are matters and grounds on which employment must not be terminated. I think that, in the light of what he has said and what many other people have said, it is worth going through these. It is worth reminding the parliament that you cannot have your employment terminated because of temporary absence from work because of illness or injury. You cannot have your employment terminated by reason of trade union membership or participation in trade union activities. Equally, you cannot have your employment terminated for non-membership of a trade union or for seeking office or acting or having acted in the capacity of a representative of employees, or for filing a complaint or participation in proceedings against an employer on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status or family responsibilities.I mention that specifically in relation to the quite misleading advertisement run by the ACTU which clearly implies that a mother is being threatened with the sack because she cannot go to work because her child is ill. That is unlawful. It was unlawful under the former law and it is unlawful under the current law. The advertisement by the ACTU is an absolute disgrace. If you really have the interests of working people at heart - every time I see Mr Combet on the television he talks about his concern for working people - you do not demonstrate your concern for working people by scaring them with dishonest advertisements. You represent your concern for working people by arguing legitimately. You cannot be sacked for refusing to negotiate, make, sign, extend, vary or terminate an AWA. You cannot be sacked for absence from work during maternity leave or other parental leave or for temporary absence from work because of the carrying out of a voluntary emergency management activity.In addition, the government has included an additional protection in section 615 which makes it unlawful for an employer to dismiss or threaten to dismiss an employee for reasonably refusing to work on public holidays. To claim unlawful termination - and I ask the opposition to listen to this carefully - an employee need only make the allegation that he or she was terminated for an unlawful reason -  - and the burden of proof then rests on the employer to disprove the claim. In other words, we have restored balance to these laws, and it is a balance that is going to result in increased job opportunities and great additional benefits and opportunities for Australian small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. I can inform him that, as part of a six-monthly review, the Reserve Bank today has published a financial stability review of the Australian financial system. It finds that the banking system remains well capitalised and highly profitable, with bad debt levels that are low by both historical and international experience. It also notes that the rate of credit growth has been slowing in Australia from rates of about 20 per cent for household credit growth in 2003 and early 2004 to rates of about 13 per cent in 2006. Similarly, personal credit growth has slowed from around 15 per cent to 10 per cent in the same period.The Reserve Bank also notes that households do seem to be taking a slightly more cautious approach to finances. Again, if the household sector is saving a little more, that would be a welcome thing. We are seeing a rebalancing of growth in the Australian economy out of consumption and towards the export sector. You cannot maintain credit growth at 20 per cent per annum year after year without that catching up with areas where the economy becomes unbalanced. To see stability arising in relation to the housing market and to see some slowing in relation to credit growth is actually quite a welcome thing.The Reserve Bank also notes in its report that banks are moving to higher ratios in some of their loans and seem to be moving increasingly to what are called 'low doc' loans, where there is less supervision and more self-verification in the application process. The Reserve Bank notes that banks need to be careful that they do not overly relax credit standards, and that is something the government would most certainly endorse. This is a good report of a sound and stable financial system, which has been given by the Reserve Bank, noting important developments in the economy.While I am on the subject of stability, I should also note another area of stability, in the political firmament, that I think all members of the House would want me to acknowledge and welcome, and that is that we on both sides of the House are very pleased to see that the member for Hotham has been re-endorsed in his preselection. We congratulate him for standing up to the roosters - the Shorten, Conroy, Pakula group - who tried to execute him in a chicken cull! The roosters went on a chicken cull! - On the importance of stability to the financial system and politics generally - whilst we welcome the return of the member for Hotham - the member for Corio and the member for Maribyrnong, I think, have the sympathy of both sides of this House, having fallen in a cull by the roosters, undeserved, and they deserve our empathy.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and for the interest in this agreement. With him being a Western Australian and thinking a lot about India, as you do over there, I can understand him asking the question. The government welcome the agreement between the United States and India essentially for three reasons. First of all, we do welcome the strengthening of the strategic relationship between the United States and India. We believe that that is very much in Australia's interests. Secondly, it does mean that India's civilian nuclear facilities will be under international safeguards and subject to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and we welcome that. Thirdly, obviously, India, with a vast population and a quite rapidly growing economy, is going to have very serious challenges in getting sufficient energy, and it needs clean energy. We do not want to see India using, if you like, unclean energy. Nuclear energy is obviously an option for a country like that.We have no current intentions to change our policy on uranium sales, but of course India's plan to bring its civil sector under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards is a matter of considerable interest to us. Therefore, officials from my department and other departments will meet their Indian and United States counterparts to discuss the form and substance of the agreement between India and the United States. This agreement needs still to pass the United States congress. It is going to be discussed in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which we are a member. I note during the visit by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, he welcomed and strongly supported this agreement. Of course, that is the position of a number of countries, such as France and Russia. Other countries can see many positive aspects of it and are having consultations with the Indians and the Americans about it.The honourable member for Forrest asked if there are any alternatives. On that side of the House 23 March is a bit of an anniversary. It is the second anniversary of Mark Latham's famous 'troops out by Christmas' statement. It is a day apparently commemorated in the Labor Party, a day when they make foreign policy speeches. The Leader of the Opposition made a foreign policy speech - which we can come back to on other occasions - and in that speech he said that this agreement between India and the United States showed a 'serious error of judgment' and was 'a major policy mistake' and, if he were to become the Prime Minister, he would 'wind back' an agreement. So the Leader of the Opposition would become the Prime Minister of Australia and he would then wind back the agreement between India and the United States!Let us be frank about this: that is, I suspect, hyperbole at its worst. Even if he wanted to wind it back, you can rest assured that he would have no capacity whatsoever to do so. What this simply demonstrates is that the Leader of the Opposition has worked very hard to try to persuade commentators that he is some sort of an expert on foreign policy and trade. He is a charlatan. He is a complete charlatan. He knows very little about those issues, and this kind of remark simply demonstrates the point - a point that is only reinforced by - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. Let me acknowledge the extraordinary effort undertaken by him and by the member for Leichhardt - the two federal members whose areas have been most directly affected by this cyclone. When I visited Innisfail and surrounding areas, I was greatly assisted and advised by both those members. Their constant contact with my office and with me personally since then, I continue to appreciate. In the nature of things, the assistance that the government gives on an occasion such as this must always be seen as a work in progress. You start by providing some initial assistance and, as circumstances are better understood, you make some changes. As my answer will reveal, there are a couple of further things that I can indicate, which I know will be of interest to all members of the House.The estimate of 3,500 to 4,000 has been made by a number of people. It is perhaps a little early to know whether that is accurate, but certainly jobs are at risk as a result of this natural disaster and the government will do everything it can to ensure that the number of people who lose their positions is kept to a minimum and that opportunities are given for re-employment. The best thing that the two governments can do is to get the private sector in this part of Australia going again because, with small business going again, people will be employed or, alternatively, will not lose their jobs. I can confirm that the government is examining the arrangement involving the Newstart benefit. As indicated in the honourable member's question, it was a proposition put to me last week by the member for Leichhardt as well and it is an issue that we are looking at closely.The member for Kennedy suggests that the ultimate amount to be spent - I know it is only an early estimate - might be about $30 million. I have to, with great respect, disagree with that. For example, the federal government has already - and it happened late last week - prepaid to the Queensland government some $40 million as a down payment on its share of the natural disaster arrangements that are going to be picked up. I would estimate conservatively the amount - and this is once again based on the best advice I have at the moment; it can vary and I do not want to be made a hostage to this figure - as far as the federal government is concerned, to be well in excess of $100 million. It may in fact go much higher than that, depending on the duration of the reconstruction period and the extent to which the concessional loans offered by the federal government are taken up.In relation to the concessional loans, I can indicate that the government is looking at some expansion of the eligibility criteria. These are loans that are made available in cooperation with the state government through the natural disaster relief arrangements. We originally announced $200,000 maximum, of which 25 per cent would be a direct cash grant with no repayments of principal or interest in the first two years, with interest being at four per cent, therefore projecting a repayment period of about nine years. I think in anybody's language that is a highly concessional loan and will be of enormous value to many hundreds of small businesses in the area. Questions have been raised as to whether the eligibility criteria, which include a ceiling of the equivalent of 20 full-time employees, might be a bit harsh. I am looking at that. I am, in principle, quite open to some change to make that more generous because, although 20 full-time positions - not 20 on a head count - will pick up most of the firms, there could be significant employers of people in the banana industry in particular who might not be helped by that. So I am looking at that and also at whether the principal of the loan might be somewhat higher in certain circumstances than the $200,000.I also inform the House that we have decided on a refinement to the diesel excise relief that I announced on Sunday. I indicated then that we would rebate in full, subject to an offset for any rebates people currently receive, the excise paid on diesel or petrol for power generation for homes and businesses where normal power supplies have not been restored. I said then that we would pay it on the basis of receipts and, because it was to be dated from the time of the disaster, a statutory declaration in lieu of receipt to cover the period before the announcement of the benefit was made. The government has decided that, while it will be open to people to submit receipts, it would be simpler and it would deliver the assistance more effectively if the payments were made by Centrelink on a fixed monthly basis. The figures decided are $280 a month where a household is without reliable electricity and $560 a month where a business is without reliable electricity. These payments will date with effect from the day the cyclone hit, which was 20 March 2006. These payments will be free of tax and we expect that payments will begin to be made by Friday. People who have a higher rate of claim - they use more fuel than this rebate would recompense - can still claim on the basis of actual fuel usage, but processing will be slower than the flat rate option. I think members will appreciate that this is a speedier way of delivering this assistance, and I am particularly indebted to the member for Leichhardt for the representations that he has made to me on this matter.I think everybody wants to help in relation to this. Can I record the fact that there has been outstanding cooperation between the federal and the Queensland governments. I have kept in regular touch with the Queensland Premier and he has kept in regular touch with me. I spoke earlier today to General Cosgrove, and I know all Australians will congratulate him on this latest demonstration of what a fine Australian citizen he is and what a great leader of men and women General Cosgrove represents.It has been a difficult time for the people of Far North Queensland. Providentially, there have been, perhaps except in one instance, no deaths as a result of this cyclone. That speaks volumes for the warnings and it speaks volumes for the commonsense of the people. I hope in the weeks ahead that we will all continue to work together to help our fellow Australians to put this disaster behind them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt and I acknowledge his contribution, as the Prime Minister has just outlined, and that of the members for Herbert and Dawson, who I understand have also visited the devastated region. Also to Mr Katter and to people within his electorate, congratulations for the outstanding support you have all provided. Like all Australians, we were touched by the dreadful situation that occurred after Cyclone Larry. The tremendous outpouring of support from many thousands of Australians to help their fellow Australians who were devastated by Cyclone Larry is a great credit to them and underscores the Australian spirit that is alive and well.The Australian Taxation Office has been supporting people in Far North Queensland and helping to facilitate support to those people who are most in need, in particular small business people who might have difficulty submitting business activity statements and people who may have lost their advice in relation to tax matters or tax records. The Australian Taxation Office has assisted people to reconstruct records. I have instructed the Australian Taxation Office to assist those people wherever possible.The last thing I want to say is in relation to the announcement last week, to which the Prime Minister alluded earlier, about the ongoing tax deductibility status of the Queensland Premier's relief fund and the $10,000 tax-free grant to small businesses and farmers. On Sunday the Prime Minister also spoke in some detail - and he clarified this earlier in question time - of the exact assistance we are able to provide to North Queensland people affected by Cyclone Larry with the diesel or petrol fuel rebate. It is a fantastic, collaborative effort. I congratulate all of those involved in both the Australian government and the Queensland government. All of us want to help wherever we can those people who were most adversely affected by Cyclone Larry, and I can assure the Australian people that the Australian Taxation Office and other government instrumentalities will be providing every assistance to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and for her interest. As I have told the House before, when I participated in the launch of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate I did so with a number of my colleagues - the Prime Minister himself participated in the opening ceremony - and it brought together ministers from Australia, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States as well as leaders from business and industry.The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which is known as AP6, established a policy implementation committee and task forces. They are ready to implement the ambitious work plans of the AP6. The committee and task forces will begin their first substantial meetings in the United States during next month. The task forces will, for example, identify major flagship projects to demonstrate breakthrough climate technologies, and Australia will be sending about 45 delegates to this meeting, mostly from industry.AP6 is a groundbreaking approach to addressing climate change that involves countries representing 50 per cent of the world's emissions, 50 per cent of the world's GDP and about 50 per cent of the world's population. It focuses on practical action. The point is that it brings together countries like the United States, China and India, and that is of course crucially important if this issue is to be seriously addressed.Are there any alternative views? We have heard from a Labour leader over the last two days a very realistic approach, I think, to the whole issue of climate change. Prime Minister Blair has said, 'The fact that we have a forum where people like Australia and the United States -  - There is appalling shouting, Mr Speaker. Manners, manners! Prime Minister Blair said, 'The fact that we have a forum where people like Australia and the United States sit down with China and India is a very positive change.' - He went on to say:... we need also to look to the future now ... There will be no agreement worth having that does not involve the United States, China and India ...I could not agree more with that. One of the numerous shouted interjections I have heard is, 'What about Kyoto?' Mr Blair said that Kyoto is not enough. He said, 'We need to cut greenhouse gas emissions radically -  - but Kyoto won't even stabilise them.' Of course, that is a point we have been making. We do need a dose of realism in this debate. The honourable member for Grayndler described the AP6 initiative as 'nothing but spin', and it has been continually criticised and opposed by the Labor Party. I can only say that AP6 is a fine initiative which is well supported around the world.</DOC>

 - There are a lot of questions in that question. Let me make the simple point - and by the way, I am not verifying the words that have been put in my mouth by counsel representing somebody who is representing someone in the Cole commission; indeed, the last thing I am going to do is get into an ongoing debate with people in the Cole commission about who said what, why, when and where and the exact words they used - that at no time did the government believe, including at that time and including later that year, that AWB Ltd had knowingly and wittingly paid bribes to Saddam Hussein's regime and that by paying the Jordanian trucking company, AWB Ltd had knowingly been doing so in order to pay bribes to Saddam Hussein's regime. They maintained the position that they had not been knowingly doing that right up until the beginning of the Cole commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and for his great advocacy on behalf of and his pride in the Townsville based troops serving in Iraq. Recently I had the privilege of visiting Australian Defence Force personnel who are serving in Iraq. There are 1,350 from the north Arabian Gulf through Iraq in various elements of our deployment and I have never been more proud to be an Australian than to see not only what our Australian Defence Force personnel are doing but why they are doing it. You would be forgiven, as an average Australian, for thinking that things in Iraq are not going well, that progress is not being made. Every single day, we turn on a television or we open a newspaper and we see evidence of the latest act of terrorism that has been conducted by some Saddamists, by jihadists or by insurgents - basically, terrorists and criminals. As we heard yesterday from the British Prime Minister, the intention of those people is to weaken our resolve.It is estimated that the Iraqi economy will grow this year by 16½ per cent. Also there are now 230,000 Iraqis who are trained in their own policing and security and indeed for their own army. There are 10 million Iraqis today who have access to sewerage services that were denied them under Saddam Hussein and 1.2 million who have access to clean water which they did not have before. There are 3,400 schools in Iraq today that are teaching Iraqi children because they have been refurbished over the last three years and another 700 are on the way.A recent poll of the Iraqi people found that 64 per cent believe that their country is moving in the right direction. The Iraqi people, unlike us Australians who often take these things for granted, risked their lives on three occasions to vote. Twelve million of them voted and in doing so made a very strong commitment to the democratic principles for which Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other coalition allies are fighting in Iraq.I am asked about alternative polices. The British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, said in this House only yesterday:If the going is tough, we tough it out. This is not a time to walk away. This is a time for the courage to see it through.The former chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition and commentator Mr Michael Costello put it in fairly Australian terms in the Australian on 13 January 2006 when he said:To disengage from Iraq now would be the biggest single encouragement the terrorists could get.If Australia or indeed any one of the coalition allies were to withdraw from Iraq now, it would give the terrorists the opportunity to claim a victory over not only Iraqi democracy but democracy throughout the Middle East and the rest of the world. It would give them the opportunity to claim victory over hopeful optimism, respect for human life and also all of the values this country has held dear in its short history.</DOC>

 - First of all, these alleged comments were in 2005. Secondly, I have made it perfectly clear on a number of occasions, including yesterday, that obviously I do not recall the exact words that were used in the conversation. I made that clear yesterday on a number of occasions and I make it clear again today. But I make the obvious point that AWB Ltd had made it clear to the government throughout, for example, 2005 in the context of the Volcker inquiry and right up until the end of last year that they had not in any way deliberately endeavoured to bribe Saddam Hussein's regime through phoney payments to a trucking company and that any payments that might have been made were made inadvertently and unintentionally. That is what they said. -  - Honourable members may laugh, and your laughter can well be directed to AWB Ltd if that is how you feel about it. According to the allegation of what I was supposed to have said at this meeting, I understand that the words that the member for Griffith chose not to use were that apparently I said to AWB Ltd, 'Tell us the truth.' Apparently I demanded they tell us the truth. - Did they tell us the truth? That is what the Cole inquiry is all about. -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand the member for Hinkler's interest in this issue because, thanks to the policies of the Howard government, the GP bulk-billing rate in Hinkler is up almost 10 per cent over the last 12 months. Bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, particularly to children and pensioners, and that is just what is happening thanks to the policies of the Howard government.Thanks to the bulk-billing incentive payments that were part of Strengthening Medicare, the GP bulk-billing rate has lifted from 66 per cent in December 2003 to over 75 per cent last December. Figures released in the last fortnight show that, between 2004 and 2005, the GP bulk-billing rate rose in 144 out of the 150 electorates of this country. In 96 per cent of electorates the bulk-billing rate rose last year. I was interested to note that in the electorate of Brand the bulk-billing rate has risen by almost eight per cent over the last year. The Leader of the Opposition is remarkably silent on this topic. - I hear 'Sound Effects Mark 2' over there talking about bulk-billing rates. Let me tell the member for Lalor: in her electorate last year the bulk-billing rate increased by more than 10 per cent to over 80 per cent. So while the member for Lalor has been appearing on Australian Story, making speeches undermining her leader and going on the front page of a magazine dressed in a $15,000 outfit - while she has been doing her Cheryl Kernot impersonations - we have been getting on with the job of delivering better health services to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. Of course, the member for Hughes knows that her current unemployment rate is just three per cent - an extraordinary outcome. Indeed, in Hughes there are some of the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years, significantly lower than when Labor held that seat, prior to 1996. In 1996 the Howard government inherited a moribund, tired Commonwealth Employment Service - the CES. The old CES was not doing anything for unemployed job seekers, nor for those who had vacancies and wanted to see them filled.A key priority of the new government was to put those unemployed into real jobs for their own sake and also for the sake of the country. In 1998, therefore, the coalition put in place a revolution in the form of a private sector driven Commonwealth employment service, and we called it the Job Network. How has this Job Network performed? Let me tell you: the latest figures show that Job Network has, since February last year and over the last 12 months up to February 2006, helped over 650,000 -  -  - The latest figures show that in the 12 months up to February 2006 the Job Network has helped over 650,000 Australians previously on welfare into real jobs - these are long-term jobs. This is an increase of over 50 per cent on the previous 12 months. As well, of those 650,000 new jobs, 43,000 were for those who were previously on the single supporting parent benefit. These are mostly women. This was a doubling of the figures of the previous year. The Job Network also placed over 11,000 people with a disability into work. That was a 64 per cent increase over the previous 12 months. Very significantly, 44,000 of these new-found jobs for people were for Indigenous Australians, who often face multiple barriers. That was double the number of those from the Indigenous community placed in employment in the year before.So this side of the House is not prepared to do what Labor did, which was simply to pump out short-term courses which led nowhere. Our figures show that we have an extraordinarily effective Job Network. But we are not going to rest on that capacity that we have developed in the last eight years. Through our welfare to work reforms, the Howard government are investing some $3.6 billion to help Australians, particularly those on income support, move into real jobs, into paid work. We recognise in particular people with a disability, people previously on single supporting parent benefits, mature age workers, Indigenous Australians and those who are long-term unemployed; people who may have, as I say, multiple barriers to work. They will be given particular assistance to find real jobs so they can join with the rest of Australia's workforce in sharing in the bounty of this country. This is very special help that we will deliver through Job Network. -  - Let me remind you again, since the opposition is so keen to know, that Labor presided over an 'unemployment policy' where they had at the peak some one million Australians out of work and an almost 11 per cent rate of unemployment. What extraordinary misery! What a disgrace! Let me give you one statistic that I think sums it all up. In the last six months the Australian government placed more people in work in long-term, real jobs than was achieved in the last six years of Labor. In the last six months we found more work for Australians than in the last six years of Labor. So the Howard government will continue to focus our employment policies on creating real jobs for all Australians, particularly for those who face multiple barriers.</DOC>

 - It's going well, PM. - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may be informed that the member for Hotham perhaps wanted to ask that question of him as well.Government members - Where the hell were you? - That is what he was asking. I thank my colleague for that question and acknowledge his question. Australia's 1.2 million small businesses have been looking forward to the day when we could deliver on the major challenges that they have wanted addressed. They have wanted, above all else, a good, strong economy in which to work and they have wanted a flexible workplace relations system. That is what this government has delivered in spades.I can tell you that small business today, though, are having a bit of a shock because they have now heard that the Leader of the Opposition perhaps has some other plans, and it is yet another version of roll-back. Small business have been right behind this government on every one of the 42 occasions that this government has attempted to get rid of the unfair dismissal laws, which the Leader of the Opposition now plans to reinstate. I can tell this House that, over the past 12 months, as I have gone around the country, small business have said to me at almost every single forum that I have held that what they have wanted to do was to get rid of that problem of 'go away' money. That is what this government has delivered. This government understands and appreciates the needs of small business. In the words of the Leader of the Opposition - he proclaimed it quite openly - 'The Labor Party is not for small business.' The latest alternative policy proves that.</DOC>

But the ordinary principles of commonsense tell me that in the second part of his question he lapsed into the rhetoric that has been so redolent of the Labor Party's approach to this matter.

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and recognise the enormous input that the electorate of Kalgoorlie has into Australia's national export effort. We have recorded in this place before the statistics for exports from Australia last year, which totalled $176 billion - a record in terms of the value of exports from Australia. Importantly, the economic rise of China, in transforming the global economy and through the impact it has been having on the regional economy in the last two years, has had a profound impact on that growth in Australian exports, with a lot of those coming out of the electorate of Kalgoorlie.In the last two years alone China accounted for a quarter of the world's total economic growth. It is a phenomenal growth to watch at the moment with the transformation and the industrialisation that is taking place in China, and of course Australia is a key partner in that. China has become our second-largest export market after Japan. Our exports to China rose in 2005 by a massive 41 per cent. Again, I include many of the exports out of the electorate of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, particularly minerals, fuels and energy, which recorded exports to China worth $8.3 billion. Agricultural exports have trebled in the last 10 years to $3 billion and China has become our third-largest agricultural export market destination.On the services side, there are now a record number of Chinese students studying in Australian educational institutions, with 81,000 Chinese students studying in Australia. Last year 285,000 visitors from China came to our shores as inbound tourists. Manufactured exports soared by 133 per cent from 2000 to reach a record level in 2005. And, of course, China has become the largest market for Australian wool - a commodity, Mr Speaker, that I know you take a great deal of interest in.Along with two-way investment flows the broad economic relationship between China and Australia is flourishing. Some of the agreements that have been put in place are quite significant, across the services and investment sector, not just the resources and energy sectors. With China throughout this decade we are building the foundations for Australia's economic future. We have to lock ourselves in as much as we can to the growth path that China is embarking upon, because inevitably it will benefit all Australians.Members would be aware that we have embarked upon the negotiation of a free trade agreement with China. We recognise that this will be a challenging agreement - it will not be like any other, but it is something that we must do to consolidate our position in this marketplace as well as create new opportunities for the future. It is all about our broader agenda as far as trade is concerned, its contribution to the Australian economy and the core objective of our government in keeping the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I can inform him that at the meeting of state and federal treasurers on Friday the GST proceeds -  
Opposition members - Feral treasurers? - I welcome the member for Hotham back again - the sound effects man. How we would have missed him if Senator Conroy, Mr Shorten and Mr Pakula - Mr Peculiar - had had their way and run him out of Hotham. It was not just Mr Peculiar, either: the Leader of the Opposition, the running dog of the roosters, if he had his way would have rubbed him out in Hotham as well. Anyway, I get distracted. Let me get back to GST. GST is distributed between the states in accordance -  -  - GST is distributed between the states in accordance with horizontal fiscal equalisation under an agreement between all of the states signed in 1999. In 2005-06 New South Wales will receive the sum of $10.2 billion of GST revenue. I might point out that when that was allocated at last year's conference not a word of objection was raised by New South Wales in relation to its entitlement. The then Treasurer, Mr Refshauge, did not object to that distribution. The formula of equalisation between the states administered by the Commonwealth Grants Commission has now been operating since 1933. The only reality about distribution between the states is that if one state gets more another state must get less. This is a zero sum gain. The $39 billion is distributed between the states. If one state gets more, another state must get less. The Commonwealth does not keep any of the revenues.As everybody in Australia knows, GST was introduced to abolish a whole raft of other taxes. Although each and every other state has now agreed to a timetable for the abolition of those other taxes, there is one state in Australia which refuses to name a timetable for the abolition of those other taxes. - There is one state of Australia which refuses to honour this agreement and which believes that it is entitled to keep in place the GST and the taxes which it was designed to replace. That is the shameful state of New South Wales. Premier Iemma wants to double tax the people of New South Wales. He wants them to pay GST and he wants them to pay stamp duty on their mortgages and stamp duty on their leases and stamp duty on their hire-purchase agreements and stamp duty on their unlisted marketable securities and stamp duty on commercial conveyances. The New South Wales Labor government has so mismanaged the state of New South Wales that it now wants to take GST revenue and keep the taxes that the GST was introduced to replace. Do we hear a word, a murmur, about this from anybody on the other side, any member of the opposition, including the member for Grayndler, who may have an interest in the New South Wales government and its tax policy? Not a word of complaint.Whilst I am on the subject, is there any political party at the federal level that supports the New South Wales government in its demand to take money off other states and give more to New South Wales? We have not heard the federal Labor Party say that either. In fact we had the situation before the last election where the Leader of the Opposition was promising more money to Western Australia, notwithstanding the fact that Western Australia is a recipient state under horizontal fiscal equalisation.I note that the federal Labor Party does not support the New South Wales government in its demand to take revenue off other states and to increase the New South Wales share of GST, but I also note that the federal Labor Party does support the New South Wales government in maintaining those taxes which the GST was introduced to replace. On this side of the House, having gone through the hard yards of tax reform, we demand that the people of New South Wales get their entitlements: that those taxes are abolished, that they are not double-taxed and that they are not put to a special penalty through an incompetent New South Wales Labor government.</DOC>

 - It would hardly come as a surprise to this House for me to acknowledge that my office does have regular contact with employer organisations. It is very regular and I make no apologies for that. I like to know the views of many people in the community, and we of course all know that the shadow minister has never had any contact with Greg Combet on this subject. So that must be our starting point on this issue.There is one thing I can say: I may have contact with employer organisations but I think I can confidently assert that no staff employed by any of my ministers has rung me on talkback radio with a dorothy dix question. We knew of 'Chris' - from Waramanga, wasn't he? We now have a modern version, which has come to us courtesy of Media Watch. 'I see a good amendment of life in thee.' Media Watch has given us Corinne, from HQ. It turns out that 'Corinne' is an employee of the member for Brisbane, who is a shadow minister. She apparently rang the Leader of the Opposition on ABC Radio 612 and said:Kim I'm just wanting to, as a young person I think this AWB thing's pretty scary and I just don't understand why it's not being highlighted as much. You know this is really scary-Australian dollars paying for weapons that we sent our troops off to fight in a war about.Kim Beazley said:Well you're taking a very good moral stand Corinne and I'm glad to hear what you've got to say.The interviewer said, 'But, Mr Beazley, this isn't biting out there.' Do you know how Mr Beazley replied? He said:The fact that Corinne's ringing me means that it is biting out there.'Corinne' happens to be the President of Queensland Young Labor. We are deeply indebted to the news hounds and sleuths of the Courier-Mail. They have a photograph of Peter Beattie after '10 years at the Labor helm'. You have Gough and Peter, and you have Corinne.I have to say that I looked at Corinne before I did Gough and Peter. I know I will get into trouble for saying that in this politically correct age, but I am too advanced in that view to change. The simple fact of the matter is that this is a shameful cook-up of a dorothy dixer, and I will not take any lectures from the opposition about whom I should talk to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question, which is an important one because, once again this morning and today, we have heard more hysterical and misleading claims from the ACTU and the Labor Party about Work Choices. In fact, on radio this morning, Mr Greg Combet, the Secretary to the ACTU, claimed that a Melbourne company - and this was repeated in question time by the opposition - had sacked workers because of their union activities. Mr Combet went on to say that the company had restructured itself such that it had fewer than 100 employees. If this is what Mr Combet believes, and if this is the evidence that Mr Combet has before him, he would know as the Secretary to the ACTU that it is unlawful to sack someone for being a member of a union. Indeed, it is unlawful to sack someone for engagement in trade union activities. Not only that, Mr Combet would know that there are penalties in the Work Choices legislation for companies that seek to restructure themselves in the way in which Mr Combet claimed this morning. This shows that, by making these claims on radio, Mr Combet is once again engaging in irresponsible fearmongering on behalf of the union movement.It is a bit like the member for Perth coming out and saying that four million Australian employees are at risk of being sacked. The reality is that Australians are sacked every day and have been since Federation. They were sacked last year; they will be in 20 years time. But also the reality is that, under the changes that this government has put in place, we have seen a substantial increase in employment in Australia - 30-year lows of unemployment, real wages increasing by 16.8 per cent - and these changes are about growing employment opportunities for real Australians.Indeed, this morning there was a report in the media from the Hudson recruiting group, which says that, according to a survey that it has carried out, 38 per cent of employers - that is almost four in 10 employers - are planning to increase their staffing levels in the months to June. But do we hear anything of this from the ACTU and the union movement? Nothing whatsoever. And, to give the lie to the campaign that the ACTU is running, on ABC radio this morning we heard from Zana Bytheway, the Executive Director of Job Watch, who was asked by the ABC presenter in Melbourne, Jon Faine, how many calls Job Watch had received regarding unfair dismissal over the past two days. The answer was half a dozen - half a dozen calls in two days. As Zana Bytheway said: 'There has been no change in the actual rate of calls.' And she said: 'I can't categorically say to you, 'Look, suddenly we've been inundated.'' So here is somebody who is the executive director of an agency, Job Watch, who receives this sort of call and says there has been no increase -  - It is always great to hear the member for Hotham in here. It is always great to see that he has survived. There has been no increase according to Job Watch in the number of calls. And what this does is to expose once again that this campaign by the ACTU and the Labor Party is pure hysteria. If you want to have a more realistic view of what the impact of these changes is, just take one from the Northern Daily Leader in Tamworth today, in the member for New England's electorate. We had a Mr Max Cathcart, the Manager of the Tamworth and District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said this about Work Choices:There will be many, many benefits to employees and employers over the next four to five years.That is what he said. A good employer will look after their employee because it is so hard to find good employees in rural areas. And we know that right around Australia. Mr Cathcart went on to say:The unfair dismissal law has been a deterrent to employing people.As Hudson said this morning, four in 10 businesses are looking to take on additional employees over the next three or four months to the end of June. This shows that, rather than the hysterical fear campaign we are getting from the Leader of the Opposition and the union movement, Work Choices provides Australian employers and businesses and their employees with the flexibility needed to get on and create more jobs. The Leader of the Opposition and his puppet-master, Mr Combet, ought to take a cold shower.</DOC>

 - I am not in a position to give any independent verification. The fact is that material has been presented to the Cole inquiry. The material to which the honourable member refers is clearly, as he would know, in the realm of hearsay. It will be for the commissioner, a very learned person, a very professional person, as acknowledged by the member for Griffith this morning, to make judgments. As I have said before, I say again: let us wait and allow the commissioner to sift through these matters and make his judgment. But, in answer to the question regarding the determination on my part for cooperation and transparency, that remains the case, and I do not believe anything has countermanded that.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. As suggested in his question, Condoleezza Rice, the United States Secretary of State, made what I think could only be described as a very successful three-day visit in the course of this month - her first visit here as the Secretary of State. She came with President Bush earlier as the National Security Adviser. During her visit here, Dr Rice was able to meet with me as her Australian counterpart, with the Prime Minister and with members of the National Security Committee of the cabinet. By the way, she also met with Mr Bob Hawke, the former Prime Minister, and had a discussion with him.During her visit we were able to talk about China, as was highly publicised at the time, and about Indonesia. We emphasised during those discussions the importance of a constructive United States relationship with Indonesia and that, particularly in the context of the American view - and quite correct, by the way - of the importance of democracy in human rights around the world, Indonesia is a shining example of a country which is Muslim and democratic. The success of Indonesia in recent times is an important part of the global argument for democracy and freedom.During the visit we also convened the first ever trilateral strategic dialogue with Condoleezza Rice, the Japanese foreign minister, Taro Aso, and me. This was a historic development in the relationship between our three countries. It was an opportunity to talk about counter-terrorism and about proliferation and non-proliferation issues. It was an opportunity to talk about some of the regional issues and questions about Iran, North Korea and, very importantly, Iraq and Afghanistan, because our countries all have an involvement in those issues. I think that the visit underlined not only the closeness of the relationship between the Australian government and the administration of the United States but also the tremendous value that this very close alliance has for Australia, for our engagement in the world and for enhancing the influence of Australia around the world.As to whether there are any alternative views, I remind the House of something I reminded the House of on a number of occasions - that a strong anti-American and anti-alliance sentiment runs through the Labor Party. The Australian National University's candidate study of candidates for the last election showed that only 40 per cent of Labor candidates thought that the alliance was very important to Australia's security, and 31 per cent had little or no trust in the United States coming to the defence of Australia.The former Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, made it clear that he saw no value in the alliance, and frontbenchers in the Labor Party pretended they did not know that was his view during the time he was Leader of the Opposition. Of course they knew it was his view. He was appealing to that very big component of the Australian Labor Party which is deeply opposed to the American alliance.</DOC>

 - Incorporated in one question were many questions. Let me say first of all that editorials in newspapers sometimes praise me and sometimes do not. But I think that as a government we can be enormously proud of what we have achieved in the area of foreign policy. I doubt that there has ever been a government in the history of this country which has done more in the area of foreign policy. -  - In response to that particular point, let me say that I am enormously proud of what this government has achieved in the area of foreign policy. I think that has been very much reflected in the views of the Australian people, despite the editorial in the newspaper - which I have to confess is normally a newspaper I quite like, but not so much today. But I cannot write the editorials myself. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they are not. I have been in politics for 21 years and you have to put up with this sort of thing if you are tough in politics.The second thing is that the opposition depends enormously heavily for its arguments here on drawing on handwritten notes from a second-hand account of a meeting. This is AWB Ltd's defence. If they had been knowingly involved in paying kickbacks, they would have been committing a criminal offence. If that is the case, they will most certainly be held responsible. There is no question about that. But the government has made the point - and I have made the point on many occasions myself - that our policy was always to support the United Nations sanctions regime, always to support the oil for food program. Nothing has been brought forward in the Cole commission - including through the evidence presented to the Cole commission by, I think, up to 11 present or former officers of my department - to contradict that.What is more, the suggestion that somehow my department and I, the Minister for Trade or anybody else were involved in a cover-up has never been established in any of the evidence in the Cole commission. The witnesses from my department have made the position of the government perfectly plain and perfectly clear. This is bodgie sexing up of a comment here or a comment there - in this particular case, second-hand comments. This is of course part of AWB Ltd's defence, which appears to be the source of argumentation for the opposition - now the AWB is the source of argumentation for the opposition! It just shows how spurious and weak the argument is - and the public know it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Ninety five per cent of all businesses in this country are small businesses and I can tell the House that their immediate reaction to the government's new laws has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me tell the House what the grassroots of small business are saying. Con and Marie de Groot, owners of the Healesville newsagency, said, 'We welcomed the introduction of the legislation some weeks ago and therefore employed an additional person on an AWA. We are appreciative of the flexibility, certainty and, consequently, the increased opportunity to offer local employment.'Another small business man, Sydney trailer maker Elvis Kiseloski, who employs five people, said that the reforms have allowed him to 'breathe a sigh of relief'. He said, 'These new laws make it enticing for us to put on someone else.'The opposition leader has been well aware of the restrictions to growth that have been impeding small business. In fact, in May of last year he said, 'Small business owners are telling me that they do not want to be held to ransom by rogue employees,' yet he has been prepared to do absolutely nothing - unlike this government, which has delivered for small business, enabling small business to grow and prosper.</DOC>

 - I am surprised that the member for Griffith has asked me this question, because the secretary of the commission wrote to him expressing a view on the matter. Nonetheless, I will take him through it and explain the position for the benefit of the parliament. The decision by the government to establish the Cole inquiry followed a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the wake of the Volcker committee inquiry, and I will quote the relevant extract from the spokesman for the Secretary-General. This is what he had to say:He notes that a vast network of kickbacks and surcharges has been exposed, involving companies registered in a wide range of member states, and certified by them as competent to conduct business under the Programme - that is, the oil for food program. He continued:He hopes that national authorities will take steps to prevent the recurrence of such practices in the future, and that they will take action, where appropriate, against companies falling within their jurisdiction.That is precisely the request that the government responded to - in other words, to take action against companies falling within their jurisdiction. There were three such companies named in the Volcker inquiry. There was the AWB and there were the other two, which have not received very much coverage, which is hardly surprising. We thought the correct thing to do was to establish an inquiry as to whether those companies had broken any law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory of Australia in relation to their conduct. It was precisely in response to the request of the Secretary-General that we established the inquiry. - If the member for Griffith will contain himself, I will come to the issue that he has raised. The commissioner has said a number of things. I refer the House back to the statement he issued on 3 February 2006, in which he said that the inquiry will address and make findings regarding at least the following: the role of DFAT; the knowledge of DFAT; what AWB told the Commonwealth and in particular DFAT; and whether the Commonwealth, and in particular DFAT, was informed of any knowledge AWB may be found to have had regarding payments by AWB to Alia. In other words, Mr Cole is making it very clear that he will make findings in relation to all of those matters.Importantly, he also said in paragraph 14 of that statement - and I ask the House to listen to this carefully because it goes to the core of what we established the committee to do:Accordingly, if, during the course of my inquiry, it appears to me that there might have been a breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law by the Commonwealth or any officer of the Commonwealth related to the subject matter of the terms of reference, I will approach the Attorney-General seeking a widening of the terms of reference to permit me to make such a finding.Mr Speaker, let me, I hope doing no injustice to the language of the commissioner, spell out a little further what that means. That means that, if he thought a minister had broken the law, he would ask for an extension of the terms of reference to investigate that. And it is entirely proper that he would do that. Interestingly and instructively, he then went on, in paragraph 15, to say:That position has not been reached. The position may change -  - Let me start again in relation to paragraph 15 and the need to request an extension of the terms of reference to examine whether there has been any illegal conduct, including by an officer of the Commonwealth, which means a minister, amongst other things. He then goes on to say:That position has not been reached. The position may change as inquiries continue and evidence is called. There is thus no basis upon which, at this time, it would be appropriate for me to suggest to the Attorney-General that the terms of reference be widened to enable me to make findings regarding whether the Commonwealth, or its officers, might have breached Commonwealth, State or Territory law.The situation, therefore - and in direct response to what the member for Griffith has asked me - is that the terms of reference are limited to whether any of the named companies broke a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory. The commissioner has further said that if he thinks somebody else has broken a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory he will ask the government for an extension of the terms of reference. I can say now that, if he were to do so, he would get that extension. We are doing exactly what Kofi Annan required us to do, and we will continue to do so. The House would be well served by allowing a highly professional, highly competent lawyer, Mr Terence Cole QC, to do his job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. I inform him and the House that the Howard government's Medicare safety net is the most important structural change to our great Medicare system since its introduction 22 years ago. Thanks to the safety net, in this calendar year almost one million people will benefit from higher Medicare payments, at a cost of over $200 million. But they will not benefit if the member for Lalor gets her way, because she hates the safety net and wants to scrap it. She repeated her criticisms of the safety net in her Fabian Society speech last week. It was mostly an unsubtle attack on the Leader of the Opposition, but she did also criticise the safety net. This prompted the former chief of staff to the opposition leader to declare that 'Lalor was worse than Latham' and that 'she was more sneaky but less suss than the former Leader of the Opposition'.The member for Lalor says that the safety net is unfair because benefits are skewed to coalition electorates. That is what she says. Actually, if you have higher costs, you get higher benefits in every electorate, regardless of who holds it. I did look at the highest safety net benefit payments in New South Wales. I looked at those on an electorate by electorate basis. I found that they were not in Wentworth, not in Bradfield, not, I regret to say, in Warringah; the highest safety net benefits per electorate in New South Wales were actually in the electorate of Grayndler. No wonder Lalor hates the safety net! I came across something else the other day:On current form, Albanese will support Beazley and do in his Left comrade, Gillard. Another sign of the madness of the Left.This appeared on page 391 of The Latham Diaries, the entry from 30 November 2004. He went on to say:I advised Julia to see if she could butter up Albo for the next six months -  - Mr Speaker, the member for Grayndler might not like the safety net, but I can tell you that his constituents do. His constituents certainly like the safety net. Aren't they such a bunch of happy campers over there? It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition said to his 'cursed caucus': 'We've got to be much nicer to each other in future.'</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member for Griffith that, in answering his earlier question, I explained what the terms of reference were and what matters they covered. I also explained that, if the commissioner believed that other people, including ministers, had broken the law, he would ask for an extension of the terms of reference and those terms of reference would be granted. I do not know how more complete my answer could be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and note his deep interest in schools in his electorate. The Howard government believes that it is the right of every parent to send a child to a school that best suits their individual needs, and that includes a choice of school in the government or the non-government sector. The Howard government also believes that parents, having paid their taxes, deserve some public support for their child's education, regardless of the school.The Australian government has now provided a record $33 billion in funding for all Australian schools over the 2005-08 period. This is a 59 per cent increase in funding for all schools over that of the previous four-year funding period. Members would be aware that non-government schools are funded by the Australian government according to the socioeconomic status formula, which means that students in the neediest communities receive 70 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a state school and students from the wealthiest communities receive some 13.7 per cent of the cost of funding a child at a state school. It is also worth remembering that 68 per cent of the total student population attends a state government school and that they receive 75 per cent of total public funding. Some 32 per cent of the student population attends a non-government school and receives 25 per cent of total government funding.I am asked about any alternative policies. Once again the Labor Party are in disarray. Members will recall the Latham schools hit list. Remember the former Leader of the Opposition's schools hit list that they took to the last election targeting the parents of the 1.1 million children who attend Catholic and independent schools? -  - Members would then recall that, after the last election, the member for Jagajaga thought that the schools hit list was such a vote winner that she confirmed that the Labor caucus had voted to retain this unfair schools policy. The Leader of the Opposition last year on Meet the Press confirmed Labor's unfair schools policy. He said it was a Labor position and always will be.Last week the member for Rankin popped up with an idea. It was his view that the difference between public and private schools should be abandoned by Labor, and he distanced himself from Labor's unfair schools policy. What did the Leader of the Opposition do? He quietly said, 'I like the direction Craig's thinking is going.' So what is Labor's position on the Latham schools hit list? What is Labor's schools policy? You have a backbench distancing itself from the policy, you have a shadow spokesperson still engaged in class warfare and envy, and you have a Leader of the Opposition who just does not know where he stands. The Howard government is committed to a fair and equitable schools policy.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank you for that ruling, but I am quite happy to address the issue of rorting. Might I say that I totally reject it. We have sought to establish whether there has been any illegal conduct - whether there has been a breach of a law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory - because that is what Kofi Annan asked us to do, and that is what we are doing. -  - The member for Denison SC knows quite well that the terms of reference enjoin the commissioner to make a finding in relation to three nominated companies. Yet again I will take the member for Griffith through what the commissioner has said. The member for Griffith wants the terms of reference extended to suit the political purposes of the Labor Party. It is already the case that if there has been any illegal behaviour by the companies the commissioner can make the findings. The commissioner has already said - and let me read it to the member for Griffith and everybody else again:... if, during the course of my inquiry, it appears to me that there might have been a breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law by the Commonwealth or any officer of the Commonwealth related to the subject matter of the terms of reference, I will approach the Attorney-General seeking a widening of the terms of reference to permit me to make such a finding.When he talks of an officer of the Commonwealth, he is talking of a minister, a secretary of a department or an employee of a department. What the commissioner himself has so plainly said is that if during his inquiries he finds material suggesting that people other than AWB and the other companies and their officers might have broken the law he will ask for an extension of the terms of reference. He made that statement on 3 February. It is now 29 March and after days and days of evidence and acres and acres of news coverage he still has not come across any such evidence. It is instructive that during the hearing earlier this week counsel assisting the Cole commission, Mr Agius SC, said - and I quote it directly:We have not been able to identify amongst the many thousands of documents we have from AWB, so we may have missed it, but I think it is unlikely, any document at all - any document at all - which indicates or records even that AWB or anybody on behalf of AWB mentioned Alia to any representative of the Commonwealth of Australia at any level at any time before the announcement of the Volcker inquiry.That is not the counsel for the Commonwealth, that is not the counsel for the Minister for Foreign Affairs; that is Mr Agius SC assisting the commission and making that statement after weeks of inquiry. I prefer the word of Mr Agius to the parlous and political words of the member for Griffith. We are the only government in the world to have established a public inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. We have embraced a level of transparency that has not been embraced by any other government around the world. We have done the right thing. We have not turned a blind eye to the Volcker inquiry. We have taken seriously the request of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We have appointed an eminent lawyer to do the job, a person respected, I gather - after his comment this morning - by the member for Griffith. We have been cooperative with the Cole inquiry. We will continue to be -  -  - The powers of the royal commission are adequate to investigate the illegality. If Cole thinks that -  - any of my ministers or I have broken the law he will ask for an extension of the terms of reference and he will get that extension. I have no intention of going down the path set out by the member for Griffith.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. As I said to the House yesterday, like many Australians, and many North Queenslanders in particular, including those that have been affected by the devastation of Cyclone Larry, he has been working tirelessly to make sure that people can return to their normal lives as quickly as possible. It is important to report to the House and to keep the Australian people updated - and the issue fresh in their minds - on just how challenging the circumstances are that continue to impose themselves upon people living in the cyclone affected areas. It is important to give credit to all Australians who have given significant financial support and support in kind.We also recognise that the corporate sector has provided considerable support to the people affected in North Queensland. Today I want to publicly thank the Australian Bankers Association and the banking organisations within North Queensland, as well as the insurance industry, which have acted, on the advice to me, with great speed and have offered great assistance to many people, particularly those in small business and those with housing loans, to help them through this difficult period. The banking industry has provided support by suspending loan repayments in certain circumstances, providing residential business and agricultural loan restructuring without the usual bank fees, refinancing at a discounted fixed interest rate and a waiving of early withdrawal fees for those customers wishing to access term deposits. It is important that the bankers continue to recognise the circumstances that face people affected by Cyclone Larry and I commend them today for their assistance.Earlier this morning I spoke with the Minister for Human Services, Joe Hockey. He is in North Queensland speaking with many families that are affected to see how the Australian government can continue to provide Centrelink services, support and delivery of the announcements that have already been made by the Prime Minister. I assured the Minister for Human Services, as he was speaking to some small business people when he called, that the Australian Taxation Office - as I reported yesterday - will continue to offer flexibility for those people, particularly farmers, who might have BASs to provide to the ATO. We do have continued flexibility in support of those people in this devastated region. I commend all of those people who have provided support to those in North Queensland. I can assure the people in that region that the Howard government will continue its considerable support to help them get back on their feet.</DOC>

 - The government's decision to establish the inquiry was in response to a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to, where appropriate, act against companies falling within their jurisdiction. What we have done is to establish an inquiry to determine whether there has been any illegal behaviour by the companies named in the Volcker inquiry. Plainly, the commissioner is investigating those matters and, plainly, the commissioner has said that, if he came across material that suggested that people, including ministers - I repeat: people, including ministers - had behaved illegally, he would ask for an extension of the terms of reference. The government regards that as an entirely appropriate situation. It is exactly what we were asked to do and it is what we ought to allow the commissioner to determine.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her interest in the families of her electorate and the important issue of child care. I can inform the House that, since the Howard government came to power in 1996, we have doubled the number of child-care places, raised spending to some $9.5 billion over the forward estimates and taken the number of outside school hours places from some 72,000 to 285,000. We announced in the last budget that we would continue to roll out further outside school hours places and, in addition to that, we have of course introduced the 30 per cent child-care rebate.I am asked by the member for Greenway what the alternative policies are. There are alternative policies that have been cobbled together in the last few days during the Commonwealth Games and announced by the Leader of the Opposition. After the rock show which was the member for Hotham's preselection, we had all the disturbances in the Labor Party - that is an understatement - so the Leader of the Opposition rolled out a child-care policy. When confronted by Alan Jones as to how this policy came about, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Well, actually, Alan, you threw a challenge out a few days ago and we took up the challenge.' So here is child care, this challenging issue which is fundamental to so many Australian families, and the Labor Party cobbles something together in two to three days. It sounds like the last election when, in response to 80,000 outside school hours places and a 30 per cent child-care rebate, the Labor Party's answer was, 'We'll give them 8,000' - fewer than 10 per cent of the places was their response. An element of the Labor Party policy was to establish child-care places in state schools.With regard to the 30 per cent rebate - which they are all bleating about over there - you would think it would not be Labor Party policy, but it turns out, for once, that they are now singing from the same hymn sheet. The member for Sydney has said, 'We don't want to abolish it.' That is because the parents need the money now. The opposition is agreeing, at last, with the 30 per cent rebate.There has been some other comment on the Labor Party policy. Child Care New South Wales put out a press release -  - Mr Albanese asks what Mrs Connolly had to say. - Mr Speaker, I will tell you what Mrs Connolly had to say. - She had this to say about you; she had this to say about the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition has read the press release from Child Care New South Wales and what the president had to say about him. Mrs Connolly said, 'Mr Beazley's proposals make me nervous.' I can tell Mrs Connolly that she is not the only one who is nervous about the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition. It is not only their child-care policy. The member for Hotham is awfully nervous, as are many on the back bench, about the rantings and ravings of the member for Brand and his total lack of understanding of the issue of child care and leadership of any political party in this country.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I think it would be a fairer interpretation of the letter written to his colleague - by not the commissioner, incidentally, but Mr Glenn Owbridge, the solicitor assisting the commission - to say that what the commission believes is that it would not be appropriate for a commissioner to seek amendment of the terms of reference to address a matter significantly different from that in the existing terms of reference.What the Leader of the Opposition wants is something that is significantly different and, quite frankly, the government is not going to accede to that request. The government set up an inquiry to determine whether there was any illegal behaviour. If that illegal behaviour has been engaged in by any of my colleagues or by me, if there is evidence of that, the terms of reference will be so amended. But we do not intend to go on frolics of the opposition in relation to this matter. The Leader of the Opposition might well expect that to be the government's position. I think the stance taken by Mr Owbridge in relation to the request from the shadow minister for foreign affairs is entirely appropriate and entirely predictable, and in advance I can let the Leader of the Opposition know that he will have to establish a case for suspending standing orders with his entirely predictable censure motion.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and also for his ongoing commitment to the interests of the people of Far North Queensland, along with, I might say, the member for Kennedy, the member for Lindsay and many others. Before I indicate to the House a number of changes that the government has announced and enhancements to the level of assistance, I would like to again place on record the gratitude of the government, and I know of the nation, to all of those people, including the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, the Queensland police and emergency services and the wonderful officers of Centrelink. The Minister for Human Services visited the area yesterday. The Centrelink people have done an absolutely superb job. I would not want any expressions of thanks not to include them.The government has decided - as I foreshadowed could well be the case when I made the original announcements in Innisfail last Wednesday week - on a number of enhancements which will meet need, and I believe they are very appropriate. In relation to the tax-free ex gratia payment to businesses, including farmers, the government has decided on two changes. The first is that we are going to remove the 20 full-time employee cap. In other words, these ex gratia payments will be available to businesses employing any number of employees, because there are a number of cases - albeit not a large number - where the 20 full-time employee equivalent cap worked to a disadvantage. We have also decided that if significant loss or damage above the normal can be demonstrated we will be willing, in those circumstances, to increase the payment from $10,000 to $25,000 to provide for additional assistance. But there will need to be a demonstration of that significant loss.I can also inform the House that in response to a number of representations, including from the honourable member, to increase the level of the concessional loan to businesses and farmers from the existing cap of $200,000, the Queensland Premier and I have agreed that under the natural disaster relief arrangements we will now provide concessional loans of up to $500,000 where a need can be demonstrated. The cap on the grant component of $50,000 will be retained and the moratorium on all repayments in the first two years will remain on loans of up to $500,000.I have also agreed with the Premier that under the natural disaster relief arrangements we will extend assistance to primary producers who have hired generators necessary to keep animal stock alive and healthy, such as dairy cattle which will die if not milked regularly, and aquaculture producers who need to maintain pumps and filters for the health of fish stocks. We will reimburse the costs of generator hire in those circumstances. This is in addition to reimbursement of excise on fuel used by businesses, farmers and households for power generators to produce electricity.The government has under continuing consideration some proposals in relation to employment subsidies. The request has been designed to prevent an exit of employees from the area. The Queensland Premier will be in Canberra on Monday in connection with the visit to Australia of the Premier of China. I hope to see him briefly on Monday afternoon to discuss other aspects of the disaster relief operations. I again record the fact that there has been total cooperation between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. I thank the Premier of Queensland for that and I thank the officers of his department and mine for the professional way in which they have worked together.I also mention, for the information of the House, that so far 2,700 claims have been made for the $1,000 for adults, $400 for children ex gratia assistance, 560 claims for the $10,000 ex gratia reestablishment of grant, 250 claims for the fuel excise grant and 170 claims for income support payments to businesses and farmers.Could I also, for the benefit of the House, acknowledge that Cyclone Glenda, which is off the coast of Western Australia, is being very closely monitored. It has reached the level of a category 4 cyclone. It is currently 200 to 300 kilometres from the coast and may make landfall tonight. WA agencies have begun evacuating coastal towns and I would encourage people living in the area likely to be affected to closely and speedily follow all removal and evacuation requests from authorities. Emergency Management Australia, under the control of the Attorney-General, is in regular contact with the Western Australian emergency management authority about the progress of Cyclone Glenda. It goes without saying that the government, in cooperation with the government of Western Australia, will provide all appropriate assistance, if needed, if the cyclone causes damage to life, limb or property.</DOC>

 - If that is the best quote you can come up with, it is not worth turning up on time for your contributions. This campaign, orchestrated by a weak Leader of the Opposition, demonstrates how completely out of touch the opposition is with the Australian people, Australian workers and, in particular, Australian small business. This government has an industrial relations plan which has dedicated itself to helping people into work, making sure that people continue to enjoy the real wages growth which has increased to almost 17 per cent under this government. It has meant there are 1.7 million more people in jobs than there were under a corrupt Labor government when they were in partnership with the ACTU and other union organisers - when they were in government for 13 long years. I do not make any apology for supporting a very sound industrial relations policy. If the Labor Party is interested in the workers of Australia, it will get behind this policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Of course, the member for Hinkler represents a part of Queensland that is totally focused on exports, and it is interesting to see the shift in the mix of exports out of the electorate of Hinkler, including manufactured exports. Yesterday we released the 2006 trade statement, which indicated that there had been a 15 per cent increase in 2005 to $176.7 billion of goods and services exported out of Australia. We all recall that, back in 1996, that figure was $99 billion. So, over that period, the figure has gone from $99 billion worth of exports of goods and services to $176.7 billion worth of exports of goods and services.As part of that effort last year, many of our major exports had a record year. Our beef exports had a record year in 2005. Our lamb exports, our iron ore exports, our coal exports and our education exports had a record year in 2005. Motor vehicles and manufactured products had a record year last year. Medicines manufactured in Australia had a record year in 2005. They all had a record year and they all contributed to a record year in overall exports of $176.7 billion.The member for Hinkler asked what the government's reforms have done in helping to strengthen the capacity of Australia's exporters. They have done a lot. I will mention two reforms we have undertaken over the last 10 years that were opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party. In our tax reform package, we removed $3 billion worth of taxes off the back of our Australian exports every year. We removed $3 billion of taxes that were a burden to Australian exports going overseas and made them more competitive.We all remember the second tranche of workplace relations reform: reform of the waterfront. Remember how hard fought that was in this country? The reform of the waterfront increased the crane rate on the waterfront from 17 TEUs an hour to 28 TEUs an hour. We were being told by the Labor Party and the union movement that you could not improve it beyond 17 lifts an hour, and now it is 28 lifts an hour. Many exporters say the one single thing this government has done that has benefited them is to improve the efficiency of the waterfront so that they can get their product through the waterfront when they need to.We have eliminated Labor's debt - the $96 billion debt that we inherited. We have helped keep interest rates low so that our exporters are more competitive. There have been 1.7 million jobs created in the Australian economy. Wages, over the last 10 years, have grown by 16.8 per cent.In November last year in answer I think to a question from the member for Hinkler, I used a quote from a manufacturing exporter, a company by the name of Austchilli, in Bundaberg in his electorate. They said then that workplace reform was the next step they needed to secure the position of their business in the international marketplace. It is interesting that the founder and owner of Austchilli, David de Paoli, said today that he now has 50 employees. Last year he had 35, so he has 15 extra from last year. He said:This new legislation gives me more flexibility with employee-employer relationships. That will allow us to increase productivity without the need for any redundancies.He went on to say:I have no intention of sacking anyone, and I do not think they have any intention of walking out, because we are on the same side, working together to compete against the rest of the world.That is a manufacturing employer in the member for Hinkler's electorate, and that is what he is doing today with the new workplace relations reforms. Despite the scare tactics that have been run by the Labor Party and the union movement, employers and employees are working with our government to keep the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

Having only been in this place just under five years, one thing that I have learned is never to take at face value the word of the Australian Labor Party. Let me provide this undertaking to the House: when I look into the matter and receive the full facts - not the Labor version of the facts - I will respond accordingly. Let me make a more general point. This government has provided more choice for people in this country. The choice they had under Labor was no job or a job; 1.7 million people are into jobs who never had jobs under the Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. When the government introduced the GST in 2000, it replaced wholesale sales tax, bed tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on marketable securities and a whole raft of other taxes which most of the states are continuing to abolish. We cut income taxes in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The latest OECD report released overnight showed that of the 30 OECD countries Australia has the eighth lowest overall tax burden.Interestingly, Australia compares very favourably on average wages with the developed world, including the United States. In US dollars, after tax and the application of what is called the tax wedge, Australian single, average workers have a net wage of $US28,000 - the seventh highest net wage of the 30 OECD countries and higher than the comparable US wage of $24,206. In other words, in US dollars after tax, average workers are better off in Australia than average workers in the United States. In fact, the average Australian worker takes home more pay. This also applies to single-income couples with two children. For Australia, the net income was $32,816 -  - compared to the US where a single income couple with two children earning the average wage took home $30,081. Again, on average wages for a single-income couple with a family, the Australian worker takes home more than the US worker does. In each of those cases Australia produced the sixth best outcome of the 30 countries of the OECD. This shows that Australia is up the top of the ladder for low taxes and particularly up the top of the ladder when it comes to wage earners who are on average earnings or single-income wage earners.I heard members of the opposition interjecting. We might be interested to hear from their interjections what their tax policy might be. Even if they take no interest in what their spokesmen says, I do. The Labor Party has now called for a tax cut for hybrid cars, a tax cut for child care, a tax cut for low-income workers, a tax cut for developers of gas fields, a cut in company tax, a tax cut for middle-income earners and a tax cut for high-income earners. There you have it: everybody out there is entitled to a tax cut, according to the Australian Labor Party.You might ask yourself: how is this all to be paid for? That question was put to the member for Lilley by Charles Wooley this morning. The member for Lilley was fuming with Mr Wooley about what had to be done and Mr Wooley said to him, 'What should the top rate be? Let's quickly work out what the top rate of the ideal tax system would be.' Not a bad question. Listen to this: 'Charles, I'm not going to nominate a rate on this program.' Wooley: 'Come on!' Swan: 'Then I'll have Peter Costello in the parliament who'll cost it.' Oh, silly old me! Fancy keeping the Labor Party honest. Fancy actually asking them to pay for a promise. Oh where will I end the nasty tricks that I keep getting up to, actually looking behind these promises to see what they are going to cost and whether or not they are affordable?This is what you learn in Labor Party training school when you go to the seminar. Seminar 1 on a Monday morning is how to stack a branch. Seminar 2 on Monday morning is how to deliver money to Democrats in brown paper envelopes. Seminar 3 on a Monday morning is how to say a family payment of $600 is not real money. If you say it over and over again, you can generally get somebody to believe it. This member for Lilley is the person who distinguished himself at the last election by claiming that $600 paid to every Australian family did not exist. So we have every right to ask him to nominate his rates and I can promise him this: we will be costing his policy and it will cost him very dearly.</DOC>

 - I have been savaged in here before, but never like that. This is a government which has delivered a tax system which has cut capital gains tax in half, which has cut the company tax from 36 to 30 per cent, which has abolished the bed tax, the bank account debits tax, the financial institutions duty, stamp duty on marketable securities and stamp duty on unmarketable securities. This government cut income tax in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005, has legislated an income tax cut in 2006, has a tax to GDP ratio which is the eighth lowest in the developed world and has a spending to GDP ratio which is the second lowest in the developed world. So in relation to the Australian taxation system we have made great strides. To the average Australian, the top income tax rate that they will face is 30 per cent up to $80,000 and the people who will be subject to the top rate of tax in Australia will be the three per cent of high-income earners.That record, as measured by the OECD, is one of the strongest in the OECD. Does that mean that everything in Australia is perfect? Of course not. We are only the eighth best in the OECD. We should aim to be higher than the eighth best in the OECD. We should aim to maintain our position and, if we could, to improve our position; but I can tell you one thing. All of those changes were opposed by a certain political party. We would not have got there if that party had been successful. We also have the memory of the last time the Labor Party promised a tax cut. Did I say 'promised'? No, it was l-a-w. It just never came about, not for one day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question, because we have been hearing these false and hysterical claims from those opposite and from the union movement about how Work Choices is cutting wages for Australian workers. So I was very interested to read a report this morning in the West Australian newspaper which says that the John Holland construction group will be offering employment contracts to 180 individual workers on a building site in Port Hedland using a new provision in the work choices legislation. Indeed, John Holland's Port Hedland agreement delivers pay rates which, according to the report, are among the highest in the booming north-west 'with unskilled labourers to collect $2,700, including allowances, for a 60-hour week'. That is, $2,700 for unskilled labourers under this agreement. That would not have been possible prior to Monday, because it is as a result of the work choices legislation. Indeed, in another report about this, a spokesman for John Holland in the Australian Financial Review is quoting as saying:It's quite intentionally not trying to undermine -  - It is interesting how they do not want to hear the good news. Mr Sasse, a spokesman for John Holland, said:It's quite intentionally not trying to undermine existing market conditions and you'd be a bloody fool to try and do it because no one would come and work for you.That is reflecting, of course, on the contraction in the growth of the workforce because of the ageing of the population. Here is an example of a big business operator in Australia - one of the major construction companies in Australia - taking on more workers under a new provision in the work choices legislation and paying them as unskilled labourers some $2,700 a week. The advantage of Work Choices is not just for major employees. - We heard on the Channel 10 News on Monday evening from the store manager of Sumo Salad, a small business, who said:We can provide a lot of productivity and performance based incentives. We can convert part-time people into more permanent positions so we can improve our service. Our staff are a lot happier. We guarantee some work on the roster. We guarantee some weekend work.Here you have two examples of businesses, in one case large business and in the other case small business, saying, 'We can take on more workers and we can pay them adequately' - in fact, in the case of John Holland, up to $2,700. - The Leader of the Opposition is interjecting. This was a party that once pretended to represent the working people of Australia. The reality is they have abandoned that. I am always reminded of that famous statement by the father of the Leader of the Opposition, who said that, when he came into politics, the Labor Party represented the cream of the working class in Australia and, when he left it, it represented the dregs of the middle class. That is what he said - the father of Leader of the Opposition. I wonder whom he had in mind. The reality is that Work Choices, in just these two examples, is delivering real benefits to real Australian workers - the people that the Labor Party once pretended it represented.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for asking that question. This Sunday, Australians and Indonesians will participate in a commemorative service to mark the first anniversary of the tragic accident that took the lives of nine Australian service personnel on 2 April last year on the island of Nias. Those young Australians were helping Indonesians in Indonesia's time of very great need following the earthquake that struck Nias, which came soon after the devastating Boxing Day tsunami.Eight families from Australia - or 28 people in all - will travel to Indonesia over the next few days to participate in the ceremony. The government will be represented by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence and also by the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Bill Farmer. The Australian Defence Force will be represented by the Chief of Navy, Admiral Shalders, the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Shepherd, and the Maritime Commander, Rear Admiral Thomas.When people lose their lives in such circumstances we are reminded only too sharply of the dangers that people in the field responding to tragedy and to emergencies are exposed to every day. Yet, without their contributions, the lives of so many others would be lost or would be compromised.Like all neighbours, Australia and Indonesia deal with many challenging issues together. They are not always easy, but we are committed to working together on many fronts: confronting the threat of international terrorism and religious extremism, combating transnational crime, stopping illegal fishing and so on. But this commemoration on Nias on Sunday is a reminder of the importance of our bilateral relationship. It also reminds us that there are some issues in life which are beyond politics.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that, after he repeated the question from Kerry O'Brien, the Leader of the Opposition did not provide my answer. Instead he provided some kind of mock executive council minute. I know he still lives back in those days when he was the Deputy Prime Minister - those great and glorious days! - and we were reminded of those -  JOHN HOWARD: But Kerry, the answer is yes I do -  - As I indicated in that interview with Mr O'Brien last night, the reason the government does not intend to change the terms of reference as requested by the Labor Party is that the royal commissioner already has all the authority to make adverse findings in relation to ministers. He has already given an indication that, if, at some stage during his investigation, he comes across something indicating that a minister or anybody else in the government has behaved illegally, he will seek an extension of his terms of reference. I have already indicated in those circumstances that extension would be granted. He has also indicated that he has adequate power to make findings of fact in relation to the knowledge and behaviour of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's officers. Any commonsense understanding of the English language will tell you that that is all the power to make findings of fact and, if necessary, after extension of terms of reference, findings of illegality in relation to any officer of the Commonwealth - and that, of course, includes a minister.I would say again that what the Leader of the Opposition ought to do is allow the commissioner to do his job. While I am on my feet, I might draw his attention to an article on page 2 of the Australian this morning which quoted a person who I think had been the head of Canadian intelligence and had been a senior officer in the Volcker oil for food inquiry. It is very interesting that, at the conclusion of that article, he contrasted the reaction of the Australian government to these allegations - the reaction of the government I am proud to lead - with the reaction of 24 other governments whose companies had been named. In the case of the 24, he indicated that all of the inquiries were restricted to in-house police inquiries where, by contrast, the Australian government had engaged in an open, transparent public hearing. That is a measure of this government's openness on this issue. We are the only government in the Western world to have had an open royal commission into these matters. This government deserves praise for having established this inquiry. This government, unlike other governments, has not been afraid to get to the bottom of this matter. We will, and we all await with great interest the findings of Mr Cole.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. This government does not just talk about Medicare; we spend the money necessary to make a good system even better. Since 1996 health spending has risen from 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the federal budget. Since 1996 federal health spending has risen from 3.7 to 4.3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. It is not the quantity of the spend but the quality of the outcome that counts. And, since 1996, we have 30 per cent more medical students and 30 per cent more GPs in training. Bulk-billing rates for children are at an all-time high, bulk-billing rates in the country are at an all-time high and bulk-billing rates for people over 65 are at near-record levels.I have been asked about alternative policies. Just after he was restored to the leadership, the Leader of the Opposition said Medicare Gold 'disappeared with Mark'. That is what he told the Sunday Telegraph on 30 January last year. It certainly has not disappeared from Labor's website. I looked on Labor's website today and I found something called 'Labor's principles' and the only health policy is Medicare Gold. So who is in charge - the member for Lalor or the member for Brand? It seems that he can stop the member for Lalor asking questions in parliament, but he cannot get her policy off his website. He took 14 minutes to get Latham's T-shirt off the website, but in 14 months he has not been able to get Gillard's policy off the website. We know what the member for Brand thinks of these policies. They are lightweight and banal -  - We know that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that the member for Lalor's policies are lightweight and banal, because Michael Costello published that in the paper last week. But the member for Lalor has one thing right: in her notorious Sydney Institute speech the other week, she said, 'If you can't run a political party, you certainly can't run this country.' I call on the Leader of the Opposition to clarify just who is really in charge of Labor's health policy.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. He has always had a great interest in foreign affairs, as I think all members of the House know, and a very sincere interest. The latest development is that the Premier of China, Premier Wen, will be in Australia next week. He is visiting Australia from 1 to 4 April. This is the first visit by a Chinese Premier to Australia - although of course we had a visit by the President - since 1988. It follows the visit of the President in October 2003. Premier Wen will naturally meet with the Prime Minister and with other members of the cabinet, business leaders and also with representatives of the Chinese community in Australia. I think this visit is likely to help enhance our relationship with China. We have very highly complementary economies. China is now Australia's second largest trading partner. Our exports to China grew last year - as the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister knows only too well - by 30.6 per cent and our people to people links are very strong.Interestingly enough, there are now 70,000 Chinese students studying in Australia in one form or another. We share a lot of interest in the region through APEC, through the ASEAN Regional Forum and nowadays through the East Asia Summit. As China's economy grows, then naturally as a country it will become increasingly important. We see it as significant that China's growing economic weight is accommodated in the region. We also believe that China has to understand that, if it becomes more powerful and more influential in the region, that can arouse sensitivities and so it has to make a very constructive contribution to the affairs of the region. An illustration of that is the way China has played such a useful role in helping to promote the six-party talks with North Korea.There is no doubt that a good constructive relationship with China is good for Australia, and I think that sentiment is very much reciprocated. But that is not to detract from the fact that we do have some differences with China and we should be able to talk about those differences. We obviously have very different political systems. This is a robust, liberal parliamentary democracy - China is certainly not that. We are concerned about copyright issues, about copyright protection, and we would like to see China do more in that particular area. The protection of intellectual property is quite a big issue on the trade agenda with China. Finally, we obviously have some human rights concerns with China. This government established in the late 1980s a bilateral human rights dialogue with China. I think we were either the first or the second country ever to do so. Through that, and on other ad hoc occasions, we do raise human rights issues of one kind or another with China.But overall we very warmly welcome the visit by Premier Wen. It will be an opportunity to consolidate and strengthen our dynamic and mutually beneficial relationship. I think we have illustrated the point over the last few weeks that our relationship with the United States, through Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit, and our relationship with the United Kingdom, through Tony Blair's visit - very traditional relationships for Australia - have never been stronger. But, at the same time, we have Premier Wen from China coming and we are able to build a strong relationship with that very different country in our broadly defined region. I think it is a good thing that we are able to do both - consolidate our relationships with our traditional friends and allies as well as build new linkages and relationships in Asia.</DOC>

 - We obviously provided full cooperation with the Volcker inquiry and I think, as the Prime Minister already said in answer to an earlier question today, that has been attested to by one of the people who worked for the Volcker inquiry. I seem to recall that when I visited Mr Volcker at the end of last year that was confirmed as well. As far as the Cole inquiry is concerned, we have obviously fully cooperated with him. Let me make this point: the Volcker committee was impressed with the cooperation of the Australian inquiry and, as a result of the Volcker inquiry -  - I have no knowledge whatsoever of us withholding documents from the Cole inquiry that we provided to the Volcker inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and his very strong commitment to the Air Force presence at the Richmond base in his electorate. The first and most important priority of this government is the defence and security of Australians, Australia and its interests. Consistent with that, I announced on behalf of the government earlier this month that the government will purchase at least three and probably four C17 Globemasters, built by Boeing, through the United States Air Force. These are very big planes. They are about the size of a 747. They carry almost four times as much as a C130 Hercules, a plane which is very well known and familiar to everyday Australians.It is important that we appreciate that, as the government builds the strength of Australia's Defence Force, we have the capacity to move our people and our equipment not only into other parts of the world but to parts of Australia when we need them and where we need them - for example, the C17s, the first of which we expect to arrive in Australia before Christmas this year. If there is a cyclone in the western part of Australia which wreaks the kind of devastation that unfortunately we have seen with Cyclone Larry, one C17 can move from RAAF Richmond in Sydney to the west coast of this country in five hours - it would take four C130s 12 hours to do.We are also determined that, as we face the future, Australia will continue to increase its investment in defence, and that requires two things. It requires political will and a government that is strongly committed to investment in defence and its people. The second thing it requires is money. This expenditure is around $2 billion of additional money, which Australia can afford to spend in addition to the $28½ billion the government announced in increased investment in defence in 2000. The reason the government can afford to do this is that this country has been extremely well led and managed economically over the last 10 years. This is about Australia's future and we are determined to see that Australia is independent, that we will not have to rely on leasing ageing Antonov for heavy lift nor wait in queues for American airlift. Australia is and will increasingly become an independent country in every sense of the word.</DOC>

 - We have exhausted all questions on Iraq and now we are into the gutter. This was a long time ago, but as far as I recall - and the Attorney-General will correct my memory - there was an Australian Federal Police investigation into this leak and they produced a report. I think that report saw the end of the matter.</DOC>

 - The obvious first answer to the honourable member's question is that this government has put on the table $12.7 billion, under the AusLink program, to fund some of the major road and rail infrastructure projects that are essential to keeping our transport system working well. It is absolutely vital that we improve our infrastructure, given the prospect of Australia's transport task doubling within 20 years. It will require a continuing commitment to ensure that the transport sector can play its role in a strong and vibrant economy.Over the last couple of weeks, governments around Australia have responded to the National Transport Commission's assessment of the costs of road transport and the implications for the provision of infrastructure. The NTC had recommended a 2.1c a litre increase in the fuel excise, effectively paid by the road transport industry, and increases in registrations on large trucks to around 30 per cent. I know that the prospect of these increases in costs was a matter of grave concern to members of the Australian government, and I am pleased to report to the House that the Australian government has voted no to these proposed increases. I am pleased to note also that, having publicly professed support for these proposals, the states eventually rolled over and voted no to those proposals.That does not mean that the government is opposed to cost recovery from the transport sector; we publicly support that objective, and so does the road transport industry. - The Australian transport industry itself supports -  - The Australian Transport Industry Association supports cost recovery from the transport industry. The problem with these proposals was that they would have led to substantial over-cost recovery. No-one could justify that level of over-cost recovery, which comes from the fact that registration fees on small trucks - which are set by the states - are too high. Every year, the states increase registration fees whereas, over the last five years, the federal government has frozen excise. We have done our part to keep transport costs low, and it is time that the states also played a role.That does not mean that we are anti-rail. Indeed, the country has been waiting for a very long period of time for the $2 billion that the government has put into rail infrastructure. Rail will play a vital role in our future transport tasks, and the government will support both rail and road to achieve maximum levels of efficiency. Instead of driving empty buses, it is time that the opposition started to drive some policy reform and support these key initiatives to get our country's transport system working efficiently and well.</DOC>

 - In answer to the first part of the question, the answer is no, I will not confirm that, because the assertions made by the Leader of the Opposition are wrong; therefore the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition has reached is fatally flawed, as is the whole of the argument that he has advanced on this matter.If the Leader of the Opposition bothers to listen, I will patiently and quietly take him through the sequence of how this works. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to know, again, how this works, let me tell him. Be he reminded that we had a request from the United Nations and, alone of sovereign governments around the world, the government have established a fully transparent inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter. Not only has the inquiry been invited to find out whether AWB committed any crime; by its own declaration the inquiry has also been empowered to make findings of fact on the conduct of ministers and government officials.From reading Mr Cole's statement of 3 February, it is quite plain that, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs has not done his job in relation to this matter, Mr Cole will so find that. It is quite obvious that he will so find it in relation to the Minister for Trade. It is obvious he will find it in relation to me because, if you read the statement he made on 3 February, he said that he would be able to make findings of fact about the knowledge of ministers in respect of the behaviour of AWB and whether those ministers or their departments came into possession of matters that were relevant to the payment of kickbacks or bribes by AWB.The statement I made last night was, I think, quite deliberately misquoted by the Leader of the Opposition. What I said last night - and I repeat it here today - was that, if I had been told by AWB that it was paying bribes to Saddam Hussein and I did nothing about it, it would be game over. Of course it would. But, interestingly enough, there is no evidence that that happened. Of course I was not told by AWB. Of course the minister was not. None of the ministers were. The reality is that the opposition are flailing around on this issue. - They have not been able to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by any of my ministers. They have not been able to produce evidence of any wrongdoing by any officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. All the member for Griffith has done is to sneer at and denigrate the hardworking people of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.We alone of governments established a transparent inquiry. It is presided over by an eminent lawyer, somebody who is well regarded in the Australian community. I believe, as most Australians do, that what should happen is that Mr Cole should be allowed to get on with his job and get to the bottom of this matter. The government await that conclusion. The government will continue to cooperate with the inquiry. At the end of the day, this government will be able to look anybody in the eye and say, 'We alone had the courage and the transparency to establish an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission.' I believe the government have acted with entire and complete propriety in this whole matter.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Gilmore for her question. I should also acknowledge the member for Wakefield and, in fact, so many colleagues on both sides of the House who have shown a particular interest in this matter. The government is very committed to recognising with the Australian Defence Medal the service of about one million post World War II current and former ADF personnel. This medal is about recognising that those people have served this country and have fulfilled their military obligations to Australia. So the ADM is an award for service given to a grateful nation.Her Majesty the Queen has now approved the official regulations and design of the award to acknowledge current and former ADF service men and women, regular and reserve personnel, volunteers and national servicemen - and I should acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of national service organisations representatives. These people who have served since World War II will be eligible to apply for this medal.After extensive consultation with veterans organisations, the broader community, the service chiefs and in fact a number of people in this parliament, the eligibility criteria have been extended to include all post World War II ADF members who completed an initial enlistment period or four years of service, whichever is the lesser. Expanding on these criteria, we will accommodate those who lost their lives in service, who were medically discharged as a result of a permanent, compensable injury or those who were unable to reach their four years or initial commitment period as a result of workplace policies, such as the policy of some earlier times where female members were asked to leave if they married or became pregnant. These criteria recognise that those people have done what they undertook to do.The medal has been created through an extensive process. This is a sample of the medal. You will see that it is a handsome, attractive and very dignified medal. It has inscribed on the back the words 'For service' to recognise that this is about acknowledging and saying thankyou to those people who fulfilled their undertakings to our nation since World War II. There is a circulation of information packs to all members of parliament; to ESOs, or ex-service organisations; and on the website as well. I hope all members in this House will encourage the deserving members of the ADF, present and past, to apply for this medal. We hope to have the medals available for presentation by mid-2006. They are in production. I commend this initiative to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, I am sure, the opposition spokesman for defence in passing to the Kovco family my condolences for what they have endured since the death in tragic circumstances of Private Jake Kovco.It is interesting that the average Australian would probably have thought until recently that Australia's defence personnel, were they to lose their lives in deployment, would automatically be returned to Australia and repatriated by the Australian Defence Force. However, it is interesting and instructive and the House should be aware that up until 1966 it was in fact the policy of the Australian government that war dead, whatever the circumstances, would remain in the country in which they had died and be buried at the nearest war graves cemetery. Between the end of the Vietnam War and 1997, the policy which existed in the defence services was that each service would look after its own deceased defence personnel.It was not until the eighties and the nineties that the policy became a combination, depending on circumstances, of the use of a civil contractor or indeed the use of the Australian Defence Force aircraft, in the main. In fact, in 1996, the policy which existed when this government was elected, in the Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare, Part One: The Conduct of Operations, which was dated 16 December 1996 and which is now obsolete, said: 'Where possible, the back loading of remains to the Australian support area will be achieved under civilian contract arrangements, but it may be necessary for support groups to provide transport and establish temporary storage facilities.'In the early hours of the morning following us discovering this appalling, terrible error, where the incorrect body had been dispatched from Kuwait to Australia, I said that these arrangements will change. I have instructed the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force to immediately ensure that the existing arrangements for the repatriation of any deceased Australian Defence Force personnel deployed are as stringently adhered to as is possible and that, wherever possible and/or practicable, we repatriate our deceased Defence Force personnel using Australian military aircraft and defence people.In the meantime, as I also announced in the early hours of that morning, I have also asked that all of the options be made available for the government to consider at a whole-of-government level the full repatriation, directly under Australian control, using Australian Defence Force equipment, if that is possible, of our own deceased Defence Force personnel. As soon as those options are presented to me, they will be presented to the government for their full consideration.The most important thing - which I have said to the Kovco family and which I say to the parliament and the Australian people - is that we must do everything we can that is humanly possible, whatever the economic commitment we are required to make, to see that this kind of error does not ever happen again.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. I know, bearing in mind that he is the member for the Darwin area, he has a particular interest in East Timor and has always been solicitous about their concerns.The government make no secret of the fact that we were deeply concerned by the outbreaks of violence in Dili from 28 April, and the government have been monitoring developments there closely. The situation as of today is calm but there are still underlying tensions in the country. Some groups are seeking to exploit those tensions and there is still the potential for there to be further violence; there is no question of that.On 5 May the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reissued a travel advice advising Australians to reconsider travel to East Timor at this time, because of the tension and the potential for politically motivated violence. It also advises that Australians in East Timor who are concerned about their safety should consider departing. But, let me also add, at this stage there is no indication that foreigners have been targeted by those who are perpetrating the violence.We have in a number of ways strongly urged the leaders of East Timor to resolve quickly and peacefully the differences that there are and, of course, to do so with full regard for the democratic institutions of the country, its constitution, the rule of law and international norms of human rights. I have spoken on several occasions to the East Timorese foreign minister, Jose Ramos-Horta. I spoke to him during the course of this morning yet again and registered these messages, and I had a substantial briefing from him about the situation on the ground. We are also, of course, staying in close touch with our ambassador in Dili, and she herself met with Prime Minister Alkatiri today.Last Friday, Australia agreed with the rest of the international community to endorse a renewed United Nations Security Council mission in East Timor. It will determine the nature of our contribution, once the shape of any new mission by the United Nations has been decided, but some time will be needed first of all to assess precisely what might be required. As the Prime Minister said last week, we hope that the government of East Timor can resolve this matter quickly and by using its own resources, but Australia does stand ready to offer assistance if requested by either the East Timor government directly or the United Nations. That is a point I reiterated today to Mr Ramos-Horta.Australia has played a very important role, as all members of the House know, in making the new East Timor possible. We have given a great deal of assistance to East Timor and we continue to do so. We watch events there with concern and with a good deal of diligence because we want to ensure as best we can that East Timor remains a stable country and is able to achieve economic growth in the interests of the welfare of its people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. As is often the case, the media reporting of this particular matter is not entirely as the facts would support. The Australian National Audit Office and the Auditor-General have put five recommendations, all of which have been agreed to by the Department of Defence. They are that: for future complex projects, the formal report of the Tender Evaluation Board's deliberations should be published; there should be periodic audits of intellectual property holdings; there should be testing before the acceptance of aircraft; liaison between project managers and capability managers should occur before accepting; and before the final contract is signed there should be unambiguous specifications. In fact, that is precisely the outcome of the reforms of Defence procurement undertaken under the guidance of Mr Kinnaird just over two years ago.When the Australian government signed this contract for these attack reconnaissance helicopters in 2001, the French program upon which it is based was 18 months ahead of that of the Australian government. The Australian government's performance in relation to the Tiger helicopters is so good that it is now ahead of that of the French and it is providing data back to the French. In fact, the project is on schedule; the aircraft are flying. This is a $1.9 billion acquisition by the Australian government. The Hellfire missiles have been successfully tested and, as far as the government is concerned, this project, particularly in relation to the training and the simulator, is very much coming back into program.It should also be accepted, and I think everyone should accept, that, in relation to significant acquisitions in terms of procurement, such as the Air 87 Project with the Tiger helicopters - of which we are purchasing 22, 18 of which will be built in Australia - none of this can be done without risk. This project is essentially on track and is a part of this government's significant commitment to strengthening Australia and building Australia's defence capability.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He represents an electorate on the coast of Queensland and would recognise the significant importance of the close relationship between Australia and Japan, given that the services sector is our largest export earner and that inbound tourism from Japan is a very important component of the earnings in the electorate of Hinkler.Japan is the largest economy in Asia and our largest trading partner, and in 2005 that trading relationship was worth a record $50.7 billion. It is the most significant trading relationship we have. Exports to Japan alone rose by 24 per cent in 2005, to stand at $31.5 billion. Some of the more important sectors in that export effort were minerals and fuels, for example, which set a record in 2005 of $15.6 billion. A lot of those exports were obviously from Western Australia, but they are very important in the overall structure of our economic relationship with Japan.In recent years the beef industry has been the single largest recipient of benefit from our relationship with Japan. Last Friday I was in Rockhampton for the Beef Australia Expo 2006 - I am sure the member for Capricornia, if she is here, also supported the expo - and had the opportunity to talk with many beef producers and processors there about what has happened in the global beef market. We are reaching for an export figure of $5 billion in toto for the beef industry. I am sure that when the member for Hotham was there he was apprised of how well the beef industry is going in exports. - Yes, he should be the shadow agriculture minister. Beef exports to Japan stood at $2.4 billion in 2005. In value terms, almost half of the beef that we export goes to Japan. Those industry leaders who were in Rockhampton last week made mention of this to my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. They want the government to maintain its agenda and ensure that we keep these markets open and that these industries remain competitive on the world stage.Japan is also our largest market for liquefied natural gas. LNG exports to Japan are now worth a record $3.8 billion. LNG is a huge opportunity for export growth in the future for Australia, and Japan will be one of our key markets for those exports. LNG export volumes are set to double to around 20 million tonnes per annum by 2011. Members would be aware that in coming weeks the first shipment of LNG in the $25 billion contract with China will leave the North West Shelf to travel to China, adding to the exports of this valuable resource that we are already achieving to Japan and Korea. By 2020 Australia will be one of the world's largest LNG producers and exporters, with exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars.The government is not prepared to take the relationship with Japan for granted. We are not prepared to just pocket it and expect that it will always be there. We need to continue to nourish and develop it to try to make it grow. That is why, after the Prime Minister's visit to Japan last year, we launched a feasibility study into a free trade agreement with Japan. We have now agreed with Japan to expedite the completion of that feasibility study so that it will be concluded this year. That will give us an opportunity to launch FTA  negotiations with Japan, our largest trading partner, by the end of this year or early next year. It is important that we do not rest on our laurels and that we do not put all our eggs into one basket in this policy area. It is important that we focus on developing new markets and on strengthening the existing markets we have had for many decades.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. It has been 266 days since the Australian Labor Party asked a question of me in this place about training, about skills or about apprenticeships. It was on 16 August last year, which was the 28th anniversary of the death of Elvis, for the people who want to know.This government has committed more money to the business of training apprentices than anybody else in history. The results are amazing: 397,800 new apprentices in training - a 146 per cent increase, or an extra 161,000 new apprentices since 1996; 139,600 new apprenticeship completions in this last year - a 314 per cent increase since 1996, or an extra 33,700 completions; 168,200 commencements in trade and related occupations - a 33 per cent increase -  - My point is: what is the member for Ballarat really on about here? In the last 10 years there has been a 286 per cent increase in the number of people in training in Ballarat - almost 4,000 people. In the case of MaxiTRANS, the member for Ballarat has to account to the people of her electorate as to why she is attacking a company that employs a total of 577 Australians -  - including 70 professionals and 150 tradespeople. In the last few years MaxiTRANS has taken on Australian graduates as well as 68 new apprentices. It has also provided leadership training to its employees through the Ballarat TAFE and supported them in a number of other courses. At the end of the day, this company is doing its job in respect of training people. The issue of importing people from other countries is a separate matter. The member for Ballarat, who was been instructed by the AMWU to get up today and put forward this question, has decided to try to link them together. The Australian government's priority is the training of young Australians. The statistics that I have put on the record yet again today prove just how successfully our priorities are being executed.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for her question and for the interest she shows. As I am sure all members of the House will know, after the election of former Prime Minister Snyder Rini on 18 April riots broke out in the Solomon Islands capital, Honiara. I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute not just to the Royal Solomon Islands Police but to the members of the Australian police contingent, as part of RAMSI, for the enormous courage they showed in that situation. They had very little to defend themselves with, and they showed simply extraordinary courage.As honourable members will also know, very soon after, as the result of a request to the Australian Prime Minister from both the outgoing and incoming prime ministers of the Solomon Islands, defence and police reinforcements were sent in. They restored order in Honiara, and that order has remained to this day. Two members of the Solomon Islands parliament were amongst those who were arrested and charged for alleged incitement of the riots. This is a most serious charge, and its seriousness cannot be overstated.On Thursday, 4 May, the Solomon Islands parliament elected a new Prime Minister, Mr Sogavare. On 5 May, Mr Sogavare announced that the two members of parliament who are on charges will hold cabinet positions, with one of them to hold the position of minister for police. We are respectful of the sovereignty of the Solomon Islands, but Australia is surprised and deeply concerned by this move. I draw the House's attention to the fact that the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, said yesterday - it might have been the day before yesterday - that she was aghast at the appointments. We have made representations to the Solomon Islands government and have drawn to their attention our concerns. I hope to visit the Solomon Islands soon with the New Zealand foreign minister and possibly other ministers from other Pacific island countries. It will be an opportunity to talk to the Solomon Islands government not just about this issue that I have raised today but also about RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission in Solomon Islands, its role and what it can do.There is no doubt that RAMSI has been very successful since it was deployed in July 2003. Over 3,700 weapons have been seized and more than 5,000 arrests have been made. Courts have the capacity now to manage serious criminal and corruption trials, and the Solomon Islands have achieved the highest rates of economic growth at any time since the early 1990s. These achievements have been very warmly welcomed by the people of the Solomon Islands. An important point to make here is that, whatever criticisms there may be of RAMSI from what I might call the political class, the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands very warmly welcome RAMSI and are enormously supportive of RAMSI.But nobody should have any illusions about the size of the task which the Solomon Islands face. Since 2003, the Solomon Islands have achieved average economic growth of over four per cent, but that rate of economic growth would need to continue until 2025 just to reach the 1980 per capita income levels, which is quite a dramatic statistic. This will require enormous commitment to reform, it will require accountability to restore confidence to domestic and international investors and it will certainly demand very good governance. RAMSI can assist but, ultimately, the government and the people of the Solomon Islands are responsible for their own destiny. They must take their destiny into their hands. We are happy to help, but ultimately they will always be responsible for their own future.</DOC>

 - I think the last part was a commercial! I thank the member for Ballarat - and sit down, he said. At the end of the day, as I tried to explain amongst all of the baying at the moon from those opposite, Maxi--TRANS is a company that has lifted an enormous amount of weight in the Ballarat economy when it comes to training people. - We have almost 4,000 people in training in Ballarat. When Labor was last in office that figure was about 1,000. So at the end of the day there is a lot of work going on in Ballarat when it comes to training. The individual circumstances of individual workers, the relationship they have with their employers and the decision to train is a partnership that workers and their employers should forge. - What is absolutely critical is that Australian business understands quite plainly that investing in their workforce is exactly that - it is not a cost to their business; it is a form of investment.But at the end of the day it still comes back to where we were in March last year, when we were asked exactly the same sorts of questions: a vilification of people who have come from another country, not to take jobs -  -  - Methinks they protest their innocence too much! Those people come not to take jobs but in fact to create jobs. According to a MaxiTRANS spokesman, in relation to the people who have been stood down, due to whatever circumstances the company has decided, it has cut 35 to 37 unskilled or semiskilled jobs. But none of the people reduced from the company's casual workforce were qualified welders. At the end of it, that proves the point even further. This company has taken it upon itself to train people first - that is the government's priority. The training of Australians first has always been this government's priority.This is a bit rich coming from the mob opposite. In 1993, when he was the minister in charge of training, the Leader of the Opposition presided over the single biggest drop in apprenticeship numbers in Australia's history - 30,000 people in the dumpster. This government has more than repaired that circumstance, and the energy of companies like MaxiTRANS should not be criticised in this place under privilege by the member opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and for his very strong support of defence families in Townsville - who will, I can assure him, enjoy the budget. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced on behalf of the government that a further 240 Australian troops will be deployed to Afghanistan. They will be in the central southern part of Uruzgan province in Afghanistan. They will be drawn from the 1st Combat Engineers in Darwin and also from elements of the 1st Brigade, particularly for logistics. Bushmasters and ASLAVS, and their supporting crews, will come from 6th RAR in Brisbane. In addition to that the Australian government has also announced that the two Chinook helicopters, both of which have undergone a $25 million upgrade for their electronic warfare self-protection systems and avionics, will remain in Afghanistan until April.The Australian troops will be working with the Dutch. The Dutch will have 1,400 troops deployed in this North Atlantic Treaty Organisation led activity. It is very important that Australians appreciate that, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, this is a potentially quite dangerous mission. But it is one that is also very important. Of the 240 troops, about half will be tradies and engineers and about half will be protective forces for our own troops. They will also be working in very close partnership with the Dutch forces, which will include F16s and Apache helicopters.I can inform the House that the troops will be based in Tirin Kot. The reconstruction activities will take place at two sites and will include restoration and building of roads and culverts, of water reticulation, of sewerage programs and of basic infrastructure and will also include trade training.I notice that there has been some commentary in the Australian media today that perhaps Australia should not be in Afghanistan. Whilst to some extent that is understandable, it is important that all of us appreciate that, if we do not take up the cause against the Taliban and terrorist elements in Afghanistan - while it is in some ways quite remote from Australia - we will leave the next generation of Australians and other people throughout the world hostage to the kind of ideological insanity that killed innocent Australians in Bali. It is extremely important that we undertake our international obligations. For that reason, the government has committed these forces.</DOC>

 - No. This project has been flagged in this House for more than two years, initially as a Medicare smartcard, which the Labor Party pledged to take to the last election. In fact, I remember that the member for Lalor asked a question of the minister for health prior to the last election. - A gold smartcard! The minister for health held up a Medicare smartcard, a successful trial of which has been held in Tasmania over the last two years. There has been extensive community consultation in the lead-up to the development of this proposal. The creative proposal went to the government together with a proposed budget. KPMG did an independent assessment of the business case, and their strong advice was that the business case is essentially overwhelming for the card to be implemented. I particularly appreciate the public support from members of the Labor Party for the smartcard. There were a number of them, including the member for Lalor and the member for Wills. In fact, the Premier of Queensland has already beaten us to it and is implementing a Queensland smartcard drivers licence, and I particularly appreciate his support for that. We are happy to be as open and as transparent as possible on this project. - I have already indicated I am prepared to release the report. You have to catch up, Simon; there is nothing new in that. The first thing we need is for the Treasurer to be feeling a little generous tonight. If he is, then the project is well under way and, if that is the case, I am sure the opposition will join in the debate about just how good this card will be. I particularly appreciate the support of many Australians for the card. As the Prime Minister has said, the support, particularly from younger Australians, has been very strong. That is encouraging, because this card will replace 17 other human services cards. It will cut red tape for individuals and for business and it will be good for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Everyone acknowledges the keen interest that the member for O'Connor takes in the transport industry. Like all members on this side of the House, he is gravely concerned about reports that the states will proceed with increases in truck registration fees. I am delighted to inform the House today that the Australian government has decided that the road user charge paid by road transport operators will be unchanged this year. I plan to bring to the parliament very soon a declaration setting the road user charge at 19.633c a litre from 1 July 2006. That is the same figure that has applied for the last five years. So, for six years now, the Commonwealth has frozen the road user charge. At the same time as we froze the fuel excise level we also implemented a freeze on the road user charge. This decision will save the road transport industry at least $200 million this year alone and, of course, that saving will increase year by year.In addition, the federal government is about to abolish the arbitrary boundaries that were applied to the on-road fuel excise rebate and extend the scheme to petrol powered as well as diesel powered vehicles. Those changes will save the road transport industry about $130 million a year. With the federal government taking such a strong lead, it is disappointing that all of the states and territories are talking about putting up road transport registration fees. That is despite the fact that the National Transport Commission has established that there is already over-recovery from the registration fees for the largest part of the transport fleet. Most are already paying to the states more than their cost to the provision of infrastructure.Everyone accepts that the transport industry should pay its own way, and the industry is more than happy to do that as well. But, in the absence of offsetting linked expenditure by the states and territories for roads, I do not think there is any compelling case for the Commonwealth to increase the Australian government's federal interstate registration scheme. We have no plans to increase our own registration fees. The states should follow suit and give the road transport industry a fair go in these times of high fuel prices and heavy costs in the industry.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and acknowledge his very hard work lobbying for a new medical school at Deakin University, and I also acknowledge your own hard work in this regard. The government recently announced that there would be an additional 160 medical school places in Victoria, that Deakin would receive $18 million towards its new medical school and that Monash would receive some $5 million towards extending its existing medical school into the Gippsland. I can point out that, already, since 2000, the government has increased medical school places by 30 per cent, and about one-third of existing medical students are bonded to spend at least six years in country areas after they qualify. Since 2000, the government has created 11 rural clinical schools and 10 university departments of rural health. Currently, some 2,000 doctors receive an annual bonus of up to $25,000 a year for working in the country. The government has recently doubled to up to $15,000 the bonus that country GPs receive if they maintain skills in obstetrics and anaesthesia.There is obviously more to do here, but I can report that, since 1996, while city doctor numbers in full-time equivalent terms have increased by three per cent, GP numbers in country areas, in equivalent full-time terms, have increased by 24 per cent. As I said, there is more to be done, but I think all this demonstrates that the Howard government is determined to remain the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and note his support for all schools in his electorate. The Howard government supports parents in having a choice of schools to which they send their children. We believe that, having paid their taxes, all parents deserve some level of public support. Sixty-eight per cent of all students attend state government schools and receive 75 per cent of public funding; 32 per cent of students attend Catholic and independent schools and receive 25 per cent of total government funding. Our funding model, the SES model, is based on need. Schools in the neediest areas receive 70 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a state government school, and schools in the wealthier areas receive some 13.7 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school. Each year the Howard government increases its funding to schools by an average of 6.4 per cent.I am asked about alternative policies. Last week the Leader of the Opposition announced that Labor's schools hit list was dead. Members will recall Labor's schools hit list; it was under a funding model called the '21st century resource standard'. That was just a fancy name for ripping money away from some schools and giving it to others. It was a policy enthusiastically embraced by the opposition education spokesperson. It meant that $520 million would be taken away immediately from some schools - hence, the hit list.This week the Labor opposition has recommitted to a hit list. Its funding policy is now called a 'national resource standard', but it is the same funding model under another name. It means that funding will be frozen to 350 schools, affecting 220,000 students. Labor is ideologically committed to its attack on independent and Catholic schools. This is a hit list by another name. Labor ought to come clean and admit that not only is the Latham schools hit list alive and breathing but it is back.</DOC>

 - No, it clearly does not. Of course I did not specifically remember a cable, but that is not to say that I would not have read it. That is a completely different proposition. -  - When it comes to recollection, I would not have thought the opposition would want to make too many political points. We have the Leader of the Opposition who cannot even recall the names of Labor Party senators from South Australia. He cannot even remember the first names of the ones whose surnames he can remember. Those opposite should be a bit careful about going down this track. Of course I do not remember specifically the cables, but I have made the point, as I did to the Cole commission, that I would have read the cables. I said that in the Cole commission on 11 April. All of these statements are entirely consistent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey, who represents many remote Indigenous communities in South Australia. Many Australians are probably unaware that there is a small percentage of fellow Australians who are incapable of owning their own home where they choose to live and who are not able to own their own business or to start any enterprise. That is because we do not allow them to have ownership in their own right, because, under a system that has been in place since 1976, land in these areas can be owned only by corporations, not individuals. On 5 October last year, this government undertook to open up Aboriginal townships in these circumstances and, under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act, to establish long-term leases - such as the 99-year leases that occur here in the ACT. This would enable these Indigenous people to have exactly the same rights and the same aspirations as all other Australians - that is, to be able to own their own home, to be able to own their own business, to be able to grow and be part of the market economy. To date, in many parts of Australia, this has been simply impossible.Last week I travelled to the Tiwi islands to sign what I believe is an historical heads of agreement document with the Tiwi people. This will allow the town of Nguiu - the centre of the community - to be leased back. For the first time, these people can join in the economic benefits that this country has been enjoying. The people of the Tiwi islands have shown great leadership to step out from what could have been seen as a comfort zone. They are an inspiration to other Indigenous communities. They have embraced what the Howard government is putting forward to them and, in doing so, they are seeing a new future for their young people.While I was up there, I was also very pleased to announce that the federal government would add another $10 million to the community to enable them to establish a community secondary college. It is because they understand the value of education that they want to see a new path; they recognise that the path they have been on for many, many years has been substandard and has failed their community. They want to embrace home ownership, they want to be part of the market economy and they want to go forward. The Howard government stands by them and with them and will support them the whole way to ensure that they can enjoy the same rights, responsibilities and opportunities as all Australians.</DOC>

Actually, that is the job of Commissioner Cole. As I have often said, the member for Griffith will not be happy with the Cole commission until he himself takes over from Commissioner Cole as its head.In relation to instructions to Michael Thawley, from my recollection - I think the Minister for Trade would share my recollection - we thought Australian companies, including AWB Ltd, should be dealt with fairly and according to due process. That is my recollection. No matter how hard the opposition tries to beat this up, it has to face up to the fact that the government have set up an independent inquiry to examine the issue, and we look forward to it producing its report.</DOC>

 - What the Treasury secretary says to the Reserve Bank is a matter for the Reserve Bank; it is not a matter for me. I am rather amused, as I always am, by the member for Lilley, because his big point has been that the government should instruct the Treasury secretary what to say at Reserve Bank board meetings. Leave aside the fact that the board is independent. This is the point that really gets me: the Australian Labor Party's policy up until a couple of years ago was to take the Treasury secretary off the board so that he could not actually represent the government. - Two years ago the Labor Party said that the Treasury secretary should not be on the board, but now he should be going to meetings and he should be telling what the government is intending to do. There have been a lot of winners out of this budget, but the biggest loser has been the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - This is a budget which invests for the future of our country. It is a budget which has additional investment in road, in rail and in water and it is a budget which has significant reform of the taxation system in respect of business taxation, personal income tax and, of course, superannuation. In terms of the outlook the honourable member for Kingston asked me about, the government's updated economic forecasts are that the GDP will grow by 3¼ per cent in 2006-07. Robust commodity growth is leading to strong business investment, which is expected to drive growth over 2006-07. Business investment has grown 75 per cent in the past four years and is expected to stay high in 2006-07. Although household consumption is expected to slow, some of that will be taken up by business investment and improvements in exports, as I said earlier.The government's management of the economy has seen unemployment fall to a 30-year low. Since this government was elected 1.7 million new jobs have been created in the Australian economy, with unemployment falling to five per cent. The government has put in place a budget which will keep Australia growing in a low inflation rate environment, which will balance the budget and return a surplus for the ninth time in 10 years, which will be consistent with keeping people in work and which will be consistent with giving Australians the opportunities that they deserve in one of the stronger growing economies of the world, which is now debt free and which has great opportunities for the future.</DOC>

 - No, because -  - I love the member for Jagajaga - she just comes in at the critical time. Can I say to members of the Labor backbench: under no circumstances change your deputy leader. - She asked me what was different about 1995. Let me tell you. - I will respond to the member for Jagajaga's interjection. In 1995 there were two critical differences. In 1995 the Australian government owed $96 billion and today the Australian government has no net debt at all. The second thing, of course, is that in 1995 under the Australian Labor Party Australia's credit rating had been downgraded twice. Since this government was elected not only has this government repaid Labor debt but that credit rating has been upgraded on two occasions back to AAA. The Australian government's foreign currency bonds are now the highest rated premium bonds in the world. We went backwards under Labor. The coalition has taken Australia back to where it ought to be.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform him that, as a consequence of last night's budget, all Australians - people in Braddon and people in other electorates throughout Australia - will get a reduction in income tax. As a consequence of last night's announcement, Australia will now have four income tax rates: 15c, 30c, 40c and 45c. The thresholds will be $25,000 for the 15c rate, $75,000 for the 30c rate, $150,000 for the 40c rate and 45 per cent after that.The consequence of this is that the vast bulk of Australians, who have incomes between $25,000 and $75,000, will face no higher marginal tax rate than 30c in the dollar. They will not be subject to bracket creep. On 1 July, the top tax rate of 45c will apply to only two per cent of Australian taxpayers. When this government came to office, you went onto the top tax rate of 40c in the dollar at $50,000. If this government had indexed the labour rate, that top rate would cut in today at $64,000 but, as a result of last night's changes, that top rate will no longer cut in until you are earning above $150,000. That applies to only two per cent of Australian taxpayers. In addition to that, the government has introduced a low-income tax offset, which means that low-income earners will not pay tax until their income goes above $10,000. In addition to that, this government has introduced new family allowances.The reasons we have the opportunity to cut taxation are that we can fund our investments in health and ageing and education, we have had nine surplus budgets out of the last 10 and we have now repaid Labor's debt - the debt that was left to this country in 1996 by none other than the current Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance. This is what opportunity is about for all Australians, and tax reductions will 'incentivise' our tax system in Australia.</DOC>

 - According to my information, the overnight interest rates swap moved by one basis point, from 5.76 to 5.77. That is one basis point. I will have the Leader of the Opposition's figures investigated, but I always take his figures with a grain of salt. This is the man who, back in 1996, said a $10 billion budget deficit was a surplus. But there is one question that we are always happy to take from the Australian Labor Party: a question on interest rates. Those of us who have been in this place in opposition well remember the then Leader of the House and Minister for Finance presiding over a government which had home mortgage interest rates at 17 per cent. Whilst he was in office, through the whole period of the Keating years, the average home mortgage interest rate was 12¾ per cent, compared with an interest rate today of 7½ per cent.Mr Speaker, if you were paying the 'Kim Beazley average rate' - not his highest rate but his average rate - you would be paying another $215 on a standard mortgage loan today. So the evidence is there. This is the government which has so run economic policy as to keep interest rates low. We will continue to manage the Australian economy so as to keep interest rates low, and they will be substantially lower than the Australian Labor Party's 12¾ per cent. If the Australian public want to make an assessment of records in relation to interest rates, we would invite them to do so because there is one person who would be coming down the bottom of the list and he goes by the name of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can inform her that the constituents of Makin, like other Australians, will benefit from the largest superannuation reform in at least two decades and, if you exclude bad reforms like the big one two decades ago, one of the best that has ever been made in respect of superannuation in this country. This is a plan to radically cut through the complexity of the superannuation system. It is a plan for no tax on end benefits: no tax on end benefits for lump sums and no tax on end benefits for pensions if you are in a taxed superannuation fund and you take your earnings after the age of 60.As a consequence of that, we will now no longer need different rates for pre 1983 and post 1983, for pre 1994 and post 1994, for capital gains exempt, for getting the rebate and for a whole host of other complexities currently in the system. We will now no longer need reasonable benefits limits or age based limits because we will have one standard, universal limit. This will make superannuation an attractive savings vehicle for all Australians, and it will give people certainty in their retirement as a consequence.The reform of the Australian superannuation system is broad-ranging reform and it is being undertaken by this government as part of its major tax reform in relation to income tax and business tax. It is a reform that will make retirement easier to understand. It will boost standards of living in retirement and it will boost Australia in a way in which we want to build our country into the future.</DOC>

 - I do not know the particular circumstances to which the Leader of the Opposition is referring, but I do know something about the way real wages have moved under my government compared with how they moved under the government of which he was a member. As I have said frequently in this House, when it comes to the impact of industrial relations changes, my guarantee about real wages is my record. What the budget has done is to address in a very real way the concerns of millions of Australian families who are obviously feeling the impact of higher petrol prices.I am interested that the Leader of the Opposition mentions petrol prices, because I seem to recall the Leader of the Opposition doing an interview on 6PR, I think in October or November last year, when he was asked whether it was a good idea to cut the petrol excise. He said: 'No, it's not. The way in which you help people with higher petrol prices is to cut their tax.' And that is exactly what this government has done.I am fascinated with the Leader of the Opposition, because I heard him this morning say that the tax cuts in the budget were long overdue. That is very interesting. They are long overdue in 2006, but who voted against them in 2005? None other than the person who asked me the question. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition has a lot of credibility in asking me about so-called triple whammies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her obvious passion for the families in her electorate. She is only too well aware that, since 1996, the federal government - the Howard government - has more than doubled the number of child-care places and more than doubled expenditure on child care in this country, providing more opportunities for families. Last night the Treasurer announced a further major investment in child care by the Howard government. For the very first time, not only will long day care be uncapped but family day care will be totally uncapped and outside of school hours care will be uncapped.This means that, if a constituent in the electorate of Greenway, in the suburb of Glenwood, for argument's sake, were to come to the member for Greenway and say, 'I need an after school care place in that suburb,' she does not have to say, 'I have to wait for some bureaucratic round.' She can say, 'Let's do it. Let's go and produce it,' because the federal government will fund those places as long as they meet the basic criteria of safety. We will have uncapped family day care. We will have uncapped outside of school hours care and we will have uncapped long day care.With this government's assistance, we will see more people entering the workforce and more women entering the workforce for the first time. We are extending the support through JET so that, when these people are making that crucial decision to go from welfare into work, not only will they get the child-care rebate and the child-care benefit but they will also be able to have most, if not all, of that gap paid in some instances so that they do not have to see child-care costs as a barrier at all. That is the commitment that the Howard government has to people re-entering the workforce and to giving them choice in child care.We are spending nearly $10 billion over the next four years on child care, and we believe compliance is essential. So we will be ensuring that not only every child-care place is a quality, safe environment but every taxpayer's dollar is spent on delivering a child-care place. We will be doing that through a maintenance program using new IT, rolling it out across the country, supporting it with compliance and uncapping the places. This is fundamental reform which will give parents choice in where they place their child and which will ensure that they can have the quality of child care that they deserve.</DOC>

 - I think the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs just explained the answer to that very well. What he said was that, as long as there is no cap on places and there is unfulfilled demand, any eligible person who can set up a facility is free to do so and to attract child-care benefit. I know that in my electorate there will be plenty of schools that will want to set up outside school hours care. Up until now, the problem has always been that the places were limited. I do not know if the member for Sydney is in contact with schools in her electorate, but certainly the ones that contact me say, 'Can you lift the limits?' I am going to go back to them and say: 'There no longer are any limits. As a consequence, if you have people who want to use a service, set it up and get it going they will get the child-care benefit and, in addition - something the Australian Labor Party never had the wit to introduce - a child-care rebate which from 1 July this year is going to give a 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket costs up to $4,000 per child per annum.' Let me put that in context. If you have two kids in child care, that could be $8,000. If you have three kids in child care, that could be $12,000. These are great announcements that would be welcomed by Australian families, and we look forward to the Australian Labor Party supporting them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Of course, the electorate the member represents is a significant contributor to the export effort and the strength of the Australian economy at the moment. The budget delivered by the Treasurer last night is strong and comprehensive. It has been delivered through good government, good economic management and, most of all, through the discipline with which the government has managed the Australian economy over the last 10 years - a discipline which had not been shown by previous governments in Australia, particularly Labor governments. I congratulate the Treasurer on his fiscal prowess in delivering this budget - for striking the right balance for all Australians in this budget.The budget forecasts that exports will rise by seven per cent in volume terms in 2006-07, and that is off a relatively high base, so exports are going to continue to grow. The budget announced an extra $2.3 billion investment in much needed transport infrastructure, which is going to be crucial in getting exports to the ports and out of Australia. The announced increase in the depreciation allowance to 200 per cent for businesses will encourage investment by Australia's exporting businesses. It will make them much more competitive in the international marketplace. As well, the budget provides $23.3 million to continue our TradeStart office network across Australia to reach out, encourage and help new exporters in particular to get into export markets. It also contains $160 million for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, which, particularly for new exporters, is a very valuable resource for getting into new markets and supporting their efforts in opening up new markets.Importantly, the budget delivers another surplus. A $10.8 billion surplus in the Australian economy is forecast. It is further proof of the government's stable and sound economic management of this country. We will continue to maintain a strong and stable economy, which is the most important thing the business community needs to compete in the international marketplace. This is a responsible budget which invests in critical infrastructure for the future. It also invests in research and development in technology, and it gives the private sector the opportunity to invest in their future and be more competitive on the world stage.</DOC>

 - It was interesting to look at the prop the member for Griffith was holding up. He was holding it upside down. In all the years the member for Griffith referred to, there has been in trend terms a continued growth in exports out of Australia - apart from one year. I point out to the member for Griffith that in 2005-06 to date there has been a 17 per cent growth in exports out of Australia to $140.5 billion, and we are on track to achieve the seven per cent growth forecast in this budget in 2006-07.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can point out to him and to other members that the Howard government does not just talk about Medicare but invests the money necessary to make a good system even better - $48 billion in the coming financial year, as the Treasurer said last night with, I thought, a note of justifiable pride in his voice. But it is not just the quantity of the spending; it is the quality of the outcomes which count. That is why medical research is so important, because it is today's research which produces tomorrow's medicines and technologies which will keep millions of Australians happier and healthier.Australia has always punched above its weight in health and medical research. We have produced no fewer than six Nobel prize winners in this area. Aspro, penicillin, the heart pacemaker, the ultrasound scanner and the bionic ear were all developed by Australians or in Australia. And last night's budget reinforces this great tradition: there is $905 million in new money for medical research. That means that national health and medical research funding will increase fivefold, from $127 million in 1996 to $700 million a year at the end of this quadrennium. It means new infrastructure for Australia's great medical research institutes like the Walter and Eliza Hall, the Garvin, the Florey and the millennium institute at Westmead Hospital. I want to say that last night's budget substantially delivered on the major recommendations of the Grant and Wills review, and I want to congratulate John Grant and Peter Wills on their consistent vision and commitment in this area.</DOC>

 - The member for Jagajaga is wrong again in her assertion and her assumptions. Whilst those opposite spent all of last year talking down and in fact trying to deny Australians tax cuts, they took their eye off the fact that we put a record $1 billion extra in last year's budget towards skills and skills development - in fact, over four years, over the current quadrennium, $10.1 billion. And last night we continued it: the Treasurer put $181.6 million into a range of new programs to meet Australia's continuing change in skills demands - that is, an extra $106 million over four years for new apprenticeships centres, an extra $6 million to fund the coordination of national skills shortages strategies, and on and on and on it goes. What the Labor Party has not focused on is the effort of last year which produced a record amount, a record investment and the challenge to Australian businesses to take full advantage of those circumstances.</DOC>

 - Firstly, can I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and for his interest. The government has given a very high priority to not just protecting Australia against terrorists but making sure we work with our regional neighbours in order to enhance the capacities of the region as a whole to deal with the problem of terrorism. Under this budget, the government will provide an additional $92.6 million to boost the capacity of countries in our region to fight terrorism. South-East Asian countries are front-line countries in the fight against terrorism and we have been collaborating with our neighbours to a very substantial extent. Counter-terrorism initiatives in the region are now worth something like $400 million since 2004. The fact is that our robust approach to counter-terrorism in the region is saving lives and is helping our regional neighbours to deal with the problem of terrorism. Terrorist networks have been disrupted and over 300 terrorists in South-East Asia have been tracked down and brought to justice. For example, as recently as 29 April the Indonesian police raided a house in Central Java, arresting two associates of Noordin Top and killing two other terrorists and seizing explosives. A number of terrorist trials are under way in Indonesia, including four which commenced yesterday, relating to the October 2005 Bali bombings.The fact is that a number of Australian agencies are helping particularly Indonesia but also other countries in the region to fight terrorism. In the budget, the AFP and the intelligence agencies will get $34 million to continue this work; Customs, $7 million; the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, $10.9 million; nuclear safety agencies, $5 million; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, $35 million. I think that, apart from the United States, there is no other country that makes a greater contribution to the counter-terrorism effort in the region. It is an important theme of and component of our budget that, in the task of securing Australia and continuing to deal with the international security threats we face, we give such a high priority to assisting our regional neighbours to counter terrorism.</DOC>

 - I make two points about this. First of all, it is I think unprecedented for an opposition the day after a budget to run out of questions on the budget after six questions. I have sat in this parliament for 21 years and I have never seen an opposition give up on questions on the budget after just six questions. May I congratulate the Treasurer on a great job and a well-done job. Secondly, there are two completely different propositions here. Would I have seen the cables? I told the House that I am sure I would have. Did I specifically remember the details of the cables? Of course I did not - it was six years ago - but I explained to the Cole inquiry that I would have seen some of the cables. If the honourable member looks at the evidence given before the Cole inquiry and reads the transcripts, he will see that the two statements were entirely consistent.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for returning to the budget, because, since the tragedy of the twin towers attacks of 2001, the Australian government has reviewed and improved every aspect of our national security arrangements. But we must never become complacent or assume that the task is complete. In other words, we should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security. Last night's budget continues to build upon our comprehensive record in this regard. The key initiatives funded in the budget include a fulfilment of our five-year strategic plan for ASIO, building the organisation to an unprecedented level of staffing and enabling it to explore unexpected and emerging sources of threat as well as existing sources of concern. It also includes boosting the Australian Customs Service, as part of our determination to protect Australia's northern borders for security and fisheries purposes. It increases the intelligence and surveillance capability of the Australian Federal Police. It continues our commitment to hosting a safe and secure APEC meeting in 2007, and there is also the roll-out of the National Document Verification Service and the establishment of three new ID security strike teams to further protect the identity of Australian citizens.These and other budget measures are a further reinforcement of the government's first priority, which is keeping Australia safe. It is a measure of our commitment to the safety and the security of the Australian people, which is one of our primary human rights obligations.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question and I ask him to listen carefully to the response. It does not prove anything of the kind, and the reason that it does not prove anything of the kind is that the emails which form the basis of the Leader of the Opposition's question, and which form the basis of an erroneous report in the Australian newspaper this morning, were in fact exchanged in February 2005, not in September or October 2004. They were exchanged a week after I had received a memorandum from my department drawing my attention to the displeasure of the Volcker inquiry with the lack of cooperation from AWB and a week after I had given clear written instructions that there had to be total cooperation and disclosure. Everything I have said on this has been totally truthful and consistent, and once again the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out misrepresenting the truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He spent much of his pre-parliamentary working life in Australia's Defence Force. Last night the Treasurer announced on behalf of the government an unprecedented long-term commitment to Australia's defence. The government in last night's budget announced in total a $15.9 billion increase in investment in Australia's Defence Force over the next 10 years. That comprises $5.2 billion to add to programs that are already in place and to bring in new ones, such as the acquisition of four C17 Globemaster heavy airlift aircraft and $1½ billion to strengthen and improve the size of the Australian Army. It also involves $560 million to support important initiatives in Australia's reserves. But in addition to that, $10.7 billion has been committed by increasing in real terms every year by three per cent, above and beyond inflation, the amount of money the Australian government will invest in the Australian Defence Force from years 2011-12 through to 2015-16.What this means in plain language for many Australians is that we will be able to build three air warfare destroyers here in Australia, in South Australia. We will also be building two amphibious ships which will carry up to 1,000 troops and six helicopters. We will be acquiring, at a cost of around $15 billion, a Joint Strike Fighter. We will also be replacing, at a cost of around $2½ billion, the Army's trucks, trailers and land fleet. It also means that we will spend more than half a billion dollars more on improving the naval surface air warfare capacity.What this means for Australians and for the next generation of Australians is that, notwithstanding the uncertainty that we face, the Australian government and the Australian Defence Force will be well prepared for the future. We all need to appreciate that what is going to most influence and threaten our secure future is not always the things we know but the things we do not, and this government is determined that we will be prepared.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. Australia is not self-sufficient in oil. We import oil. We import the majority of our oil, which is why we are a price taker on international markets. If we were self-sufficient, it might be different, but we in fact are in the same position, more or less, as the Americans are, which is that we are price takers. Our oil predominantly comes from the Middle East, although it can usually be refined in Australia or, most likely, in Singapore.In relation to alternative fuels, the very high price of oil and petrol is making alternative fuels more commercial all the time. One of the things that this government has put in place as part of its long-term energy white paper is a preferential arrangement for excise on biodiesel, on LPG and on other alternative fuels. Can I also say that the government has in place grants to people for biodiesel and ethanol projects. I believe it is about $50 million which has been given out and expended completely to people who have those projects. I also indicate that the government has recently taken steps to reassure the market in relation to ethanol blends. Ethanol blends were taken off the market some time ago as a result of scare tactics principally coming out of the Labor opposition, but the government has put in place measures to reassure people in relation to blends. I believe that high oil prices will in a market sense make alternative fuels more commercial and that, particularly with preferential taxation, we will see the development of this industry, and that in fact will be a good thing.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler. This budget makes an enormous boost to Australia's infrastructure. It is a fantastic additional investment in roads and rail in Australia and will help us to achieve some of those important national objectives to improve communications around our country. Perhaps at the head of that list is the $800 million extra being provided to the Hume Highway. So now we are within sight of achieving one of those great national dreams of having a four-lane highway between our two biggest cities. Surely after all these years that is an important objective and one that only a government with the proper levels of fiscal responsibility has been able to achieve.But it is not just the Hume Highway that has benefited from this infusion of additional funds. There is $160 million more for the Pacific Highway. That brings to $1.3 billion the commitment by this government and the New South Wales government to upgrading the Pacific Highway. I commend the members from the Northern Rivers areas of New South Wales and northern New South Wales for their continuing efforts to ensure that this very significant piece of New South Wales state road infrastructure is appropriately funded. It is still a significant task to complete that upgrade, but it is wonderful that there is an additional contribution now to speed up that activity.There is another $268 million to improve the road between Townsville and Cairns - a really significant investment in flood immunity in that region. I notice that the member for Kennedy, like the opposition, when asking a question the day after the budget could not even bring himself to ask about that most important piece of infrastructure development, most of which is in his electorate and will certainly benefit everyone travelling on the Bruce Highway in Northern Queensland. There is $323 million to upgrade roads in Western Australia, $100 million for the road between Gawler and Nuriootpa in South Australia, $30 million for flood upgrading in the Northern Territory and $270 million for the Australian Rail Track Corporation to improve the rail track network around Australia. All of those projects are very significant investments. It is all new money available immediately. It is on top of the $12.7 billion in AusLink network investments and will certainly make significant improvements in a whole range of our key regional road areas. - Someone opposite interjects, 'What about regional areas?' What about the Roads to Recovery program, with $307 million? Every local authority in Australia has now got more money to spend on local roads and local streets in projects of their choice, and this will make a very significant difference as well.Naturally, this infusion of additional funding for roads has been widely welcomed around the country. Almost every commentator has spoken with enthusiasm - the NRMA, the Tourism and Transport Forum and Commerce Queensland. Even the South Australian Labor Treasurer said that this was a balanced budget and a budget that recognises the need for road upgrades and investment in our defence forces and the Murray River. So all sorts of people have been giving endorsement to what is really an outstanding budget.I can only find one critic of this investment and that is Senator Kerry O'Brien. He does not want money to be spent on road infrastructure. He wants it instead to be spent on creating a bureaucracy called 'Infrastructure Australia' to do yet another audit of road needs. We know the problems. We are getting on with fixing them.</DOC>

 - This is a budget for the future because it has massive investment in national infrastructure: $800 million for the Hume Highway, another $220 million for the Bruce Highway -  - $45 million in relation to Tully flood works, the largest increase in national health and medical research spending ever, $300 million in Roads to Recovery funding, $36 billion worth of income tax cuts and the most ambitious superannuation policy that Australia has ever seen. This is a budget that has been received well by the Australian community and even endorsed by the Australian Labor Party. There is no point coming back into the House and trying to renew an attack today after surrendering yesterday in the first question time following the budget. The paucity and the feebleness of the attack of the Australian Labor Party on this budget illustrates what Australians know: it is a good budget, it invests for our future and it is right for our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She is right in her question to raise concerns about the barriers that exist against young people receiving in this country genuine training opportunities. There are two areas of concern that the government has that are working against opportunities being available to young people. They are the continuing opposition to school based apprenticeships in both New South Wales and Western Australia. This is a matter that I raised at the COAG meeting in February this year. At that meeting I received an undertaking from all of the premiers. Let me say that in some states of Australia - and Queensland is a state that comes to mind - there are no barriers to school based apprenticeships. But in New South Wales the union dominated award system results in there being barriers to school based apprenticeships. The existence of these provisions still in both New South Wales and Western Australia is holding up the formation of four of the Australian technical colleges in those two states.Why is it that technical colleges are open for business and going ahead in Queensland but they are not in some other states? I notice my colleagues representing the aspirations of young people in these parts of Australia nodding in agreement because they know that the opposition to school based apprenticeships, which we all know is nurtured by the union movement, which has a stranglehold on the apprenticeship system in New South Wales and Western Australia -  -  - Yes, I do. In relation to this, I certainly do give credit where it is due and deliver criticism where it is deserved. On this issue the union movement is holding back training opportunities for young Australians. As a result of that I have written to both the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of Western Australia urging them to use the authority of their office to make sure that these barriers against school based apprenticeships are removed.If anybody imagines that the imperfections between the various states of Australia do not produce absurdities, let me remind the House of some of the absurdities that exist in the very disuniform, dysfunctional training system between the various states. For example, a qualified carpenter cannot move from the ACT to New South Wales - and that is not very far - without having to get a licence from -  - the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading, which may require a further formal assessment and additional costs. Trade Recognition Australia can consider an electrician from the United Kingdom to be competent but, when he or she arrives here, they have to resit a trade test which can take up to eight months and they cannot work in the meantime. A hairdresser who has gained a hairdressing qualification from a private college in Victoria can get a job in London but not in Western Australia. These are some of the barriers to training opportunities. But the worst barrier of all is the opposition in New South Wales and Western Australia. They are states with which my opposite number is very familiar. The existence of school based apprenticeships in those two states is standing in the way of training opportunities for young Australians. They ought to be swept away, and I hope the Leader of the Opposition joins me in urging the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of Western Australia to improve the training opportunities for young Australians in those two states.</DOC>

 - Australia's current account deficit is governed by both exports and imports. The period in which the current account was last in surplus was around 2000-01, when the Australian dollar was at 47c or 48c. One of the features of having a very high exchange rate, as we have at the moment, is that imports are much cheaper in Australian dollar terms and exports are much more expensive in Australian dollar terms. Because of the high commodity prices and the high exchange rate, the Australian economy is sucking in a lot of imports which, except in commodity areas, are affecting our exports. We expect that the rapid investment in Australia's mining industry over recent years, where there has been something like $30 billion of investment, will boost capacity and ensure that volumes of those exports go up. As a consequence of that, exports will be stronger in the years that lie ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He is referring to the release of the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook in 2006. I inform the House that, according to the world competitiveness scoreboard, in 2006 Australia moved from ninth place to sixth place as the most competitive economy. According to this survey, the No. 1 competitive economy in the world was the United States, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, Iceland, Denmark and Australia. On the world competitiveness scoreboard of large countries - countries of 20 million people or more - Australia ranked second, because Hong Kong, Singapore, Iceland and Denmark were not included.The World Competitiveness Survey has four broad areas: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure. Australia has moved up in the rankings on economic performance. Australia performs extremely well on the ranking of government efficiency and business efficiency. Australia is also ranked in relation to infrastructure.The IMD began preparing this competitiveness survey in 1989. In 1989, Australia was ranked 10th in the world. Over the next six years, we declined to 16th in the world, in 1995. In 1995, the current Leader of the Opposition became Minister for Finance. When he became finance minister in 1995, we dropped from 16th to 21st in the world, which was our lowest ranking ever. The Australian economy bottomed out to 21st in the world under the Labor Party government - a period which the Leader of the Opposition seems to have completely erased from his memory, but he has a history and he has a record, and he will be reminded of his record over and over again in the years to come. Anyway, we bottomed at 21st in the world, the government was thrown out of office, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance was thrown out of office, and Australia has been coming back ever since, reaching the sixth position this year.Comparing Australia with other developed economies in the world such that we came in sixth - or, as a large country, second - is a comparatively new thing. Back when the Labor Party was in office, the Labor Party did not like to compare Australia with other developed economies. Who could ever forget the report that was given by the then Assistant Treasurer, the then member for Canberra, Mr McMullan, when he attended the IMF meetings in Washington in 1991? He reported as follows on his return from Washington:Three things struck me during the course of the meetings:  first, we should never forget our relatively favourable situation.I read the words published by the Assistant Treasurer:As I have said before in these articles, when compared to the problems of Mali, Peru or Bangladesh, all Australians should rejoice in our good fortune.We do not compare ourselves with Mali, Peru and Bangladesh. These days, we tend to compare ourselves with the developed economies of the world. Australia has moved from the ninth to the sixth position, and that is a result of strong economic management.</DOC>

 - I would like to say something about foreign debt because, as a result of this government, the Australian government owes no net debt. -  - As a result of this government, the Australian government has no net debt. As a consequence -  - As a result of the efforts of this government, the Australian government has no net debt. We have repaid $96 billion of Labor debt. What that means is that all foreign debt in this country is borrowed by the private sector - every single last dollar. More than that -  - As a consequence of that, every dollar that has been borrowed overseas is owned by the private sector. In fact, if you break it down, 80 per cent of the foreign borrowings of Australia are held by the commercial banks - that is, foreign debt is held by Westpac, the National Australia Bank, ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank. - We have done stress tests in relation to those banks and, as a consequence of those stress tests, the RBA, the IMF and the Australian government are satisfied that Australian banks, which are amongst the most profitable in the world, are not exposed in respect of their borrowings and are quite able to handle those borrowings. Let me repeat: unlike 1996, not a single dollar of foreign debt -  - Unlike 1996, not a single dollar of foreign debt or any other debt is held by the Australian government. All of it is held by the private sector and principally by the commercial banks.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question, because there has been a lot of talk over the last week or so about the role of state occupational health and safety systems under Work Choices. As I made it clear last week, and I make it clear again today, occupational health and safety falls clearly under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. Indeed, this was conceded in the High Court by the Solicitor-General for the state of Western Australia in the current case.The reality is that the new workplace laws, Work Choices, do not override the jurisdictional responsibility of the states and territories. Employers must continue to meet their obligations under state and territory occupational health and safety laws. In the legislation in every state and territory in Australia there are significant penalties for those who do not meet their obligations. So, contrary to the misleading and hysterical claims that are being made by the Leader of the Opposition, workers can continue to receive training under Work Choices.Today we had the Leader of the Opposition - as we have had him over the last few days - on the Today show on Channel 9 suggesting that it was an 'absurd and, indeed, evil thing in the industrial relations laws that workers would be forbidden' - his word - 'from receiving safety training and union training'. That is the claim made, once again this morning, by the Leader of the Opposition, which has also been made over the last week or so.It is interesting that, while this is what the Leader of the Opposition is saying, there are at least some members of his frontbench who know that that is not the case. My office was contacted by a concerned member of the public who had emailed a question to the member for Lilley. The question stated:So the impression being given that employers are subject to $30,000 fines if they send employees to Union run safety training courses is misleading?That was the question emailed to the member for Lilley. After consulting - according to the email - with the member for Perth, this was the answer that was given. Remember the question: 'the impression given that employers are subject to a $30,000 fine if they send employees to union run safety training courses is misleading'. The email back from the office of the member for Lilley says:Yes, that is correct.It goes on:Employees attending union run training cannot be included in an agreement as a condition of employment, but an employer can send employees to union training.Whilst we have the Leader of the Opposition making claims, as he was again this morning on Australian television and as he has been doing for the last week in this country, at least the member for Lilley and presumably the member for Perth were prepared to tell the truth when asked a question directly by a constituent about this. This gives the lie to what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. The whistle has been blown once again on the Leader of the Opposition, and I table the emails.</DOC>

 - How does it feel? It feels 12 places better than when the Leader of the Opposition was in government. That is how it feels. When the Leader of the Opposition was in government, we were ranked 21st. Last year we were ranked 12 places better, and this year we are ranked a massive 15 places better. - Too clever by half; the question was: 'How does it feel?' Let me tell you how it feels. It feels 15 places better than when the Labor Party was in government. I think there are 16 teams in the AFL; if you rose 15 places you would go from the bottom to the top - and it is because this government reformed the taxation system, balanced the budget, paid off debt, saw Australia through the Asian financial crisis, came through the international recession of 2000 and put 1.7 million people back to work. So how does it feel? It feels really good to have no Labor government in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I can inform him that in April the labour force figures showed that the unemployment rate in Australia was 5.1 per cent, marginally up from what it was in March. While part-time employment fell in the month of April by 25,900, full-time employment increased in April by 22,700. So, although we lost 25,000-odd part-time jobs, we gained 22,000-odd full-time jobs. As a consequence, although the unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.1 per cent it is still at 28- or 29-year lows.How does this compare with previous unemployment rates in Australia? I would like to take the House back to May 1993, when the unemployment rate - and bear in mind that today it is 5.1 per cent - under a Labor government was 10.6 per cent. The then Labor government commissioned a caucus committee, chaired by the member for Lilley, to come up with ideas as to how to solve unemployment - which was then at 10.6 per cent. The chair of the caucus committee, the member for Lilley, came up with a great idea for reducing unemployment. His idea was to drop the age qualification for the age pension from 65 to 60 and reclassify everybody over 60 as retired rather than unemployed. He told the AM program on 31 May 1993 that the pension age could be lowered to 60 and they could be put on provisional age pensions. He said it was cruel for men aged 60 to 65 -  - When it was pointed out that putting men aged 60 on the pension may not solve the whole of the unemployment problem, the member for Lilley said one of the other options that they had was to drop the age pension qualification age to 55 for men, to reclassify everybody over 55 as retired and to put them on the age pension. Can I say nothing would have been a more short-sighted policy, because we now know people are living longer, we now know we want them to engage in the workforce longer and we now want to encourage them to work, because the problem in Australia today is not mass unemployment. Let me make this point to the House: mass unemployment is a Labor outcome. Labor produces mass unemployment. Mass unemployment is not a problem today. Today your problem is going to be more like finding enough workers, because there are enough jobs for people to get in the Australian economy. This government does not believe in reducing the age pension and giving it to 55-year-olds so it can reclassify them out of the unemployment queues; this government believes in getting people real jobs in the real economy. And 1.7 million new jobs have been created under this government because we never gave up on the unemployed, we never accepted Labor's solution, we never changed the definition and we gave them an opportunity in life, an opportunity they would never have got under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - As I said in the budget speech on Tuesday night, in 1996 there were 300,000 child-care places; in 2009 - wait for it - there will be 700,000 child-care places in Australia. That is a more than doubling over the last 10 years. How does the government go about child care? Firstly, with the child-care benefit; secondly, with the child-care rebate which will become payable - 30 per cent of out-of-pocket costs up to $4,000 per annum per child - and, thirdly, with no cap at all on places. That means an eligible church, an eligible council or an eligible private operator can set up in any area where there is excess demand and can have a facility which will attract government funding. This is broad ranging, wide term reform which will mean that the opportunities will come to create those child-care places for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I am happy to say to the member for Ryan and to his constituents that this has been a great week for Medicare. This week's budget commits $1.9 billion to mental health, there is $250 million to the health workforce and there is $500 million to the Australian Better Health Initiative, as well as a record $905 million in new money for health and medical research. In a year when our economy is tipped to grow to $1 trillion, federal health spending will reach $48 billion. And there is a clear message in this: Peter Costello is the best Treasurer Medicare has ever had.I have been asked about alternative policies, and let us give credit where it is due. I applaud the Leader of the Opposition's belated decision to finally dump the Medicare Gold policy. It takes a bit of guts for Mr Twenty-Four Per Cent to ditch the policy belonging to Madam Thirty-Two Per Cent over there, but that is what he said last week. This week the member for Lalor was asked, 'Will you be maintaining some of the principles of Medicare Gold?' and she said yes. And just this very day I go onto the ALP website and I see a reference to a Medicare Gold ad which has the voice of Mark Latham saying: 'No more delays, no more waiting lists; this is an important extension of the universal coverage of Medicare. We call it Medicare Gold.' So they have taken his hat off the website but they have still got his ad on the website. And the website encourages people to play this ad over and over and over and over again, so you have got the ghost that walks, you have got the policy that talks and it is still on the Labor Party's website. I will say this: a political party with no health policy whatsoever will never be in government. It will never be in government, and it does not matter how many speeches he gets Bob Ellis to write for him.</DOC>

 - That depends, of course, on the amount of demand and the number of people that are going to supply them. But we said in our budget that we expect to have 700,000 in 2009, an additional 25,000 places, which makes it 400,000 more than ever existed under the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member very much for his question and his interest. Australia provides excellent consular services. They are at least as good if not better than those of any other country, and I think other countries appreciate and recognise this. We have 173 consular locations around the world - that is, DFAT posts, Austrade posts and honorary consulates. We also have a consular-sharing agreement with Canada at 24 different posts.There has been an enormous growth in the demand for consular services. Australians make almost five million overseas trips a year, and that represents a 40 per cent increase over the last three years. In 2005 DFAT managed an unprecedented number of major overseas emergencies. Honourable members will recall the tsunami, the London and Bali bombings, the Douglas Wood kidnapping in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, to name the most important of them. In the six months to December 2005 consular operations assisted some 10,800 Australians, following on from the 25,000 Australians who were assisted in the previous 12 months.I just make the point that there is enormous demand for these services, and it is important that the government does its best to try to meet that demand. Obviously there are circumstances where we are limited in what we can do. Nevertheless, in the Treasurer's excellent budget we have committed an extra $80.2 million over four years to manage the growing demands of consular casework and to enhance our contingency planning and crisis response capabilities. Included is funding for additional DFAT as well as Austrade consular staff in Canberra and overseas, backed by an enhanced training program and a major upgrade of DFAT's crisis and case management systems and the DFAT crisis centre.In conclusion let me say two things about this. First of all, we as a government have been very committed to providing good consular services. That has been a very high priority for me, for the department and for the government as a whole. Second, and I often say this, ultimately there is a limit to what we can do. Certainly, when it comes to the law, there are no special laws for Australians overseas. Australians are required to abide by the laws of the countries which they visit. If Australians do at least allegedly breach those laws - certainly if they are convicted for a breach of those laws - there is very little we can do. It is not possible for the Australian government to spring people out of foreign prisons. People have to adhere to the laws of the countries or the jurisdictions within which they find themselves.</DOC>

 - This government has put in place a system of training and apprenticeships which is better than anything Australia has had for a decade. The budget includes $1.4 billion in initiatives to promote vocational education and training, including $537 million to extend youth allowance to apprenticeships. It has $350 million for 25 Australian technical colleges. It has $143 million to improve careers advice. It has $120 million for tool kits and $106 million for the Commonwealth trade-learning scholarships. The total funding for VET has more than doubled over the last 10 years, from $1 billion in 1995-96 to $2.55 billion in 2006. So funding has more than doubled since the Australian Labor Party was rightly thrown out of office. This support is delivering results. The total number of new apprenticeships doubled from 156,700 in 1996 to 397,800 in September 2005. The number of new apprenticeships in traditional trades increased from 120,000 in 1996 to 168,000 in September 2005.So on any measure, whether it is spending, whether it is apprenticeships, whether it is VET or whether it is Commonwealth investment in technical colleges, the Commonwealth has a bigger investment now than it has ever had in the past. One of the good things is that, if you are training at the moment and you do get a trade or a skill, your chances of getting a job are very good. I have been in this House since 1990, and I never, ever heard anybody complain about the difficulty of finding workers for jobs back in 1990. I heard a lot of complaints about the fact that there was mass unemployment and a shortage of jobs for workers. In the six years of Labor government that I experienced whilst I sat in opposition I never, ever heard anybody ever suggest that there was a problem in finding workers for jobs. Why? I will tell you why, Mr Speaker: unemployment was at 10.6 per cent. If I had the choice between an economy in which there were more jobs going than workers and an economy in which there were more workers going than jobs, I know which one I would choose. I know which one the Australian public would choose. I know what the Australian public would think the better problem was: a shortage of labour rather than excess labour. Let me say it again: the Labor Party is a party of mass unemployment. That was its record in 1993. The Liberal and National parties in the coalition stand, above all else, for jobs, and there have been 1.7 million new jobs in Australia since 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and acknowledge his particular interest in the Cairns airport and indeed the other major airports in Australia. He is as aware as any of the solid effort that this government has been putting in over recent times to improve security at Australian airports and to ensure that Australia's travelling public have a safe and secure environment. This budget is further demonstration of the government's commitment to aviation security. As a result of this budget we have now committed $886 million in response to the Wheeler review recommendations. It is a very significant commitment.There is $355 million to improve community policing at airports and $176 million for additional counter-terrorism first response capabilities at our major airports, and that is on top of the existing expenditure on that counter-terrorism function and our canine capacity at those airports. There is $48 million for new initiatives for cargo security, and a significant amount of that will be for additional mobile X-ray units and explosive-detecting dog teams to examine the cargo that is placed on our aircraft. There will also be more money for explosive trace detection equipment and for a variety of trials to test some of the promising new emerging technologies in relation to security and explosive detection techniques.These are very significant initiatives and bring to $1.1 billion this government's investment in aviation security initiatives since September 11 2001. We take aviation security seriously. We are committed to a safer and more secure environment for all Australians who travel in the skies. It is perhaps evidence of the opposition's interest in this issue that they have not bothered to comment at all on the importance of these matters in their response to this environment. They are full of criticism, but in reality they do nothing.</DOC>

 - As I said earlier, the Australian government has set aside money to build Australian technical colleges: $350 million for 25 of them. Four of those technical colleges are currently open, in Port Macquarie, east Melbourne, Gladstone and the Gold Coast. This is the first time the Australian government has ever set aside money for technical colleges, and people might wonder why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to get into the business of funding and establishing Australian technical colleges. The reason why it took until 2005 for the Australian government to establish Australian technical colleges was that, since the dawn of Federation, the states used to run technical schools which were open to secondary students who wanted a career. Why are those technical schools no longer open in the state of Victoria? There are now no technical schools. Let me tell you why, and it is very instructive: when the socialist Left took control of the Victorian government, under Mother Russia herself, Joan Kirner - the same faction as was advised by the then junior member for Jagajaga - they decided as an arm of policy to abolish technical schools in the state of Victoria. It was an arm of policy. It was decided that all students should go to comprehensive high schools and, as a matter of policy, all technical schools in Victoria were closed. -  - In addition to that, the Australian Labor Party, under John Dawkins, adopted a policy of sending every student to university. That was not appropriate for a lot of students who needed technical training. - As a consequence of that, people who were not aiming at university study were required to go into technical training -  - As a consequence of that, there were people who were apt at technical training, who wanted it and who would have appreciated it who were pushed into the university stream. A consequence of that is they did not have the opportunity to go to an Australian or in fact a state technical college. This is the government that stepped in to remedy that defect. This is the government that set aside $350 million to do what no Australian government has ever done. This is the government that is setting up those Australian technical colleges, and for $350 million in 25 colleges it will be a very worthwhile investment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and very strong commitment to Australia's Defence Force. On Tuesday night the Treasurer announced a record increased investment in Australia's Defence Force - $15.9 billion of additional expenditure over the next 10 years. That included a number of measures which are about not just the acquisition of new tanks, ships and aircraft but also significant initiatives to improve the recruitment of Australian Defence Force men and women for the regular and also the reserve forces. Further, $194 million has been committed over the next four years to provide financial incentives for the recruitment and, indeed, the retention of Defence Force personnel, particularly in 25 of the 225 areas where we have significant shortages in recruiting and retaining key people.We are also going to focus increasingly on rehabilitation and invest another $17 million. Whereas previously Defence took the approach, when an injury was sustained by a soldier or sailor, of having that person discharged, increasingly we are now working on the rehabilitation of them, both physically and emotionally, and returning them to the services. In addition to that, $184 million was announced for reserves over the next four years. That will include not just an increase in the daily tax-free payment for all reserves by $10 but also health allowances of up to $2,500 a year and increased bonuses of $5,000 a year for those who basically complete each year of reserve service.Attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force is not just about money. Money is extremely important, but it is also important that we live in a society that values service in the Australian military. I will very shortly be receiving a report which the government commissioned from Avril Henry, which will recommend to me and the government for consideration a range of reforms. It is about our making sure that the families within Defence are cared for. It is about postings. It is about a nationally consistent education system. It is also about making sure that Australian Defence Force cadets are valued in Australia. Whilst cadets represent one per cent of their age cohort, they represent 10 per cent of those who join the Australian Defence Force.One of the first things the Labor Party could do, if it is serious about attracting men and women to the Australian Defence Force, is have the New South Wales government, for example, have Australian Defence Force cadets in its schools. It is extremely important that we live in a society that values service in the Air Force, the Navy and the Army as highly as if not more highly than many other occupations. It begins with leadership and, in particular, it begins in schools. I commend to all Australians, and as a parent myself, membership in the Australian Defence Force. It is a wonderful way to make a difference to our society and bring security to our world.</DOC>

 - We as a government have done more to improve skills training in regional Australia and give access for young people in regional Australia to vocational training and to university places. There has been a significant debate about skills since Tuesday night. I know that the minister responsible has responded to this. Today the Treasurer has responded in detail. Can I just say that, on the Australian technical colleges, two of the campuses that are up and operating happen to be in my electorate. The basis on which they are there is that the private sector was running one of them before we announced our policy in the 2004 election.The reason is that the state Labor governments were cutting back on the vocational training opportunities across Australia. We announced a policy of rolling these out across Australia and providing opportunities for year 11 and year 12 high school students to link in with industry and be trained in advance of them taking up apprenticeships. This is a policy that has been initiated by this government, expanded by this government and funded by this government in this budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and note his interest in schools funding in his area. Under the Howard government, we will be investing $9.3 billion in schools across Australia this year, and that is a record level of funding. There will be $33 billion invested in Australian schools over the period 2005-08. That is a 59 per cent increase on the previous four-year funding period.Last Tuesday in this House, the Leader of the Opposition took exception to what I said about Labor's rehashed schools policy. He did not like it when I made reference to the fact that, under their national resource standard, what will happen is that over 350 schools and 220,000 students will have their funding frozen. After question time, the Leader of the Opposition said in this House in relation to Labor's funding policy - and we have to listen to this carefully:... they would be adjusted in order to ensure their real value - that would be an upward adjustment - kept pace with inflation.Under current arrangements, every school in Australia receives a funding increase according to the average increase of the cost of sending a child to a government school. That has been running at an average of 6.4 per cent. Now, under Labor they would not be receiving their 6.4 per cent growth funding every year; each and every year under Labor there would be a 3.4 per cent cut in growth funding to schools. The Latham schools hit list is back - make no mistake. The Leader of the Opposition let the cat out of the bag. They are currently receiving 6.4 per cent. Labor have tied it to inflation. Inflation is running at three per cent. That 3.4 per cent funding hole would leave massive deficits in schools' budgets. -  - The Leader of the Opposition said Labor's funding policy would keep pace with inflation. Currently schools are receiving an average of a 6.4 per cent increase; Labor are committed to a three per cent increase. That massive 3.4 per cent decrease will leave holes in every school budget, and Labor ought to come clean and admit they are still punishing independent and Catholic schools.</DOC>

And that is on top of the $50 million a year announced some 12 months ago or thereabouts. That will enable us to double the current levels of apprehension and increase our surveillance capability to deal with Indonesia in a number of ways at stopping-off and departure points. So, frankly, the government has addressed this issue full-on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. He well knows how well received the federal government's budget has been by farmers, rural communities and their representative organisations. The National Farmers Federation has stated that it is the most positive yet for regional Australians. The Victorian Farmers Federation has described it as the best budget in 11 years for rural Australia - and no wonder, because it is new and increased funding of $700 million for agriculture, fisheries and forestry.A major feature of the budget initiative is to improve retiring farmers' capacity to access the age pension. This government has announced new treatment of rural land under the pension assets test, which means those of age pension age living on rural properties who have at least a 20-year attachment to the land may have their property excluded from the assets test for age pension and carer payments. This is a remarkable and not yet widely enough understood initiative by the government. This announcement will allow up to 10,000 retired farmers a higher rate of pension or access to the pension for the first time. It will improve their living standards and allow them to remain in their family home on the family property, which has often been in the family for generations.This side of the House understands primary producers, farmers and rural communities - and no wonder. Looking over my shoulder I can see grain growers, cane growers, wool producers, meatworkers, jackaroos, shearers and stock and station agents, but on the Labor Party side - because I am asked about alternative policies - there is but one who has dust on his boots, who comes from a primary production background, namely the dairy industry, and that is the member for Corio. He is the only one. If the Labor Party will not do anything to save its agricultural spokesman, they will not do anything for rural Australia.</DOC>

 - The Work Choices legislation actually makes it quite clear, by precluding occupational health and safety matters from the legislation, that the legislation of state governments stands and the occupational health and safety legislation that they put in place remains the law. Under state laws employers will continue to be required to meet their health and safety obligation, which includes appropriate training.I have heard allegations, including some from the next putative Labor leader, Mr Shorten, on the weekend, that somehow trade union officials are prohibited from engaging in occupational or training courses. I have no higher authority that this is false than the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer. In an email - from Mike Murphy to Victoria White in the member's office - Mike Murphy asks this question:... the impression being given that employers are subject to fines if they send employees to union-run safety training courses -  - I have answered it already. - So Mike Murphy goes to the office of the member for Lilley and asks:... the impression being given that employers are subject to fines if they send employees to union-run safety training courses is misleading?And Victoria White comes back and says, 'Yes, that is correct: completely misleading.' From the member for Lilley's own staff:Employees attending union-run training cannot be included in an agreement as a condition of employment but an employer can send employees to union training.So there you have it: you have it from the legislation that the state legislation stands, and you have it from none other than the member for Lilley's staff that they can go off to the courses - and to suggest to the contrary is completely misleading and completely false.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that Australia is well placed to meet the increasing global energy demands, particularly those coming out of China. Listen to these figures: Australia has eight per cent of the world's proven coal reserves, we have two per cent of the world's natural gas reserves and we have 40 per cent of the world's low-cost uranium resources. This places us very well indeed as a global player in relation to energy demands.When I was in China in October last year, I raised the prospect of an 'energy freeway' between the south and the north of Asia by which Australia could supply the growing demands of that country and ensure that it has long-continued and reliable supply. The energy freeway will not be built by countries trying to get ownership of resources to lock other countries out. It will be built by ensuring there are deep liquid markets with reliable suppliers under enforceable contracts which give certainty and security under a framework of law.Australia has a unique role to play in the energy freeway between the south and the north of Asia. We have entered a 20-year contract for gas to China, one of the biggest export contracts we have ever had. We know about Australia's coal contracts. But can I also suggest that Australia has a great opportunity in the export of uranium, of which we hold a larger proportion of the world's reserves than we do in relation to gas and coal.I cannot imagine any person interested in Australia's economic future banning the export of uranium to countries that observe proper safeguards and nuclear standards. Such a decision would be completely contrary to the Australian national interest. Nobody in their right mind would think that we would deny ourselves export markets for gas or coal. Nobody in their right mind should deny Australia export markets for uranium, provided they are countries with safeguards which comply with international obligations. On this side of the House we believe that Australia should have the best export future it could possibly have, and our export future lies in our energy exports to a growing demand in the north of Asia.</DOC>

 - Any apprentice who was seeking a visa to undertake training in Australia could only get one if a regional certifying body certified that no suitable Australian was available. A government member - How do they know? 
 - These regional certifying bodies are set up, authorised and supervised by state Labor governments. -  - Doesn't that come as a surprise! So the state Labor governments set up regional certifying bodies. They have to be endorsed by the state Labor governments. For present purposes we believe that the state Labor governments are not failing in their duties. The regional certifying bodies have to give that certification. That being the case, no Australian would be displaced from a training opportunity by this visa. I make it clear that foreign apprentices have to pay full fees and that they are not eligible for tool kits, Commonwealth trade learning scholarships, youth allowance or any other Australian government assisted measure.ACTU President Sharan Burrow was reported in the Australian on 15 April 2005 as saying that she did not oppose fee-paying overseas students taking up apprenticeships in regional Australia 'as long as it is not at the expense of local students getting their opportunities'. That is why we have regional certifying bodies. -  - I conclude by saying that in September 2005 there were 397,800 apprentices in training, which was a 146 per cent increase on 1996. So there has been a 146 per cent increase - a record number of people in training - a regional certifying body which is supervised by the state Labor governments and a policy which does not cost Australian apprentices any opportunity whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I note his genuine concern for the people he represents in Darwin and the Northern Territory and his understanding of this very difficult issue. The federal government this year committed a record $3.3 billion to assist Indigenous Australians to have a better life. As we have all seen this week, horrific incidents of child abuse and domestic violence are occurring throughout Australia, which is totally unacceptable. This has occurred despite the best efforts of all levels of government of all political persuasions over a long period of time to deal with it. Today, the Co-Principal of Wadeye School in the Northern Territory reiterated how challenging this is. I remind the House that Wadeye is the site of a COAG trial where the Northern Territory government and the federal coalition government committed and spent some $40 million over the last three years on a range of programs in this community of 2,500 people. We are talking here of domestic violence programs, of interventions after the event, of employment programs and of housing and infrastructure programs across both the Territory government's and the federal government's range of portfolio responsibilities. Despite this genuine commitment by the Northern Territory government and the federal coalition government, there is still a belief that there is no future. Let me explain by reading what the co-principal had to say to the ABC today. She said:I'm seeing people very scared, intimidated, afraid to speak out. Shop access is blocked, therefore food supplies are restricted. The health clinic access is difficult because they can't get there. I've had to offer the school as a shelter when houses have been vandalised.Her husband is the local GP. He said he recently treated a six-year-old child who had been raped. He says that the Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services told him not to talk to the media. Unfortunately, these are not isolated incidents. The fact is that the best of goodwill and the best of intentions will do nothing unless we are able to address the fundamental issue that every society not only demands but relies upon to be successful - the basis of rule of law and that policing be present, be visual and be trusted. That simply does not happen in these communities. - There are four police operating in the town of Wadeye. Up to 300 people have been rioting in the streets, with some $300,000-plus damage done to housing there as out-of-control youths rampaged through the streets.This week I called for a summit of state and national leaders in order to have an action agenda that will address this fundamental issue. I have asked in goodwill that the territory and the state leaders send people to a summit with the federal government because, whilst law and order always has been and is today a state and territory responsibility, the disgusting things that are happening to the children of this nation are also a national responsibility. This government is prepared to stand up and work with state and territory governments to overcome it.We are prepared to put resources into this issue. Last week I announced in Alice Springs a further sniffer dog team. Why? Because across the Northern Territory, South Australian and Western Australian borders there is not only drug trafficking and petrol trafficking but also abuse occurring that only further police resources will fix. People must have confidence: they must have confidence to report crime and they must have confidence to stand in a court of law and give evidence. Today they do not have that confidence.I welcome the contribution by the National President of the Australian Labor Party, Warren Mundine, who has put partisan political views aside and has recognised that now is the time to act as a nation. I ask again all state and territory leaders to join with me to ensure that we together allow every Australian to have the right to live in their home safely, to have faith in the criminal justice system and to know that police will be there when they need them. It is not too much to ask. This is something on which we must put party political views aside and address. It is a national disgrace. It requires a national answer. I ask all those leaders to participate in the goodwill that is intended.</DOC>

 - I think that Australian workers work very hard, and they work very hard for increased wages under this government, unlike its predecessor. Real wages have increased by 16.7 per cent under this government. If there was ever an experiment in restricting wage increases, it occurred under the Australian Labor Party between 1983 and 1996.Having said that, our country does operate a skilled immigration program and it always has. It did through the fifties and the sixties. There are a lot of people who are in this parliament today because their parents came out here in the fifties and the sixties as skilled immigrants. Skilled immigrants were welcome in Australia in the fifties and the sixties and they will be welcome now. They will be welcome if they can come to this country and bring their skills with them and contribute to the development of the Australian nation. I do not want anybody to run around here and try to impute, as the shadow minister did, that somehow skilled migrants are not welcome in Australia. - I am giving my views on skilled migrants and skilled labour. I am asked my views about Australian workers and Australian wages and I will give my views. My views are that what Australians want more than anything else is a job, which they are getting a lot more of today than they were under the Labor Party. What they want is a decent wage, which they are getting. In addition to that, they also welcome the fact that people with skills can come to this country and contribute. Our government has a skilled migration program, which will continue. It has been vastly improved in recent years, ever since the last government was thrown out of office.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden. I think all members of the House know of his interest in foreign affairs. Certainly he has followed this issue very closely. The government is very pleased to congratulate Iraq and the Prime Minister of Iraq particularly, Mr al-Maliki, on the formation of a new government. This is a momentous event for the people of Iraq to at long last have their own democratic government. In reality it is probably fair to say that it is the first genuinely democratic government Iraq has had since that country was created in 1922. So it is a momentous event. It is a triumph of democracy over the forces of terrorism and violence.There was an expression of views by the overwhelming majority of the people of Iraq in their elections in December 2005. Something like 12 million people went out to vote in those elections. Although there are insurgents and terrorists trying to destroy that democracy and trying to destroy the wishes of those 12 million people - although there are people who want to sabotage the freedom of the people of Iraq - those people have shown the courage to vote and the politicians whom they elected have shown the courage to put together a government.This is a government that brings together the different strands of the country - the Kurds, the Sunnis and the Shia. I think it demonstrates a point very clearly: that the leaders of Iraq do not want their country to break up, despite the fact that terrorists and insurgents do want it to break up. The terrorists and the insurgents are endeavouring to destroy the country. It is encouraging that the members of the parliament were able to agree on a government and the government will now be able to take that country forward.There is no doubt that the new Iraqi government will face enormous challenges, but let them know that the government of Australia will certainly support them and will certainly support democracy in Iraq. We will not adopt the defeatist view of others, including the opposition, that it is much better just to abandon Iraq to the insurgents and terrorists and turn our backs on the 12 million people who went out and voted in that country. I think that is the wrong thing to do. This government may be a lot of things, but this government will never be called 'defeatist'.</DOC>

 - One of the things that have worked against Australia's exporters in recent times, as most people would know, is the exchange rate. The last time Australia was running a trade surplus the Australian dollar was at US47c. I think that today it is at about 75c, but it has been as high as 77c. One of the reasons for that is that the Australian currency is perceived to be sensitive to commodities. That is one of the reasons why the Australian dollar is at the level it is at - and, by historical standards, since the float of the Australian dollar, that is a high level. I acknowledge the fact that this is making things more difficult for Australia's exporters of manufactures, because they are not getting an increased price and yet are having to cope with a higher Australian dollar. We acknowledge that. That is one of the difficulties for Australian manufacturers in this country. - I am reminded by the member for North Sydney that one of the things that did help them was taking taxes off exports. - Psychobabble followed by exaggerated laughter - that is what the Leader of the Opposition does. When he cracks a joke with no punchline, he provides the canned laughter himself. It would be more convincing if someone joined in. Taking taxes off exports was one of the things that assisted Australia's manufacturers, but Australia's manufacturers are at the moment dealing with a very high dollar. The good news in relation to our commodities is that more investment is going into mining infrastructure in particular than ever before in Australia's history. That is giving us capacity, it is giving us the opportunity to exploit new markets in the north of Asia and it is one of the reasons why the Australian economy is one of the stronger economies in the world at the moment.</DOC>

 - I can tell the honourable member for Bass that the reforms announced in the budget in relation to superannuation have been overwhelmingly received in the positive. That is because this is the largest reform of superannuation we have probably ever had in this country. Some might think that is a big claim, but I draw endorsement for that claim from none other than former Hawke government minister Susan Ryan, who in the Australian on 12 May 2006 praised 'the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but slightly shabby superannuation property'. She said that 'it strikes as a wonderful reform' and 'the ex-Labor minister backs super moves'. Under this superannuation reform there will be no tax on end benefits coming out of a taxed superannuation fund, there will be no tax on lump sums coming out of a taxed superannuation fund, there will be no tax on pensions coming out of a taxed superannuation sum, there will be no need for reasonable benefits limits, there will be no need for age based limits and there will be no need for quarantining between pre-1983 and post-1983 contributions. IFSA, the Investment and Financial Services Association, said:The effective removal of end benefits tax and tax on super pensions is a major step towards the simplification of an overly complex superannuation regime.The AMP said:The proposals eliminate most of the complexity around end benefits and this will boost confidence and transparency _Susan Ryan, in her opinion piece in the Australian, said:Costello's uncharacteristically bold and effective plan - I do not agree with everything she said on 12 May - to simplify super and reduce its taxes should be commended.These are major changes to superannuation. Susan Ryan wrote in the Australian on 12 May:'These are the most important changes to superannuation ever,' Peter Costello boasts. They're even more important, he claims, than the 1992 introduction by the Keating government of compulsory super. The Treasurer can often overstate his case, but this time he's right.That is what Susan Ryan said in the Australian on 12 May. These reforms are warmly endorsed. They cut through the complexity of super. They give Australians the chance to save and to know how to deal with their savings. These are bold reforms and we look forward to the Labor Party announcing a position in relation to them.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister will get a very warm reception back here on Thursday. We look forward to seeing him just as much as the member for the Northern Territory does. But every now and then you come across a political party that is demoralised. Here we are in Australia with all sorts of economic issues, where people are interested in petrol prices, interest rates and jobs for their kids, and you have some drop kick asking a question like that. If that is the level of the attack that is coming out of the Labor Party, I have but one piece of advice for you: bring on Bill Shorten.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and for his strong support of not only the resources sector but particularly the uranium sector. He has been a staunch supporter also of the expansion of Olympic Dam to give South Australia some real opportunities. The uranium sector is making an important and growing contribution to Australia's economy. According to Geoscience Australia figures, uranium exports are now worth some $573 million. With more than 40 per cent of the world's low-cost reserves, Australia is uniquely placed to supply even more of the world's uranium needs, and this government is working hard to see that realised, provided of course that the appropriate non-proliferation, safety and environmental safeguards are in place.While this government is providing a clear position on uranium mining, the same cannot be said for those who sit on the other side. The member for Grayndler says that Labor has 'essentially an anti-uranium position' and that there is no change needed to the no new mines policy that Labor has. The member for Hunter, though, has a far more enlightened approach, describing the same policy as 'silly', 'illogical' and 'contrary to our economic interests'. The member for Batman, of course, is well known on this issue. He says, 'We can't pretend we're half pregnant on uranium' - a position supported I see today by the heir apparent, the union leader Bill Shorten.In a situation where we need courage and strong leadership - the sort of courage and strong leadership we are seeing from this government - it is situation normal from the Leader of the Opposition, who is unable to make a decision and says in relation to uranium issues, 'They're not urgent matters before us now.' That view is not even shared by those who sit on his side of this parliament. The member for Batman says, 'People thinking we can put off those debates until we win government are just stupid.' That raises the question: is the Leader of the Opposition's policy on uranium based on stupidity or just the usual lack of ticker?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. As the House would be well aware, the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, appointed Brigadier Elizabeth Cosson, who was supported by Professor Donald Sheldon, to prepare a report into the circumstances of the unacceptable and erroneous repatriation of Private Kovco's body to Australia. Late on Monday night last week, just after 10 o'clock, the Chief of the Defence Force phoned me to inform me that Brigadier Cosson had apparently lost the disk which contained the draft report into this unacceptable incident. I was advised that it had been thought to be lost either at the Qantas lounge in Melbourne or, alternatively, in a taxi.Naturally, I asked the Chief of the Defence Force to do everything that could possibly be done to see that the disk was located. I understand, and I was advised, that that would also involve some discussion with the taxi company on the Tuesday. For obvious reasons, I would not inform the public or, indeed, the Kovco family until such time as I could be assured that the disk was not recoverable, because to do so would have caused an unacceptable and unnecessary degree of distress to the Kovco family. In relation to hypotheticals, they are not questions that I would answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question and for her interest. I visited the Solomon Islands on Friday and Saturday with my New Zealand counterpart, Winston Peters. The Treasurer will remember that he was once the Treasurer of New Zealand. We held talks with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr Sogavare, as well as the foreign minister, Patterson Oti. The Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands told us that the Solomon Islands government was committed to what we call RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands.Winston Peters and I made it clear to the Prime Minister that, as the key donors to RAMSI, we did not want to see the integrity of RAMSI in anyway diluted. RAMSI is a total package, and we do not expect the Solomon Islands government to cherry pick bits off it that might be seen to be inconvenient. For example, to have the Solomon Islands government withdraw the officials from the finance ministry who are trying to assist the Solomon Islanders to get the country's finances into shape would be something that we would regard as unacceptable.Of course, we are happy to finetune RAMSI here and there, in relation to it doing more tasks and doing some of the tasks that it does even better than it is doing them, but not to start downgrading RAMSI. We look forward to discussions with the Solomon Islanders, in particular on the issue of training more Solomon Islanders to do some of the tasks, in the fullness of time, that are being conducted by RAMSI. We have also made it very clear that one of the key issues for the Solomon Islands is combating corruption. We stressed the importance of that to the Prime Minister, to the foreign minister and publicly as well. Obviously, RAMSI has been doing a good job.Let me make two final points. First of all, we do reject the criticism of RAMSI during the recent riots. I think the Australian Federal Police and state police officers who had to deal with the riots showed enormous courage. I do not think that that courage has always been properly recognised, at least in the media. I think it has been recognised by the parliament but not in the media. They showed enormous courage in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Any suggestion that somehow they are responsible for the riots is preposterous. The people who were responsible for the riots were the people who incited and conducted the riots.There is an allegation that two people were involved in the incitement of the riots, Mr Ne'e and Mr Dausabea. It was announced by the Prime Minister that they would be ministers. We made it perfectly clear - I am sure that every member of this House agrees with this - to the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands government that to have people who are facing charges for inciting the riots appointed as ministers, one of them as the police minister, is, at least for us as Australians, completely unacceptable. Of course, the Solomon Islands can make up their own minds about their own government; we do not have to approve of it. And we certainly do not approve of people in those circumstances being made ministers. I am pleased that the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands has now at least appointed acting ministers in those roles, if not abandoned those appointments altogether.Solomon Islands has a very long way to go as a country. It has been growing quite well in the last three years, since RAMSI has been there, at around four to five per cent a year. But for the Solomon Islands to return, at least according to the IMF, to its per capita living standards of 1980, it will have to maintain its current rate of growth until 2025. That puts into some context the sheer challenge that that country faces. We are happy to help it but, ultimately, the destiny of the Solomon Islands does not rest with us - it rests with the Solomon Islands people and its government. I hope that RAMSI will be able to continue beyond 23 July, the deadline by when the mandate has to be renewed by the Solomon Islands parliament. I am confident it will be renewed. It is important that the full integrity of RAMSI remains in place.</DOC>

 - It is interesting, isn't it, that it is this side of the House which is suddenly very interested in bulk-billing and that there is such silence from members opposite. The member for Kingston is understandably interested because in just one year the bulk-billing rate in his electorate has gone up by almost 13 per cent. I can inform the House that the GP bulk-billing rate went up again in the March quarter. It is the ninth successive quarterly increase and it takes the national GP bulk-billing rate up to 75.7 per cent - that is, 9.2 percentage points higher than in December 2003. That means almost nine million GP consultations a year that were previously not bulk-billed are now bulk-billed. The GP bulk-billing rate for children under 16 is up to 83 per cent. It is an all-time high. The GP bulk-billing rate in country areas is at 69.9 per cent. It is an all-time high.Members opposite say the GP bulk-billing rate is not what it was in 1996. Let us look at overall bulk-billing rates for GPs and specialists. They were 71.1 per cent in March 1996. In March 2006 the overall bulk-billing rate was 72.2 per cent. Bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, especially for pensioners and children. This government is not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had but, on these figures, the best friend bulk-billing has ever had.</DOC>

 - No, they will not. In relation to salary packages, where people are able to access pre-tax dollars for child care, as exists at the moment, the flipside is you cannot access the child-care benefit or the child-care tax rebate. The same rules that apply to any other employees at the moment will apply to those who may be eligible to take up an offer out of the human services agency. - If the honourable member would like to listen, we are answering the question. You cannot go out there and pretend you are interested in all of these child-care issues and then just interject from the front bench when you get the answers. It would be advisable to actually listen.The tender that has been released from Centrelink today to establish an employer provided child-care program is looking for an additional 40,000 places. One of the conditions of this is that it will not be taking away places from other Australians. If Centrelink does commission another 40,000 places, far from that hindering other Australians, it will be adding to the market and actually providing more child-care places - which one might have thought the Labor Party would actually be interested in. The arrangements that will be put in place are the same arrangements that apply to all other people - that is, you cannot get the benefit and the rebate if you take advantage of this. This is currently applying to other employees as well. Centrelink's contract will not require the contractor to freeze fees for five years. Fees must be based on a user-pays system at competitive local market rates.The government is spending $9.5 billion to support child care, and there are now nearly 600,000 funded places available. That compares with about half of that number back in 1996. Here we have a government with record places, record funding and uncapped places so that the market can rise to meet demand. We have the child-care benefit, with an additional child-care rebate coming into force, and those who do not want to take up that option may have the option of employer provided facilities. This is the biggest investment in child care that has ever been made by any Australian government. The tender that is being placed by the department of the Minister for Human Services complies with Commonwealth government salary packaging laws, complies with tax laws and complies with child-care requirements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I was delighted to be with him and quite a number of business operators in his electorate in Perth last week. There has been quite a deal of misinformation in the media over recent days about occupational health and safety and the Work Choices legislation. Let me re-emphasise the basic point - that is, occupational health and safety is the responsibility of states and territories in Australia. - As I was saying, section 16(3)(c) of the Work Choices legislation specifically provides that the occupational health and safety regimes of the states and territories continue to operate. Under those state and territory laws, if an employer fails in their duty of care to provide a safe workplace, there are penalties. Where an employer fails to provide occupational health and safety training, there are also strong penalties under state and territory laws.So it was somewhat bemusing to see Mr Bill Shorten on the television news last night declaring shamelessly that, because he had spoken about occupational health and safety at the Beaconsfield mine site, he was 'an outlaw'. Can I say to Mr Shorten that he has not broken any law by speaking about occupational health and safety at the Beaconsfield mine site. - Indeed, as the Treasurer points out, he is in no danger of being declared an outlaw and not being able to take his seat in parliament. It may worry the Leader of the Opposition a little, but he will be able to get here. But neither Mr Shorten nor anybody he spoke to at Beaconsfield - or, indeed, at any other workplace around Australia - has broken the law in this matter. Of course, some members of the opposition know this, because we had the exchange of emails with the member for Perth and the member for Lilley. We had the office of the member for Lilley saying in an email, which found its way to a constituent, 'An employer can send employees to union training.' - These are words from the office of the member for Lilley. This was reinforced again this morning by the member for Perth, who spoke at a doorstop this morning. He was asked this question: 'Why do you need those leave arrangements if employers are required to provide safety training and can do so?' This was the reply from the member for Perth: 'I would've thought that Beaconsfield shows that one of the things which are important is leave arrangements for training to take place at the Lithgow mining rescue centre, which is jointly run by the CFMEU and the Minerals Council of New South Wales, and more than one of the people involved in the Beaconsfield rescue had training there.' Precisely the point, Mr Speaker, from the mouth of the member for Perth. - The agreements which pertained to the workers at Beaconsfield did not provide specifically trade union training leave. Those agreements provided that the laws in Tasmania about occupational health and safety would be carried out -  The member for Prospect then left the chamber. 
 - What happened in Beaconsfield in the past is precisely what can happen in Beaconsfield in the future - namely, that under Tasmanian occupational health and safety legislation, those workers can go to training, conducted jointly by the Minerals Council and the CFMEU, the relevant union. They have been able to do that training in the past; they can continue to do that training in the future. What this shows once again, and what is borne out by the email from the member for Lilley's office, which acted on the advice -  - 'More lies', we hear from the member for Perth, whose advice you acted upon. What we see, is an email relying on the advice of the member for Perth and distributed by the member for Lilley. What it shows, once again, is that whilst the member for Lilley, the member for Perth and others will say one thing publicly, they can see that it is quite the opposite privately.</DOC>

 - If the Leader of the Opposition cared to ask about agreements which have been approved by the Office of the Employment Advocate, he would find that, since 27 March, there have been a number of agreements which provide for occupational health and safety training as part of those agreements. The reality is -  - The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition, seeing his campaign and his scaremongering about Work Choices falling flat, is using more extreme examples all the time. - I conclude on this note: there have been a series of agreements approved by the Office of the Employment Advocate which provide in those agreements that occupational health and safety training be provided to employees. In addition to that, section 16(3)(c) of the Work Choices legislation specifically provides that state and territory occupational health and safety laws, including the right of union officials to enter a workplace, is preserved under that legislation. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. He made a foolish statement a couple of weeks ago, but he knows that the state and territory occupational health and safety laws continue to operate in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for the question. The Bruce Highway is very important to his electorate; it is the main access route to Fairfax and indeed to the whole of the Queensland coast. It is a very important road, and one which the Australian government have committed to provide significant funding for under the AusLink arrangement - with a further $268 million boost for the northern sections of the highway in the recent federal budget. We are also committed to 'four-lane' the Bruce Highway past Gympie by 2020. Projects have been under way, particularly around Caboolture, for 'six-laning' - to endeavour to achieve that objective.About 18 months ago, the Australian government commissioned consultants to undertake a study on the route for the next 62 kilometres of the highway, between Cooroy and Curra. That project is well advanced. The consultants have had out for public comment six alternative routes that might be considered for the bypass of Gympie and the upgrading of the highway. There has naturally been public concern about each of those routes, because of the large number of properties that will be affected.Imagine the shock of everybody in the region, a year and a half into this study, to find out that the Queensland government intends to flood nine kilometres of the existing highway and nearly all of the options that have been under consideration. It is going to flood the areas where we have been designing new roads. The Acting Premier, Ms Bligh, has said that the government has known about these proposed dams for a long time and that everybody should have been aware that it was going to happen. If that is the case, why didn't the Queensland government include this piece of information in the parameters for the study? It designed the terms of reference and has been involved in the steering group, but it did not bother to tell anybody that it intended to flood nine kilometres of the area that is under study.The questioner asked: are there any impediments to the progress of the upgrading to a four-lane highway? There is a fair bit of impediment. A lot of the area is going to be under water. It is not just the road that is going under water; 870 properties are likely to be flooded, including Queensland's largest dairy farm. The impact on the dairy industry will be such that Queensland will probably cease to be self-sufficient in dairy products. The town of Kandanga will go under water and will probably have to be moved entirely. At least 1,000 people will be moved out of their homes for this mega-dam that the Queensland government has just invented over recent days. I am told that drilling for this dam site has started. Armed guards are surrounding the drillers. Early word is that the dam site is likely to be unable to support a structure of this nature anyhow.The reality is that the Labor government in Queensland is trying to hide its debacle in the health system by flooding half of its constituents and putting out of business a most significant road building project for Queensland. This is an appalling example of deceit and dishonesty by the Queensland government. The reality is that there will be no capacity for us to maintain the pace on the construction of this vital highway network until we know what parts of Queensland the Labor government intends to flood next.</DOC>

The Acting Prime Minister would be too humble to spruik the fact that in the budget the government abolished the cap on child-care places. Because the government abolished the cap on child-care places, we were able to remove that provision from the new tender - because now there are an unlimited number of child-care places.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker, who has an intense interest in restoring the Murray River to being a healthy working river - as do a number of other members who sit in the government ranks and represent other communities. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council had its 40th, and arguably most productive and convivial, meeting last Friday. I thank my colleagues the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, for their constructive input.It always helps when the Commonwealth, in conjunction with providing national leadership, brings a big swag of surplus funding to support programs, as we did. We brought the budget's $500 million injection of funding - we injected $500 million, just to repeat the point - for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission's work. That takes the funding for the Murray-Darling Basin work for the Living Murray to $1 billion, of which the Commonwealth is contributing $700 million. Seventy cents in every dollar spent on the Living Murray will be from the Commonwealth on behalf of taxpayers and river communities. That means that a number of infrastructure works will be sped up and a number will be able to meet their original deadline. The government will also allow up to $200 million of its contribution to the purchasing of water from on-farm efficiency savings by way of a tender system that the parliamentary secretary is working up now.When you take into account the Commonwealth's investment - again, on behalf of taxpayers - by way of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, you are seeing billions of dollars being spent on the River Money - the River Murray. -  - Yes, there is a significant investment, but every cent is justifiable and every cent is required. That level of investment, that amount of money, is entirely justifiable, given that the basin is producing 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production.In conclusion, what is the Labor Party's alternative; what is their plan? We do not know. There is not a single word of explanation about how they would restore the Murray, how much it would cost or where the water would come from. In contrast, the government has put in a multibillion dollar investment which preserves and enhances the economic and environmental productivity of the great River Murray.</DOC>

That is because we have now processed all people who have made applications. We have also set aside housing arrangements for families to stay together. More than all of that, the government has done that whilst complying with its obligations under the UN convention on refugees and ensuring that Australia has strong border protection.

 - Can I thank the honourable member for Gwydir and acknowledge his deep interest in this issue over a long period of time. No Australian would be pleased to see the reports of violence in Aboriginal communities or the level of violence in Aboriginal communities which appears to be occurring at present. This is a problem -  -  - This is a serious issue, and I hope that the opposition will take it seriously, because I believe people of goodwill on all sides of Australian politics will want to see a situation where those who live in Aboriginal communities are safe - safe from rape and child abuse - and will want to see a situation where those people who perpetrate violence against others in those communities are brought to justice, prosecuted and punished.The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Mal Brough, has recently been on a tour of some of these communities to see for himself the level of abuse and violence. I want to pay tribute to him for the way in which he has taken on this issue so forcefully and thoughtfully.The government believes that there is no substitute for law enforcement in Aboriginal communities. The government believes that there is no such thing as a cultural defence for rape or child molestation. The government believes that, whatever the colour of a child's skin, it deserves a safe life; and the government believes that, whatever the colour of the skin of a perpetrator, that perpetrator must be brought to justice. The federal government pledges every support to the Northern Territory government and its police force in relation to bringing to justice those people who are reasonably suspected of crime, ensuring that they are processed by the courts and punished. The Commonwealth government stands ready to lend any assistance to the Northern Territory government to ensure that that policing function can be properly discharged.Yesterday I wrote to all of the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories to invite them to a summit on violence and child abuse called by Minister Mal Brough, the minister responsible for Indigenous affairs. I urge all premiers and chief ministers, including the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, to attend. The aim of the summit will be to develop a concrete set of actions to improve law and order in Indigenous communities, to strengthen policing of laws that protect children against abuse and to ensure that support is given to those who report and give evidence. It is important that witnesses and those who give evidence feel safe about doing so if the perpetrators are to be brought to justice.In June 2004 COAG approved a national framework on Indigenous family violence and child protection and agreed that further work would proceed through bilateral agreements between the Australian government and each jurisdiction. Whilst this has produced some useful outcomes, many important issues remain. I would urge each of the premiers and chief ministers to attend the summit. I say again that the federal government stands ready to assist them in the business of policing and law enforcement. Can I indicate, I hope on behalf of both sides of this parliament, that the people of Australia would want us to take a strong stand in relation to safety in Aboriginal communities, and this government will ensure that we do.</DOC>

 - I thoroughly support the policy which this government has announced in relation to offshore processing of people who make asylum claims in relation to Australia. What that means is that people who get to mainland Australia will be processed offshore in exactly the same way that people who arrive on offshore islands do, including islands such as Christmas Island. I may have missed it, but I thought the Labor Party had supported that policy as well. There was the flip and the flop of the Leader of the Opposition, but as I recall it, in relation to islands such as Christmas Island, the Leader of the Opposition, in a previous incarnation, supported that. - There is no need to debate it. Between his flips and his flops he actually voted to excise offshore islands from the Australian immigration zone. He supported the Pacific solution in relation to Nauru. - As I said earlier, in relation to mainland Australia the same provisions will apply. Australia will deal with those claims at third-party processing centres. That is the appropriate way to deal with these things. We will comply with the UN convention on refugees and, in addition, our government will ensure, as we always have done, that Australia has a strong and secure border protection policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The member for Leichhardt knows the Indigenous communities up in the cape and the Torres Strait. He advocates for them and wants to see a better future for them. With the recent media attention, he is no doubt aware, as everyone in this place is, that the use of what some people have described as 'customary practices' or 'cultural practices' as a defence is totally unacceptable in modern Australia. These are not cultural practices; if they have been, they have no role to play in 2006.The Acting Prime Minister has written today to the premiers and chief ministers. He has outlined in that letter that this is a key issue that we collectively as a nation can deal with. We can ensure that all Australians are treated equally under the law and that no group can use 'cultural significance' as a defence and thereby get a lesser penalty for the rape of a 14-year-old girl. - There is an interjection from the other side that the High Court has dealt with this issue. I am referring to a 14-year-old girl who was raped for two days. The offender received a one-month sentence in the Northern Territory. When the sentence was appealed, the perpetrator of that crime received three years, suspended after 18 months. I do not believe that any Aboriginal Australian or any other Australian would believe that is an acceptable penalty for that crime. - That is unacceptable, I say to the member for Sydney. The Prime Minister has said:_ I have the strongest possible view that every citizen of this country, whatever their ethnicity, is entitled to the protection of Australian law but is also subject to Australian law in all its dispensations and I do not believe in any shape or form in the application of customary law by our courts or anywhere in this country. - What I have asked for is that we come together as a nation to acknowledge that the major reason people find it impossible to report crime is that they know what the outcome will be.I have not had the chance to inform the Acting Prime Minister yet - but I am able to do so now and, in doing so, to inform the House - that the Northern Territory has today informed me that its police minister and attorney-general will be attending the summit. That is a very positive thing. I spoke last night to the South Australian Indigenous affairs minister, who was also very positive and intends to attend the summit - as does the New South Wales minister. -  - I remind those members from the opposition who continue to interject that law and order and the criminal justice systems have always been the responsibility of the states and territories. The Howard government are saying, 'We are going to stand by you and we are going to assist Australian men and women no matter who they are or where they live.' We are putting partisan politics aside. We are putting aside the issue of states and territories. I am very saddened by the attitude of some who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - In the very first meeting I had in Darwin with the Chief Minister, she highlighted to me the sad plight of the people in Alice Springs. I did not go back to my department and say, 'Let's consider this'; I said to her on the spot, 'I will assist you. Our department and government will assist you and work with the Northern Territory' -  - If you wouldn't mind, you might just learn something. At that meeting I made a commitment that we would do so. The reason I was back in Alice Springs some two to three weeks later or shortly thereafter was not to give hollow promises but to deliver on a commitment to fundamentally change the way the town camps - the itinerant population that comes in -  - What we committed to there was not one centre. We committed to doing the following: first of all, upgrading what people refer to as the town camps, which all of us would understand to be suburbs which are run by Indigenous people rather than the municipal council. -  - $20 million, I inform the honourable member, so that power, water, sewerage and rubbish collection could be brought up to scratch. Over the next two years -  -  - Mr Speaker, I wonder why it is that this upsets the Labor Party so. We also undertook to establish additional hostels and additional dry-out centres, to address the sad plight of people who are picked up by the night patrols, picked up by the police, who are taken to the one centre at the moment, given a shower, a bed for the night, clean clothes and sent on their way the next day and who then repeat the cycle - so that they will have somewhere to go where they can have real interventions to change their lives. I have been back a second time in order to try and secure the land to do that.That is not all we are doing. We have also put into place in Mutujulu funding for a police station so that law and order can be delivered - real resources into real communities. We also promised last week to provide additional resources to the intelligence desk between Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory to get to the perpetrators of crime so that fewer people are subject to the abuse you are referring to. - Furthermore, we have put a sniffer dog team into Darwin -  - and now we commit a further one to Alice Springs to get to the root and branch cause of these problems: substance abuse. We are going to the cause of the problem, not simply dealing with the symptoms, as governments of all persuasions with goodwill have done far too much of in the past, while dealing with the problem far too little. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I indicate to him and the House that this government is committed to occupational health and safety, but those opposite continue to make false claims about the availability of occupational health and safety training after Work Choices. For the record: can unions conduct occupational health and safety training since the introduction of Work Choices? The answer is yes. Will occupational health and safety training continue after the introduction of Work Choices? The answer is yes.Yesterday we had the AWU boss, Bill Shorten, on Sky News. He was repeatedly making misleading claims about occupational health and safety. He had a question from David Speers, who asked Mr Shorten, 'Do you accept that workers at this mine or any other workplace will still be able to receive union provided safety training under the laws?' to which Mr Shorten replied, 'No, I don't accept that.' This is simply wrong. What Mr Shorten says is simply not true. He is wrong about that - that is, either he is totally ignorant of the laws that operate in Australia or he is being deliberately misleading about the effect of those laws.How can the unions and the Labor Party possibly object to us saying that occupational health and safety clauses must be about occupational health and safety? How can they object to that? We are saying that those clauses should not be about other union training which has nothing to do with occupational health and safety. Take this example of union training which is being promoted by the union movement at the present time, by the ACTU, with a flyer around to workplaces in Australia encouraging members to take three days off work in order to attend an activists course in Sydney. This is the sort of thing which does not pertain to the employment relationship. We are simply saying that occupational health and safety clauses ought to be about occupational health and safety, not a range of other things like this and the sort of abuse that has occurred in the past.The reality is this: over the last couple of months, nearly eight weeks, of operation of the Work Choices legislation, the Employment Advocate has had lodged with him agreements - collective agreements and others - which provide for occupational health and safety training, and those agreements have been vetted as being okay by the Employment Advocate.That is the reality. Clauses relating to occupational health and safety have been contained in agreements that have been lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate. So workers like the miners in Beaconsfield, who went off to a training course at an operation in Lithgow in New South Wales, partly owned by the CFMEU, are able to continue to do that. Nothing whatsoever in Work Choices changes that. That is what the member for Perth conceded in his doorstop yesterday. That indeed is the advice that came from the office of the member for Lilley, having consulted with the member for Perth about whether or not employers could continue to send employees off to training courses. I will repeat this once again: the answer that came, via the member for Lilley from the member for Perth, was yes, an employer can send employees to union training.</DOC>

 - The question is one of the location of family relationship centres and why they are in one place and not another. Here is my answer: why didn't we just leave the family relationship centres in all the places where the Labor Party had placed them between 1983 and 1996? There weren't any! There was not a single family relationship centre in a single electorate between 1983 and 1996. Here we have the Labor Party saying: 'You've introduced 65; there aren't enough around Australia. Look at our record: we had none'! The opposition gets worse by the minute.Let me go to the question of Aboriginal disadvantage. As the Minister for FaCSIA said a moment ago, when you are dealing with crime of the levels that you are in Aboriginal communities, family relationship centres, which deal with marital breakdown, are not the front-line services that you need. The front-line services that you need are a police force that is capable of apprehending those who are engaged in crime, a court system that will try them and a jail system that will punish them. - Let me conclude by saying what the government did announce in relation to Indigenous affairs. It was much greater than any family relationship centre: a $3.3 billion expenditure; 24 new measures, totalling $372.9 million -  - The family relationship centres -  - So 65 new family relationship centres have been established by this government -  - the first and the only government to ever establish a family relationship centre. That is in addition to what we have done in relation to Indigenous affairs: a $3.3 billion allocation for Indigenous affairs, for things that Indigenous people really need, such as health, housing and most of all law and order. The suggestion that you can confront those problems through family relationship centres is wrong. Indigenous people deserve a lot more than family relationship centres. They deserve front-line services in law and order, health and education, which is what this government is developing.</DOC>

 - First of all, let me say this in terms of Australia fulfilling its international obligations on climate change: today the national greenhouse accounts were published and they show that Australia is on track to meet the target that was set for Australia under the Kyoto protocol. What is interesting is that the statistics show that, in the period from 1990 to 2004, Australia reduced its emissions per capita by 12.7 per cent. On the measure of emissions per dollar of GDP, Australia has improved by 35.2 per cent. That highlights the fact that this government is taking seriously the need for Australia to contribute to the issue of greenhouse mitigation.More generally, the Australian government is taking a very practical international approach to this issue. The AP6 initiative - bringing together Australia, China, the US, Japan, South Korea and India, which constitutes around half the world's population and economy in emissions - has had an initial series of working group meetings in the United States and is making good progress. It is making such good progress that countries like the United Kingdom; more broadly, the European Union; and, most recently, during the Prime Minister's visit, Canada, have been showing a real interest in this initiative. Canada, I understand, may have some interest in joining it.It simply illustrates that the view around the world - if not everywhere in this country - is that new thinking is needed, new technologies are needed and all forms of energy need to be considered. For example, the amount of nuclear energy worldwide produced from Australia's uranium exports saves in the amount of carbon emissions the equivalent of all of the emissions Australia generates every year. In other words, it could at least be argued that our uranium exports already effectively neutralise Australia's global emissions contribution. There is no doubt that Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle, through our uranium exports, is a useful contribution to addressing the issue of climate change.This stands in stark contrast to the opposition's position on these issues, which is to say that it rejects nuclear technology and thinks that the future rests entirely in renewables. We on this side of the House agree with the broader view in the international community that there is a role for renewables. But, to put that into some perspective, it has been estimated that you would need a wind farm occupying 3,200 square kilometres to produce the equivalent energy of a medium sized power station. Some perspective needs to be kept about what can be achieved with renewables. I heard the member for Kingsford Smith on the radio this morning being interviewed by the redoubtable Fran Kelly. - Somebody over there on the Labor side says it was a good interview. I listened to it with interest, and it was the usual line from the Labor Party. The member for Kingsford Smith said, 'I don't think nuclear is good for us.' He said he had not changed his position since he was a candidate for the Nuclear Disarmament Party 22 years ago. My only point here is that it does stand in some contrast to what the honourable member said when he spoke to the Sydney Institute on 6 April last year. He called for an open debate on the issue of nuclear energy and said that such a debate would be welcomed. This change of heart does suggest that he is following the party line. It does remind me of the words of a well-known song by a well-known band:Short memory, must have a short memory.</DOC>

 - In this budget we increased the low-income tax offset to $600. The low-income tax offset is applied by the Taxation Office automatically. It is automatically done once you put in your return, so you do not have to calculate it. The employer, who does not have the knowledge of what your taxable income will be through the year and cannot calculate it, does not have to calculate it. For most Australians, it is a very welcome return when they put in their tax return. This is the system which has been operating for many years. It has been made more generous. There has been no change. It is not exclusive to women. It applies to men, to women, to anybody who is eligible for the low-income tax offset. It works very well and it has just been increased.I think most Australians are actually warming to the budget. As I go around Australia, I find that most Australians are very interested in income tax cuts. They know that superannuation has been a massive punch-through, and they know it is only this government that can deliver economic outcomes which are important to them, to their children, to their mortgages, to their businesses and to their planning for the future. It is only the Liberal and National parties that can be trusted with economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and her interest in child care. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its child-care survey on 22 May 2006. The publication is released every three years. What this showed was that the proportion of the population accessing child care in 2005 was 22.6 per cent, compared to 14.4 per cent using formal care in 1996. That is basically a 50 per cent increase in the proportion of families that are now accessing child care.The second thing that the ABS found was that, after taking into account the child-care benefit, the costs of child care - the median cost of formal child care in Australia, after you have got your benefit - was $31 per week. Thirdly, what it found was that, even though the number accessing child care had risen from 14.4 per cent to 22.6 per cent, the number that were unable to access child care had actually fallen. There were 106,100 children requiring additional formal care, down from 123,200 when the Australian Labor Party was running the child-care system. Further than that, the average amount of additional child care required was less than one day a week under the ABS. So here we have a child-care system which has more people accessing it than ever before -  - and which, before the introduction of the rebate has a median cost of $31 per week and, thirdly, which has reduced the number of people that are looking for additional child care. - All of this comes together to be the largest investment -  - in child care that Australia has ever had and, although more people are accessing it all the time, the number of people that are still looking for child care has declined.That does not mean that there cannot be improvements, and the uncapping of outside school hours places and the uncapping of family day care will improve the child-care system in Australia. The introduction of the child-care rebate, which will give you a 30 per cent rebate of your out-of-pocket costs, will also improve the situation for mothers. This is a government which is determined to improve child care for working mothers in Australia. What the ABS publication shows is that, over the last 10 years, we have made improvements, we are making progress and our budget announcements will take that further.</DOC>

 - That would depend on whether the financial institutions which have borrowed it - Westpac, CBA and ANZ, principally, and National Australia Bank - have entered into fixed or variable borrowings. But let me ask you this: by how much will it increase the government's interest payments? Zero - not a single dollar. Why? Because the government does not pay interest any more.When this government was elected, the Australian government had $96 billion of Labor Party debt. It was costing us $8.4 billion to service Australian Labor Party debt. Because of the economic management of the last 10 years, in net terms we have now wiped out Labor Party debt. We have reduced our interest payments by $8 billion. That means that the Australian government has now freed itself from the economic waste and recklessness -  - The answer is: the interest bill has not increased for the Australian government because we have freed it from Labor Party debt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for the question. As I mentioned to the House yesterday, the Australian government is engaging in an ambitious plan to upgrade Australian roads and, in particular, to upgrade the Bruce Highway to four-lane standard at a cost of some $1 billion. Planning has been under way for this major upgrade now for 18 months or so in cooperation with the Queensland government and half-a-dozen routes have been identified for consideration for the new corridor for this road.The honourable member asked me whether there are any alternative policies. There is one, and that comes from the Queensland government, who have been partners in developing these corridor strategies. Their alternative policy, announced last week, is to build a dam to flood nine kilometres of the road. Their policy is to flood the road that we are proposing to upgrade. - The Queensland government has been actively involved in the development of an appropriate corridor for the new route. It has produced this wonderful magazine with the Queensland government's logo on the top of it. Included in it are the series of routes, which have been opened for public consultation, for the Bruce Highway. What I find interesting is that none of these routes has got a big blue blob over it to demonstrate what is going to be flooded. - Queensland seems to be proposing a road for submarines rather than for cars. What we have here is a government on the run, trying to sabotage an important Queensland development aimed at ensuring that there is adequate transport movement up and down the Queensland coast.Needless to say, the constituents of the member for Fairfax - and my own - are very angry about this proposal. There have been numerous public meetings, including one addressed by the member for Fairfax, where thousands of people have demonstrated their disgust that this proposal has been dumped on them without any warning or notice. Six local mayors have all indicated that they regard this proposal as completely unacceptable, commenting particularly on the lack of information and lack of studies into the feasibility of the dam and its impact.But it is not just the local people who are angry. It is not just those whose farms will be flooded and whose roads will be submerged. It is not just those people whose livelihoods will be destroyed. A very interesting letter has just come to my hands from Dr Ivan Molloy. He was quite a well-known character at the last federal election - well known to members opposite in the worst possible sense - but he also happens to be the husband of the member for Noosa, Cate Molloy, representing one of the areas supposed to be advantaged by this dam proposal. Dr Molloy has written:This ill-judged decision, with such disastrous environmental and social consequences and undertaken without any semblance of community consultation, indicates either the state government is in pre-election crisis or is arrogant and out of touch. ... Either scenario is not healthy.Queenslanders know a fair bit about not being healthy. But here we have the Labor Party, as well, recognising that this Beattie dam proposal - or damn Beattie proposal, as most of the locals refer to it - is an environmental disaster. It will significantly interfere with the infrastructure of the region. It is a proposal that the Beattie government should put to death immediately.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and indicate that I have had lots of representations on this matter. The member for Gwydir has been very, very active as a local member in relation to this, and I pay tribute to him for all of the wonderful work he does on behalf of people up near the Namoi.Whether a sum is characterised as a capital sum or income depends on the application of case law. If it is characterised as a capital sum under the authorities, then you are eligible for this government's discount rate on a capital gain. If it is characterised as a capital sum, it can be set off against capital losses. Whether that is advantageous or not will depend on a particular person's taxation arrangements. If it is income - that is, if it is genuinely income - then it follows that it will be assessed as income under the Income Tax Assessment Act.We are looking at this very carefully. This is a matter for the application of the law and the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner of Taxation will make his decision. If there is anything arising out of that that warrants further action, then the government will carefully consider that and we will let the public know.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. As the Acting Prime Minister said earlier in question time, this government has a very proud record on border protection. There is no more important task for the government than the protection and security of Australia and indeed of its borders.The government's efforts in relation to illegal people smuggling stand as testimony to the success that the government has had in that area. But as far as foreign fishing and illegal fishing are concerned, I can inform the House that in the budget recently the government committed another $389 million over the next four years for a range of initiatives. They will include a long-range helicopter capability and increased surveillance and intelligence activities; there will also be a commercial ship which will be available for the processing of apprehended vessels. There will be crematoria for the burning of apprehended vessels - foreign fishing vessels. They will also include additional processing facilities at Weipa and Gove and an expansion at Broome.In addition to that, $96 million will be invested in bringing into operation two Huon class minehunters with rigid hull rapid inflatable vessels to move from them to apprehend foreign fishing vessels. The Australian government currently has in action Armidale patrol boats in the northern waters, supported by PC3 Orion surveillance and Customs air crews. Recently, I spent a day and a night on HMAS Bathurst, and last week the Acting Prime Minister himself visited one of our patrol boats.There is no more important task being undertaken by the Royal Australian Navy than the protection of Australian waters, particularly from foreign fishing. The task that is being undertaken by our sailors is as important as it is dangerous. The House should be aware, for example, of what happened with HMAS Geelong some months ago. A boarding party was seeking to board a foreign fishing vessel. The crew, in seeking to board that vessel, were seriously threatened. Not only were very large, sharp spears put out from the side of the vessel as it sought to evade being apprehended, but missiles were thrown at the boarding party and one member of HMAS Geelong was left hanging on the stern of the fast-moving vessel.On behalf of the Australian people, I thank and commend members of the Royal Australian Navy for what they are doing. I am currently looking at the graduated level of response that our naval vessels can undertake. I will inform the House of that outcome. I also welcome to the parliament the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council.</DOC>

 - The skill training visas system was developed in response to representation from regional industries - and that is why it was developed - many of whom had difficulty filling apprenticeship vacancies. Before an overseas apprentice can fill a vacancy, an approved regional certifying body must certify that no Australian apprentice can be found to fill the vacancy and draw on documentary evidence that must be provided by the potential sponsor. All regional certifying bodies are endorsed by relevant state and government bodies, and in some states the certifying body is the state government. For example, in South Australia, it is the South Australian state department that is the certifying body, and I am led to believe that in nearly all the states the state governments reserve unto themselves to be certifying bodies. Those certifying bodies must certify that no Australian apprentice can be found. I do not believe there is any evidence whatsoever that the regional certifying bodies have done that falsely and I doubt whether the opposition would say that they are doing it falsely, because they are in fact state governments and bodies -  - 'So what?' the member for Throsby says. The member for Throsby does not accept the New South Wales government? No. She does not accept the South Australia government? No. She does not accept the Victorian government? She does; she is nodding. My goodness! Perhaps the member for Throsby will advise a vote against the New South Wales Labor government at the next election and a vote against the South Australian Labor government at the next election. From our point of view, they are regional certifying bodies. Can I make this point: no position can be filled by a foreign apprentice unless there is certification and documentary evidence that a local apprentice cannot be found. That means that they will not be taking positions from local apprentices, the numbers of which have massively increased under this government.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question. The government remains concerned about the situation in East Timor. There was a brief respite from the unrest following the conclusion of the congress of the ruling party, Fretilin, between 17 and 19 May. But reports that we got yesterday and that we have been getting today are that parts of Dili and other parts of the country are descending into violence, and there are reports of injury and property damage. There is a report that an Australian journalist with SBS has been caught up in this violence, and our ambassador and embassy are doing what they can to evacuate him from the area of concern. This resurgence of violence underscores the importance of the independent commission which has been established by the East Timorese government to investigate the grievances of the 595 dismissed soldiers. We would urge that the commission conclude its work quickly as a first step to the resolution of the current crisis, though there are other underlying issues behind the crisis. We encourage all parties to resolve their differences in a manner consistent with the rule of law, with democracy and with international norms of human rights. Rebel military and security personnel must cease destabilising the situation and work with the government to resolve their differences.I have remained in close contact with my East Timorese counterpart, Jose Ramos Horta, and obviously with our ambassador and staff in Dili. We have made it clear that we are ready to offer assistance to East Timor if needed and if requested by the East Timorese government directly or indirectly through the United Nations. As I think the House is aware, we have prepositioned some military assets in Northern Australia, including naval vessels, aircraft and even some troops, to enable a rapid response to assist with evacuation or some other form of assistance if it is required.I will conclude by saying that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises Australians to reconsider plans to travel to East Timor at this time because of the ongoing violence and the potential for further violence and advises Australians in East Timor who are concerned about their safety to consider departing. East Timor is a young country and, being a young country, it is inevitably coming to terms with the responsibilities of democracy and government. I hope that this difficult situation can be resolved quickly and, obviously, peacefully. Australia stands willing and ready to help to bring about a return to stability if that help is needed at any time.</DOC>

 - Obviously, I do not know what has been said to that particular company, but I can say that independent contractors have long been a feature of the Australian workplace. It is not as if this is something new. It is not as if independent contractors just appeared after the Work Choices legislation was passed.Independent contractors have a very valuable place and role to play in the Australian economy. Let me give an example. The domestic house-building industry in Australia is probably the most efficient in the world. It runs almost entirely on independent contractors. A brickie comes in and does the brickwork, a chippie comes in and does the carpentry and a tiler comes in and does the tiling work. It works for the house-building industry and it works for the contractors. It has given Australia one of the best systems in the world. It existed before Work Choices. Independent contractors add enormously to the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - Last year the government implemented the antiterrorism act and it included the offence of urging the use of force or violence against other groups of people in Australia - and I might say that measure was enacted despite the best efforts of the Labor Party to have it removed. As I have said before in relation to these matters, if the law needs to be further strengthened, that is what we will do. I have asked my department for some advice on that matter, in the light of some recent material about which it has been said that the measures that we enacted would not enable those publications to be dealt with. But one thing is clear: if the opposition had its way, there would be no laws dealing with this important issue in Australia today. The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber. 
 - This happened despite the fact that the Labor Party took every step that it could. At that time, the shadow minister for homeland affairs said:... we will be pressing ahead in the Senate with our proposals to remove the sedition laws from this legislation ...Now, five months later, it appears that Labor has had a change of heart, because the shadow Attorney, speaking to Steve Price in Sydney last week on radio, had this to say:If you cross the line of encouraging others to commit acts of violence, you should be able to say that that is unlawful. That's inciting violence and it should be contrary to our laws.This is precisely what the government acted on last year, and the Labor Party ran a dishonest scare campaign in relation to that matter. This is another example of the Labor Party wanting to walk both sides of the street when they test the political waters.</DOC>

 - The Minister for Trade did have a very successful trip to Iraq. A consequence of that trip was that the Iraqi Grains Board, which had indicated that it would not deal with AWB Ltd, indicated that it would deal with an alternative supplier, Australian Wheat. The Iraqi Grains Board has been dealing with Australian Wheat, which includes companies such as the Barley Board, CBH and other suppliers.Whether or not a commercial contract comes off is a question for commercial negotiation. It depends on price, it depends on volume and it depends on terms and conditions. Unfortunately, parties cannot always agree. But the success of the trade minister's trip was that he ensured that Australian Wheat got back in the door; it got back into those negotiations and those negotiations have taken place. I want to pay tribute to the trade minister for doing that and for his bravery in going to Iraq and to acknowledge the wonderful work that he did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, and also for her tireless efforts on behalf of her constituents. I am pleased to inform the House that as part of the magnificent budget that was brought down recently in this place by the Acting Prime Minister, councils around Australia will receive some $307.5 million extra in Roads to Recovery funding. This makes a total of $615 million this current financial year for the 700 local government authorities around Australia. The Roads to Recovery program, introduced by this government, is now worth some $2 billion to the more than 700 councils around Australia over the next four years. It was of course welcomed by all councils around Australia and by the Australian Local Government Association president, Paul Bell. In his press release of 9 May 2006, he said:This is what nation building is all about - investing in infrastructure that is essential to every Australian community _On top of this, the Australian government is providing $1,676 million in financial assistance grants over this current financial year. Instead of falsely claiming that local government receives nothing from this budget, those who sit opposite should be encouraging their state Labor mates to stop ripping money out of local councils and to follow the federal government's lead in providing additional resources for those local councils to provide services for their communities.</DOC>

 - Contact between Australia and East Timor has been between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the foreign minister of East Timor, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will no doubt update the House and the nation on that later on. What I can advise is that the situation in East Timor remains dangerous, that there was continued fighting overnight and that the situation could change quickly and without notice. The travel advisory has been updated and, as a consequence, we are now warning Australians that if they are already in East Timor they should consider departing. I can also indicate that those Commonwealth government people who are non-essential are doing that, and arrangements are being put in place for Australians to protect their safety.Can I indicate as well that Australia stands ready, if requested by the constitutional authorities in East Timor, to provide security to assist in stabilising the situation. I make it clear that this would be done in relation to a request - and it would have to be a constitutional request. Australia has an interest in having a stable region. We would respond to a request not only because it is in the interests of the East Timorese people but also because it is in the interests of Australia that the area be stabilised. Australia has already contributed both policing and troops to East Timor, and we stand ready to assist our neighbours if they should request assistance again. Relevant elements of the Australian Defence Force have been placed on a footing where they would be able to respond on very short notice indeed. Our objective, of course, would be not only to secure the situation in East Timor but, in addition to that, to defend the personal safety of Australians. This matter has been extensively discussed with the heads of security and Australian defence forces. The National Security Committee had a long discussion in relation to it yesterday, and it will continue to monitor developments and deal with them as they arise.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. Let me just say, as the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer has just said, that the current security situation in East Timor is one we would describe as dangerous. I have received reports from our embassy in Dili this morning of further outbreaks of fighting between government forces and an opposition group near a place called Tasi Tolu, which is on the outskirts of Dili and very close to the headquarters of the East Timorese military forces. As the Acting Prime Minister has said, we have reissued our travel advice as well.Of course, I have been in constant contact with my counterpart Jose Ramos Horta over the last few weeks in relation to this matter. I spoke to him just before question time and I also spoke to him last night. The point I have always made in my conversations with him is that we urge all parties to show restraint and respect for the rule of law and the constitution of East Timor in resolving the current crisis. We have had some discussions in the last 24 hours about the question of whether the international community, including Australia, would provide any kind of assistance, be it police assistance or military assistance, to East Timor, and there will be some further discussions during the course of this afternoon, including with our ambassador, with President Xanana Gusmao.I have made the point, and the government have made the point, that we are ready to assist East Timor but that that would require a formal request from the government of East Timor - and by a formal request I mean a letter signed by the President, the Prime Minister and, preferably, the Speaker of the parliament, but, most importantly, by both the President and the Prime Minister. In the event of a request of that formal nature being received, I have told Mr Ramos Horta that Australia could consider several options for assistance. We do have troops pre-positioned, as the Acting Prime Minister has said, and they are ready to be deployed quickly, either to assist in evacuation or, possibly, to help to stabilise the situation in Dili. We also have some police whom we can deploy quite quickly if required. We could indeed, as I have told the foreign minister, send a combination of the two.We would await further contact from the East Timorese government during the course of this afternoon. We have not at this stage received a formal request, but we have had some discussions about this issue and about the terms under which assistance could be provided. We have also had some discussions about what other countries could do to assist, because it is likely that if East Timor does send out a formal request to Australia it will send formal requests to a small number of other countries as well. It is also important that the United Nations be notified and kept informed of all this. There is a special representative for the Secretary-General, Mr Hasegawa, who is based in Dili, who is being kept informed by officials, by the East Timorese and by New York. It is important that the secretariat of the UN is kept informed, along with the permanent members of the Security Council. I made the point to Jose Ramos Horta that, in particular, the five permanent members of the Security Council need to be kept in touch in relation to the evolution of East Timorese thinking.</DOC>

 - We would certainly welcome bipartisan agreement from the Australian Labor Party on the measures that are necessary to deal with violence in Aboriginal communities. The measures which are necessary include additional policing; they include bringing offenders before courts; they include ensuring that there are proper penalties; and they include a very clear and very direct message to all Australians, including Indigenous Australians, that there is no justification - no cultural justification and no other justification - for offences against persons. We would certainly welcome the assistance of the Northern Territory Labor government in ensuring that adequate police resources are made available in relation to those communities. - This is where we would welcome bipartisan support, which I do not hear from the interjections now coming from the Leader of the Opposition. Whatever he says, it is clear that the people behind him do not agree with that position and are not supporting the government in those efforts. I would make it clear that this government called a summit to put those matters back on the agenda. - A national summit, the call for which was made by the minister for Indigenous affairs, will be held next month - I have written to all premiers and chief ministers - and it is to get agreement on these points: to make sure that we are strong, tough and clear about stopping violence in Aboriginal communities. It will be reporting back to COAG and COAG will be involved in the procedure. Let there be no mistake about this: this government believes very strongly in protecting innocent children and women in Aboriginal communities and we will not let political correctness get in the way of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and I can tell him that there are calls for customary law to be taken into account to reduce punishment for serious and violent offences. Even the Law Council of Australia came out yesterday calling for Aboriginal customary law to be given consideration by courts and saying that proposals to exclude that were 'misconceived, dangerous and promoted the issue ahead of more demanding social problems'. We do not agree with that. We believe that there can be no more demanding social problem than the protection of innocence, particularly of children in Aboriginal communities or, for that matter, in the white community.I noticed in the paper today that the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, Brian Martin, said that he had made a mistake in sentencing an Aboriginal elder to just one month's jail for having anal sex with a 14-year-old girl. I welcome that from the Northern Territory Chief Justice. It would not have been easy for him to do, but it was absolutely right of him to acknowledge that. That matter was overturned in the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal, which imposed a sentence of three years in relation to that crime.Many Australians would believe that a sentence of three years for having anal sex with a 14-year-old girl and bashing her with a boomerang was still a very lenient sentence. Many Australians would think that. Many Australians would think that even that sentence by the Court of Criminal Appeal was not much of a deterrent. I would make this clear: if we are to send an unequivocal sentence to the Aboriginal community - and the white community, for that matter - that these are violent offences that will not be tolerated, we need strong support from the judiciary with strong sentences. A suggestion that cultural matters should be taken into account to lighten sentences on what are violent and serious offences will not find the support of the Australian people. We believe that there should be an unequivocal message.In raising this issue, an issue which has now been acknowledged by the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory himself, the minister for Indigenous affairs has behaved quite courageously and properly. I notice that the Attorney-General in Western Australia has accused Mr Brough of bigotry over his statement. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a courageous way, he has raised this issue; he has determined to do something about it. He is now finding support from the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory himself. He will find the support of Australians of goodwill. We can never justify, under customary law or on any other basis, heinous and serious and violent offences. Those who do them must be brought to justice, and this government believes that they should be.</DOC>

 - On this side of the House, we welcome a debate about the nuclear industry. On this side of the House, we have no hang-up at all about exploiting Australia's resources to gain export income for this country. It is the Labor Party that says, 'It's okay to mine uranium in three places, but wrong to mine it in a fourth or a fifth.' I have no higher authority for the inconsistency of Labor's policy than the next Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who said - listen to this -  - The day will come when he will be unable to silence Bill Shorten any further. Let us hear Bill Shorten's views now._ I propose to apply a commonsense approach to these issues. I expect questions to be specific, and answers to be relevant.An answer must be relevant to the question.That is, not connected to the question, not partially relevant, but relevant. - This government has no hang-ups about exploiting Australia's natural resources -  - and exporting to countries that comply with -  - nuclear safeguards. As Bill Shorten has said:Federal Labor has a three mines uranium policy and the way which we get around that is we call every new mine part of an existing mine.You can only have three, but they can have multiple subbranches all over Australia. It sounds like a Labor Party branch stack to me! Three branches with multiple subbranches all over Australia. - We welcome this debate. We think it is in Australia's national interest, and we will take great pleasure in seeing Bill Shorten lead the Labor Party again in relation to this very important issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He no doubt would have seen the report in the paper the other day from the Labor Lord Mayor of Townsville, who has asked not to be forgotten with regard to policing issues in dealing with the Indigenous community of Townsville. I am only too aware of the work that the member for Herbert is doing with the people of Palm Island, a troubled community and one that wants to do far better and understands the importance of real policing. I have been heartened by the fact that so many people from around the country are recognising the absolute necessity of ensuring that Aboriginal communities have the same rights as the rest of us - that is, to live in a free society that is free of violence - and that they have security in their own homes.Today Magistrate Sue Gordon, who is Chairman of the National Indigenous Council, had this to say:First and foremost, we have children who are being abused and the first priority ... is protection of children.Maxine Schute, from the Alice Springs women's shelter, a woman that comes in contact every day with the consequences of a breakdown in law and order, was reported to have said:We have to look at a system where the perpetrators of these crimes are removed and not left in the community to spread fear, to intimidate those who have been strong enough to speak out.Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, says:This type of behaviour has no place in Aboriginal culture and customary law ...And we agree with him. He says it:... is no excuse to condone such behaviour. If an Indigenous person commits these types of offences they should be dealt with by the judicial system just as any other person would be.The reality is that these communities have no faith in the judicial system because the perpetrators often, whilst on remand, get returned to these communities and that is where the fear and standover tactics come into play. It puts the fear of God into these people that if they stand up in a court of law and say what they know to put these perpetrators behind bars they will have payback. This is what has failed these people; this is what we are determined, once and for all, to deal with.Today I have spoken with a number of Indigenous people right around Australia, outlining the way I see this moving forward. I want to highlight comments from two different individuals. The co-principle of the Daly River School, which is not far from Wadeye, is very concerned that the violence that has been occurring in Wadeye and with the dry season now coming will spill back out of Wadeye and into these other communities. He wants us to be aware of that. She says that there has been a lid on this for too long, that the people have had no voice and now they have hope. She says that people are hurting and they hope that they get the support they need. The support they need, first and foremost, are police on the ground so that crime can be reported and crime can be dealt with. It beggars belief that members opposite shake their heads saying that that is not the answer. Live in a community where your child cannot be safe because there are no police. I ask you to consider such consequences. - Finally, in speaking to one of these women today, who in fact I should not identify for obvious reasons -  - It responds to some of the interjections that came across earlier to deal with housing. This woman has been in the field for 12 years working with family violence in remote communities. She said to me: 'I want Australia to understand that this is not an issue about housing. I strongly reject the notion that it is about housing. - I am listening to people who are actually on the ground, who actually understand domestic violence. Let me tell you what a woman that deals with the consequences every single day says - not what the ALP says. She says that most of the abuse happens privately behind closed doors. She says, 'It is especially a problem in remote homeland communities where overcrowding is not a problem.' This government does not for one minute suggest that housing is adequate. We say that it is not an excuse to rape a child. We will continue to say that and we will continue to support these communities. Thankfully, Labor state governments today are willing to work with us. -  - </DOC>

 - As I said earlier, the government believes that it is an important debate for Australia to have as to the nuclear industry. This government already has a policy which allows Australian uranium to be mined and exported. The Australian Labor Party supports that in three places. It would be a funny kind of a policy if Australia was prepared to mine uranium and to sell it to other countries but was so opposed to the nuclear industry that it would not allow it in Australia. What the Prime Minister has said is that this is a debate that Australia should have. It is a debate which will be an important debate for the future. I would urge all members to engage themselves in this debate. Those on this side of the House, who believe in Australia and its economic future, will certainly be engaging in a positive debate over the months to come.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Boothby. I appreciate his interest in participating in a debate about these issues, which I would hope in this country we could conduct in a sensible way. In answer to the honourable member's question, there are a lot of countries around the world, including countries which export uranium, countries which have nuclear technology and countries that have nuclear power stations, that have been able to conduct a debate and a discussion about these things in a very sensible and mature way.In relation to countries in our own region, Japan has 55 nuclear reactors providing 30 per cent of its electricity, three under construction and 12 planned. China has 10 with plans for 40 by 2020. There are six in Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea - South Korea - has 20. Indonesia has plans for four reactors to be built in the period 2017 to 2025, and Vietnam and Thailand are studying the possibilities of nuclear power as well. So I just make the point that there are a lot of countries that think that nuclear power is a real option for generating electricity, at least as a component of their energy mix, and they have been able to have a reasonably mature discussion about this and the value of it.Talking of alternative views, I noticed in a press release that the Leader of the Opposition put out on 23 May, yesterday, in relation to his opposition to anything the government even chooses to talk about - he just opposes everything, which is I think taking opposition to an absurd extreme - in this case, opposing discussions about nuclear energy, he said:... there are important national security issues to be considered.I wondered, I must say, reading that, what it meant. This morning in a doorstop the Leader of the Opposition said:Nations tend to regard those developing nuclear power for the purposes of power generation as retaining options for weaponising it.Apparently, according to the Leader of the Opposition, countries like Japan, Vietnam and Thailand should be considered countries which are planning to weaponise nuclear power to build a nuclear weapons capability. The Leader of the Opposition pretends to be - and has sold this message quite hard up there in the press gallery - an expert on national security, foreign policy and defence issues. I call him a charlatan. He is a charlatan on these issues. He is unfamiliar with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and he knows nothing about the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime and nothing about the important role a country like Australia can play not in endangering the world but in securing nuclear power generation through our nuclear safeguards agreements. I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition ought to brush up on his so-called expertise in international relations.</DOC>

 - Needless to say, long experience in this place has led me to believe I will never take an assertion from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this or anything. But can I say that the government's Work Choices legislation enables employees to come to agreements with employers which suit both of them, with terms that are protected by the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. Those standards protect important matters and ensure that there is a floor under wage negotiations. They do not stand in the way -  - of people ensuring that they come to mutually bona fide agreements which are in the interests of both employers and employees. One of the things that this country has needed for years is the opportunity to have a more flexible labour market. Under a more flexible labour market Australia will have more jobs and they will be higher paid. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We need only look at the outcomes. Since this government was elected in 1996 there have been 1.7 million new jobs created in Australia. Since this government was elected in 1996 real wages have increased 16.7 per cent. Under 13 years of Labor government real wages increased 0.3 per cent. One of the proudest boasts of the Labor Party was how they depressed real wages. I can remember Mr Keating standing at this box boasting over and over again that Labor had suppressed real wages. - The coalition boast is that under a coalition government real wages have gone up and under a better industrial relations system people will get better job outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. In October last year the government coordinated Exercise Eleusis, which simulated an outbreak of avian influenza. It brought together industry, a hospital and state governments to assist our preparedness in the event of an actual outbreak. I am delighted to be able to release the government's final report on Exercise Eleusis, which evaluates the exercise and makes recommendations on how we can do even better in the future. I commend it to all members of the House as a new and original document. Just bear in mind those words, 'new and original'.I am asked about alternative policies. A keen and enthusiastic member of my department told me the other day that there was an impressive and creditable paper issued on avian influenza from the opposition side - namely, by the member for Griffith, who, as we know, has many interests. I did not know pathogenic disease was one of them, but he prides himself above all else on being an original thinker. So I accessed his document, which is published by the Labor Party on Labor eHerald, which is the ALP's national online magazine. -  - It is on avian influenza and I am asked about alternative policies. So I start reading it and at first glance it does look incredibly scientific and creditable, but somehow the words begin to sound familiar. The more I read it, the more I realise that these are phrases that have been brought to my attention previously. These marked paragraphs will be of great interest to the House. So what I find is that, of a 600-word policy, 400 words are plagiarised. -  - Two-thirds of this document comes from five different international surveys.The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - So the words had a familiar ring, and I find when I research the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States that there are several sentences and paragraphs contained in the honourable member's paper. - The first influence on the Labor Party's policy was an American centre for disease control. The next one was the World Health Organisation. The next one is the Parliamentary Library. The next one is WWF Hong Kong and - wait for it - they have plagiarised the minister for health's own website. Just to add insult to injury, they plagiarised Tony Abbott! - So in the Labor Party document there are no footnotes, there is no attribution and there is no notation. The original thinker, the member for Griffith, is parading other people's work as his own. Bill Shorten would not do it. No, Bill would not do that. And, worse still, this is quite deliberate, because different sentences are cut and pasted with other sentences, and paragraphs from the five different sources are mixed up. There is a deliberate deception in the drafting of this document. This is no accident. This is not taking information from one source and making it a whole slab; it is all cut and pasted by this supposedly original thinker. So it is deliberate plagiarism. The only thing worse than having no Labor policy is having a plagiarised Labor policy, and I table all of the documents for members to reach their own judgments.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. It was a pleasure to be in her electorate last week to look at some of the projects that are under way as a result of the Australian government's investment through AusLink in important rail and road infrastructure upgrades. In particular, I was able to witness the signing of a new $16 million contract to provide a new rail bridge over the river at Wagga Wagga, replacing the old 1881 steel structure with a modern concrete facility that will enable the speed limit of 20 kilometres per hour to be lifted as the trains cross the river and inevitably slow down the movement of freight between our capital cities.We were also able to visit the Hume Highway and look at some of the projects in line for the $800 million investment by this government announced in AusLink for the Hume Highway, bringing to $1.4 billion the AusLink commitment to upgrade the Hume Highway to four lanes. When I was there, there was obviously a great deal of enthusiasm for this expenditure, but there was also a degree of frustration because the money that the Australian government has been providing to New South Wales for the Hume Highway in the past simply is not being spent. Particularly the people around the Coolac bypass project are especially angry that a long time - years, in fact - after the Australian government made the commitment to fund this important 12-kilometre bypass the work has not started.In fact, the tenders for that project closed on 11 May 2005 - a year and two weeks ago - and New South Wales to this day still have not decided on the successful tenderer. In fact, the whole process is caught up in New South Wales heritage legislation - red, green and black tape! They say to us that it will be at least the end of the year before they will be able to consider the issuing of a contract for this project. How many more people have to die on this road before the New South Wales government will get on with the job of spending the money that the Australian government has already provided them? There is an absolute degree of incompetence in the management of New South Wales that is delaying projects that could be delivering an improved road system to Australians, and it is time they got on with the job.</DOC>

 - The Australian government's Work Choices legislation is based on enabling employers and employees to come to agreements which are in their mutual interests and which are above and beyond the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. What that means is that there is a floor under terms and conditions and, above that floor, employers and employees can negotiate for the advantage of both.Can I point this out: employees are in a stronger position today than they have been in for at least 30 years, because unemployment is lower today than it has been for the last 30 years. The proof is in the government's performance. This is a government under which there has been massive job creation. This is a government under which there have been real wage increases. The worst thing that could ever happen for Australian employees is the return of a Labor government. -  - Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I know how concerned he is to ensure that public hospitals in Queensland at least are being well managed. I can assure him that the federal government is certainly providing ample funding to state public hospitals. Under the current health care agreements we are providing some $42 billion for state run public hospitals. That is a $10 billion increase on the previous five-year period. While we are providing half the money for state public hospitals, we do not play any role in their administration. To the extent that there are problems in our public hospital system, it has very little to do with money and much more to do with consistently poor management.I can inform the House that the Commonwealth is giving some $14 billion to New South Wales public hospitals, yet in New South Wales public hospitals operations are being cancelled because of leaky roofs. Local charities are being forced to pay for their own thermometers, linen and baby scales. Surgeons at the Royal North Shore hospital in Sydney have been ordered by management to recycle old drills. Waiting lists for elective surgery are 3,000 people longer now than they were 10 years ago. According to today's Daily Telegraph, the New South Wales health minister is incapable of placing a timely order for a new wheelchair for a terminally ill child.We are giving some $10 billion to Victoria under the health care agreement. Despite that, some 600 heart operations have been cancelled in the last 12 months in Victorian public hospitals. We are giving $8 billion to Queensland, yet in the last two years no fewer than 1,600 doctors have resigned from Queensland public hospitals because they cannot stand these places as places of work. They are only keeping the emergency department at Caboolture Hospital open by privatising it.There are a great many problems with the administration of public hospitals in the several states. But, as if running these public hospitals was not hard enough, I can inform the House that administrators in Victoria and Queensland have just discovered a new priority: banning bibles. In Victoria and Queensland, Gideons have now been banned from placing bibles at every hospital bedside, even though this practice has been going on for some five decades. A Royal Melbourne Hospital spokesman was quoted the other day as saying: 'We don't have bibles in each room anymore. It is an infection control measure.' Presumably, the Royal Melbourne Hospital thinks that we should be sworn in in this place in surgical masks and gowns because of the risk of infected bibles. This is not an infection control measure - it is a thought control measure; it is political correctness gone crazy. I say to public hospital administrators in this state: stop worrying about offending people and start running public hospitals properly and give people bibles at a time when they probably most want to see them.</DOC>

 - No, I do not accept for a moment the proposition that is put forward by the honourable member. As I said earlier, under the government's industrial relations reforms we have the Australian Fair Pay Commission standard and we have the opportunity for employers and employees to come to agreements. It will be a system which is in the interests of employers and employees. This government stands for 1.7 million jobs, unlike the Labor Party. This government stands for real wages and real wage increases, unlike the Labor Party. We know that the member for Perth has been instructed by the trade union movement to lift his game.

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and for his nine years of loyal service to the Royal Australian Air Force. We were all aware of the outbreak of violence in the Solomon Islands on 18 April and then across to 19 April. I think, like all Australians, we were particularly impressed with the very rapid response of the Australian Defence Force, which deployed within 24 hours 110 fully equipped and armed soldiers to Honiara to - along with other countries - bring stability to the Solomon Islands. Over the past month, we have had deployed from the Australian Defence Force as many as 400 Australian Defence Force personnel, which has included two companies of infantry, headquarters support, two Iroquois helicopters and two patrol boats, along with the airfield defence guards.The national security committee considered Australia's ongoing commitment to the Solomon Islands in terms of defence and peacekeeping in support of RAMSI late yesterday, and I can inform the House that we will commence very shortly a withdrawal of a number of our Defence Force elements and continue over the next two weeks. We will continue to have deployed in the Solomon Islands a company of around 140, and they will be supported by elements from the New Zealand Defence Force and Pacific island nations - which is currently Fiji. We will continue to closely monitor the peaceful nature of the Solomon Islands and will review that on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis.All Australians should and can be very proud of the work that is being done by the Australian Defence Force under the leadership of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston in this deployment. The 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment will be remaining there for the foreseeable future and the Australian Defence Force will also be contributing to the guarding of the Rove prison, which is very important to the continuing security of the Solomon Islands.</DOC>

 - Long experience in this place has told me not to rely on an assertion or an allegation from a member of the Labor Party, and I do not accept whatever proposition or allegation that he puts forward. If he legitimately believes that an agreement has been entered into which undercuts the Australian fair pay and conditions standards, he could report that. But, of course, he does not decide to do that.Employees in Australia at the moment are in the strongest position they have been in for 30 years because we have had 1.7 million new jobs. They have the highest wages that we have ever had in Australian history, because under this government wages have gone up by 16 per cent. The only thing that could represent a threat to either your job or a wage increase in Australia would be the re-election of the Labor Party. The Labor Party loved the unemployed so much that it created hundreds of thousands of new ones! I say to people: in a growing economy with a better industrial relations system, their opportunities will be much greater.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I say to her and to other members of the House who have applauded the government's announcement in the recent budget that superannuation now has much greater appeal to younger people in particular in this country. It is a much more understandable system. And we say to people who are over the age of 60 that, from 1 July next year, they have no tax to pay on a pension or on money which is drawn down in a lump sum. It provides an opportunity for us to say to young people who are in their 30s and 40s to consider superannuation in a way they have not been able to in the past. Superannuation is now a less complex system that provides greater opportunity and savings incentives and will provide very well in the future for generations who will be experiencing the ageing of the population. - For the benefit of the member for Brisbane, who interrupts and who, like the members opposite, does not support the way in which we have said that we will reform superannuation, I will explain to him that it will provide tremendous support -  - Order! The member for Brisbane does not need to encourage it. - from 1 July next year to people over the age of 60. It will reduce complexity. We say to them that we will support them in retirement as we never have before. But there is one important point to make out of all of this, and that is that the Labor Party still have not committed themselves to this change. Despite having had two weeks since this announcement, we still have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition as to whether or not he agrees with or supports this change. This is another opportunity for the Australian people to see how the Leader of the Opposition is weak and undecided on these issues.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question is no, I cannot say that I have read the report by Professor Dobson or whoever it is that makes all of those claims. The answer to the last question is also no, because ministers who make responsible decisions and take into account all of the issues that need to be properly weighted cannot be held responsible for the sorts of outcomes that the honourable member referred to. If there is some further information that the minister for the environment would like to provide, I will give him that opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing that needs to be said to those who are understandably concerned about the privatisation of the Snowy is that it was inevitable from the moment New South Wales put its 58 per cent share up for sale. However, the Australian government is confident that the change in ownership of Snowy Hydro Ltd will not impact on the security of entitlements for irrigators. The Snowy water licence, issued by New South Wales but negotiated by three governments, has guarantees of continuing releases at current levels for irrigators. That responsibility is not altered in any way through a change of ownership.Some irrigators have expressed concern that New South Wales might seek - understandably, given its track record - some changes to the terms of the licence at some point in the future. The Commonwealth took that on board. We considered it and, as a result, the governments have built in a massive disincentive for that to happen. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement has been amended so that, if New South Wales were to seek to reduce allocations to irrigators, the cut would come out of its own allocation of water from the scheme in the future. No government, now or in the future, could afford to do that economically, let alone politically.Another step the Commonwealth has taken to protect entitlements is to limit any individual shareholding to 10 per cent. In addition, two-thirds of Snowy Hydro directors must be Australian citizens and any proposals for foreign investment will be subject to foreign investment guidelines. Whatever the ownership, with the 10 per cent limit the terms of the Snowy water licence and the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement provide a bedrock of security. The government believes the process of approving the sale undertaken by the parliament through a motion of both chambers is the right one.</DOC>

 - I do not pretend to have seen the actual statement that she has made, but what I would say to her, to the Leader of the Opposition and to everybody who is interested in this issue is simply this: at the end of the day the test of workplace relations laws is the contribution they make to the general health of the economy. If workplace relations laws strengthen the economy, they generate more jobs. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when he presided over 11 per cent unemployment in Australia, we had the most highly regulated labour market this country has had in the last 40 years. All the regulation in the world did not save people in the Beazley employment ministry era from losing their jobs.When it comes to taking advice from Labor leaders on employment matters, I have always preferred the view of my good friend the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Tony Blair, who, when addressing the Trades Union Congress in 1997, said, 'Ladies and gentlemen' - I do not think he said 'comrades'; I think he said 'ladies and gentlemen' - 'fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' I have no doubt that the workplace relations laws of the Howard government will lead to more jobs, higher wages and a stronger economy.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Cook and I appreciate his interest. Let me say that the security situation as of last we have heard in Dili is bad. We are very concerned about the security situation on the ground and there are reports of shootings, so there is a good deal of danger there. Of course, our first priority is to the welfare of the 800 Australians who are in East Timor, and we continue to advise those Australians who are there that they should leave and that Australians who are considering going to East Timor as civilians should not do so.I have directed that the non-essential Australian government staff and their dependants should depart as quickly as possible. Although the last I heard the civil airport was open and there have been scheduled civilian flights over the last few days, the government is arranging a C130 flight to assist the departure of Australians as necessary and that flight is expected to leave sometime this afternoon or possibly this evening.As far as diplomacy is concerned, I think honourable members will be aware that I have had many conversations with my friend and counterpart Jose Ramos-Horta over the last few days. He, of course, has been a very constructive interlocutor in putting together this assistance that Australia is providing.I know a number of honourable members will be interested in the role of the United Nations in all of this. Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Hill, has spoken to the United Nations Secretary-General's chief of staff - Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, is currently I think on a trip to Vietnam - and he has written to the Secretary-General and the current President of the Security Council informing them of East Timor's request for assistance. The Secretary-General has also been notified by New Zealand and Portugal. The current President of the United Nations Security Council released a media statement a short time ago which said, amongst other things:The members of the Council - being the Security Council - expressed their full understanding of the request, and appreciated the initial favourable responses made so far by the Governments concerned.That, if you like, informal statement by the President of the Security Council is likely to be followed up, probably this evening our time, by a formal presidential statement that is being drafted and negotiated at the moment. I have spoken this morning with the American Secretary of State, Condi Rice. The Americans are giving a good deal of assistance to ensure that this presidential statement is made. So insofar as there are concerns about how the United Nations fits in to what is happening and what we are doing, I think that is proceeding satisfactorily.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and his championship of the defence community in Townsville. I also take the opportunity to welcome to the House the midshipmen from the Royal Australian Naval College, HMAS Creswell, and thank them for committing their lives to the service of Australia and the Royal Australian Navy. 
Honourable members - Hear, hear! - The government has three objectives in terms of the defence and security of Australia. It is firstly about defending and securing our borders; secondly, about security in our region - as the Prime Minister said, instability in our region means instability for Australia; thirdly, to recognise that what happens in remote parts of the world has everything to do with the security of our country in this the 21st century.The Australian Defence Force of 51,000 personnel is undertaking at the moment a wide range of activities across that broad global theatre. Recently we saw 400 ADF personnel assisting Australians with Operation Larry Assist. Two and a half thousand supported security at the Commonwealth Games. Every day there are 300 ADF personnel defending our borders with naval and air assets from everything from illegal fishing through to those who seek to come to Australia unlawfully. In our region more recently I think all Australians were impressed by the very rapid response to the Solomon Islands and the events which happened on 19 April. I announced yesterday that, with security and stability having been returned to the Solomon Islands, Australia will wind down its current deployment from 370 to 150.Today, as the Prime Minister has said, the Australian Defence Force is doing it again. Having had two weeks of pre-positioning, today, subject to the agreement of the East Timorese government, we will deploy around 1,300 ADF personnel. We do not do that lightly. We know that this is going to be a particularly dangerous mission, but we know that it is important for the people of East Timor, the stability of our region and the security of Australia that we play a significant and lead role in ensuring security in East Timor. As the foreign minister said, the situation in East Timor is very unstable, it is very dangerous and there are also incidents occurring as the day progresses which give no reason to believe that it is likely to improve in the foreseeable future. Equally, the commitments the government has made in Afghanistan and Iraq in supporting democracy and overcoming terrorism have everything to do with what happens in Australia.We are able to undertake these tasks because the government has made a significant financial commitment to improving the size and structure of the ADF. We have taken the proportion of ADF personnel that are combat ready from 42 per cent to 62 per cent. The government has also committed over the next 10 years, which will bring the total to 15 years, a three per cent real increase in funding above and beyond inflation. Should the East Timor deployment fully proceed, we will have around 3½ thousand ADF personnel deployed from a Defence Force of some 51,000. If we were asked to assist with humanitarian or other kinds of issues - whether in our own country or in our region - I can assure you we have much more in our back pocket. The government has well-advanced strategic planning for the future of the ADF.</DOC>

 - As the member for Perth will know, I made it very clear when the legislation was introduced that in relation to the conditions of employment there were those that were stipulated as part of the Australian standard. They related to hourly rates of pay, to annual leave and to all the other things that were listed in that standard. On issues such as penalty rates I indicated that, if people were covered by an award, then the award provisions would apply. In relation to other matters such as employment under an AWA, the question of whether penalty rates would apply would be a matter that had to be specifically addressed. If those issues were not specifically addressed, then the default position would be the adoption of the provisions under the relevant award in relation to matters such as penalty rates. It remains the case that, if the lady mentioned in the honourable gentleman's question believes she was terminated because she did not sign an AWA, she can make a complaint to the Office of Workplace Services.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and for his ongoing interest in this subject. Last month there were reports in the media that workers on a building site in Melbourne were docked four hours pay after they stopped work to take a collection for the widow of a deceased colleague. At the time, it was claimed by the union concerned, the CFMEU, that this had occurred due to Work Choices. This matter was investigated by the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner who, after his investigation, issued a determination on the matter.What the commissioner found about this case was interesting. He found that the CFMEU site representative and the CFMEU organiser had both attempted to manoeuvre the employer, Hooker Cockram, and other contractors into a position where they were obliged to deduct four hours pay. He found that the CFMEU site representative engaged in unlawful industrial action and that the CFMEU organiser aided and abetted the contravention by this representative - in other words, this report of the Building and Construction Commissioner found that the CFMEU had shamelessly manipulated the workers concerned. That is what an independent report found. -  - It is interesting that they do not want to hear. They want to be part of the allegations, but they make as much noise as possible so as not to hear what an independent inquiry found. This is what the ABCC found:One of the purposes for taking the action appears to have been to gain publicity for the CFMEU's views about the new work choice relations laws.What we have here is the CFMEU being prepared to use the workplace death of a colleague to pull a political stunt, something which is appalling but not surprising. It is not surprising because the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, said last year: 'I need a mum or a dad of someone who has been seriously injured or killed for my campaign. That would be fantastic.' That was an appalling statement. We now have another appalling incident. - I do not think it could be put better than what Neil Mitchell, the morning presenter on Radio 3AW, said this morning:Do not trust the CFMEU. If you are a member of that union, wake up to yourself. They claim concern about workers killed on the job, and then they use their bodies and their families to play politics.He concluded in his comment:It is sickening.Instead of the interjections we get from the Leader of the Opposition and others opposite they ought to join me and the government in condemning this absolutely pathetic stunt.</DOC>

 - The answer to that is no. The situation is, as I said last year - and the government was totally open about it when the legislation was brought forward - that, with matters relating to penalty rates, if somebody is covered by an award, the award provision obtains. If somebody is not covered by an award, it must be specifically addressed. In the absence of it being specifically addressed then the default provision applies, and that default provision represents the terms and conditions that are in the award.The Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues can ask, as they undoubtedly will, as many questions as they choose on this issue and indeed on any other issue. But nothing can alter the fact that, when we changed the workplace relations laws 10 years ago, they said unemployment would go up, wages would go down, people would be humiliated, people would be sacked, their lives would be destroyed, their families would be destitute, their marriages would break down, they would resort to violence against their friends, they would become unsociable and they would become enemies of society. Ten years on, do we have those situations in Australia? No. Ten years on, we have real wages that have gone up by 16 per cent, versus a lousy 1.3 per cent under the former government. We have seen unemployment at a 30-year low, and we have seen international economic bodies say that the wages and remuneration of production workers in this country compared with the rest of the world are second to none.I have said it before and I will say it again: my guarantee to the workers of Australia is my record. My record over the last 10 years is of service to the workers of Australia, service that the Labor Party could only dream of giving to those men and women of our country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can tell him that yesterday the ABS released its Measures of Australia's Progress, which looks at where Australia was 10 years ago and where it has come over the last 10 years. I think members on both sides of the House will welcome the fact that, over the last 10 years, national income in Australia has substantially increased. Between 1994-95 and 2004-05, national disposable income per capita grew around three per cent per year, an important measure of the strength of the economy.The good news is that national disposable income grew for all sectors of society, including the lowest paid. Importantly, real average disposable income grew for all Australian households by 21 per cent, but for lower income households it grew by 22 per cent over the last 10 years. So, over the last 10 years, it is true to say that the rich got richer and it is true to say that the poor got richer too, which I think most members of this House would believe in.On average, real net worth per capita increased 0.9 per cent a year between 1995 and 2000. Our housing improved, our productivity kicked up, our life expectancy increased, our education and training increased, with more Australians becoming educated, and the unemployment rate continued to decline.That made me think I ought to take my mind back to 1994-95 - a trip down memory lane. In 1994-95, we had a famous publication released by the then Minister for Finance, a publication called Shaping the Nation, about the achievements of the Labor government. In this section on the economy - have a listen to this - this is what he reported in 1994-95: 'The Labor government has transformed the economy with low interest rates, low inflation and a huge growth in employment.' 'Low interest rates' is what the then Minister for Finance claimed Australia had in 1994-95. Do you know how low they were? Ten and a half per cent. Boy, I'm glad they weren't high! He also had a 'huge growth in employment'. Unemployment was at 8.3 per cent in 1994-95.You have two documents: one from the ABS and one from the former Minister for Finance. They tell the story and they tell it eloquently: you cannot trust Labor with economic management.</DOC>

 - Let me give my answer in two parts. Firstly, our legislation is not absurd, unfair and unreasonable. Our legislation will be as successful in generating more jobs for the Australian economy as was our legislation of 10 years ago. The doomsaying of those who sit opposite about our legislation will be proved just as invalid as it was in relation to our reforms of 10 years ago.In relation to what I said on the Alan Jones program, no disrespect to the person who has asked the question - perhaps it is some of the company she keeps - but I have learnt from long experience -  - I mean amongst your colleagues. I respect the lady very much, Mr Speaker - she is a hardworking member and I mean no offence to her. But I have long adopted the very wise practice, when members of the opposition get up and say, 'You said this 10 or 20 years ago' or '15 months ago' or '15 days ago,' and I take the normal human precaution, of having a look at the transcript before I accept what is put to me by the opposition. I intend to do that again on this occasion, much as I respect and like the member who asked me the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his continuing interest in the maritime industry. As the member for an electorate that produces a lot of exports, he wants a very efficient maritime sector and, particularly, efficient Australian ports. I am pleased today to report to the House on the conclusion of a major chapter in Australia's waterfront reform. You will all be aware that, in the time of this government, we have transformed Australia's waterfront from one of international embarrassment to one where many of our ports are at or up with world's best practice.We can all remember on this side those days when Labor ministers stood at this box and told us that it was completely impossible to move more than 14 containers an hour - it simply was not possible to move more than 14 containers in an hour. Now we regularly achieve double that figure. Indeed, our export and import performance has been greatly enhanced.A levy was introduced in 1998 to help fund the waterfront reform agenda, in particular to fund redundancies that were occurring as part of the waterfront reform. There has been $247 million collected through that levy and it has funded, amongst other things, redundancy packages for 1,487 employees. - When this levy was introduced it was indicated that the expectation was that it would take until 2010 for the cost of this redundancy package and the reform to be funded. I am pleased to inform the House today that the levy will be lifted from the end of this month - four years ahead of schedule. The job has been done, the funds have been collected and this package of reforms has been completed.I acknowledge and thank the members of the Maritime Industry Finance Co. for their effective stewardship of this program. I particularly acknowledge the work of our former colleague Peter Reith, who led this reform process and put in place the mechanisms which our country is now benefiting from richly. We have had substantial reform on the waterfront, and that reform process is now at an advanced stage. There is still more work to be done, and I acknowledge the work of the member for Gwydir, as Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and others who played key roles in driving this agenda. We copped endless criticism from the other side of the House. They are silent now. They recognise as well that our waterfront is a much better place, we have achieved a lot of reform and our country is the richer for it.</DOC>

 - I will choose to answer it, Mr Speaker. I will take the opportunity of repeating what I said earlier - that is, that the reforms that we have introduced to the workplace relations law are going to result in more jobs, higher living standards, higher wages and a stronger Australian economy. I invite the opposition to go on asking these specific questions as long as they like, just as they did in 1996, 1997 and 1998. My friend and colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has just reminded me that, when we introduced the reforms to the Australian waterfront, we were told by those who sit opposite -  - No, Mr Speaker, I have not finished my answer. - When we introduced those reforms in 1998 the opposition railed against them. They defended the outrageous practices of the Maritime Union of Australia. They predicted that the Australian waterfront would not become more efficient. Eight years later we have hourly crane rates on the Australian waterfront that are the envy of the rest of the world. Just as they said the world would come to an end -  - No. I will just wind up on this point. I am warming to my task! The minister for agriculture reminds me that they said over there -  - They said it was physically impossible to achieve crane rates of 22 an hour. They are now at 27 an hour. There is a working rule on industrial relations debate in this chamber: never believe those who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I regret to inform the House that over the past few months the half-century-old practice of placing Bibles by hospital bedsides has ceased in large numbers of public hospitals in Queensland and Victoria. I quote again a spokesman from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Victoria. He said they did not have Bibles in each room anymore:Because we have so many people from different religious backgrounds it is considered inappropriate. It is also an infection-control measure.I am not for a second saying that director-generals or health ministers in those states are responsible for the Bible ban. I would be quite confident that the Bible ban is the result of overzealous local officials terrified of appearing culturally insensitive. For that reason, I would respectfully refer any such officials to a very intelligent letter from Mr Michael Choi, who is the Labor member for Capalaba in the Queensland state parliament. The letter appeared yesterday in a Queensland local paper. It read:Tens of thousands of patients find the bedside bible a source of comfort, particularly in times of difficulty, and their families often use it when they visit them.He went on:I have been an active participant of the multicultural communities in the last 20 years and not once have I heard complaints about people's freedom of religion being violated in hospitals and offence taken because of bedside bibles. - Michael Choi, the Labor member, goes on:This is exactly the type of issue that gives multiculturalism a bad name. - He goes on:I would have thought visitors brought more germs to the hospital on their hands, their clothing and their shoes, as they walked past numerous patients, not to mention numerous magazines and newspapers available at some hospitals.I agree with Michael Choi, the state Labor member for Capalaba. This Bible ban is objectionable and should be withdrawn. It would take only a few words from the Victorian and the Queensland health ministers to overturn this ban. I respectfully suggest that they utter those few words. They should allow Bibles back to the bedside and they should allow this worthy, traditional practice to continue.</DOC>

I am aware that a number of people, including one in particular for whom I have some affection - a good colleague of mine, who represents the state of New South Wales - and others, have voiced some reservations. Let me do my best. In doing this, I do not think I get things wrong in saying that this legislation passed the House without opposition from the Australian Labor Party. -  - You have not joined the Australian Labor Party, have you? I mean no offence to the member for Calare. - I thought I said 'without opposition'. You are correct: it was a motion. I do not think they voted against it - am I right? -  - They supported it; okay. I know that is not of any account in a sense but I am trying to make my point, Mr Speaker. Let me explain to the House - and this is a serious issue, and I treat the -  - I note, Mr Speaker, that the Labor Party is trying to stop me giving a respectful answer to an Independent member. We have decided to sell our 13 per cent stake in Snowy Hydro for three main reasons. The first is that the Commonwealth holds a minority 13 per cent and we have accepted that the New South Wales government decided in December of last year to proceed with the sale whether or not the Commonwealth chose to participate.The second and very important reason, we are selling is that we are very confident that the sale will not affect water flows for irrigation and the environment in any way, and let me tell the House why. Firstly, Snowy Hydro does not own any water itself; the public owns that water. All Snowy Hydro has is a licence issued by New South Wales that permits them to make use of the water. That licence is locked in for 75 years through legislation and agreements that New South Wales has signed with other governments. That licence is the instrument that obligates Snowy Hydro to make guaranteed minimum annual releases to the River Murray into the Murrumbidgee, and the sale will not change that obligation in any way nor will it change our commitment to making environmental releases down the Snowy River.As for the arrangements we have had with Snowy Hydro and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, can I remind the House of the budget subvention of some $500 million along the way to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Those arrangements, put in place since the sale was announced, will mean that the commission and New South Wales and Victorian water agencies will have more information and more certainty on the timing of releases for irrigation.The third reason why we support the sale is that we believe that the private sector is best at running businesses, not government, and we are instructed by long years of experience in relation to that. Our responsibility is to make certain that the regulatory regime protects the stakeholders. I remind the House and I remind the member for Calare that much of Snowy Hydro's infrastructure is now 40 or more years old and privatising the company will give it access to new capital and it can reinvest in and upgrade its clean, green energy business. And I think that is a very good result for the environment, a good result for electricity consumers and a very good result for the region.I understand the concerns that have been expressed and I acknowledge that this is probably an issue where, on the surface, a majority of public opinion would oppose what is being done by the three governments. But that is what I think, for the reasons that I have outlined to the House and for other reasons, and I would be very happy to further explore them with the member for Calare and indeed any member of the House who has concerns. And the concerns that others have in this parliament have been put to me and I have a feeling they will be put to me very forcefully within the next few days and in no uncertain terms, but, as always, I will listen to those and I will respond as best I can. But for the reasons I have outlined, I think the government has taken the right decision. I am not persuaded that the legal position is quite as ambiguous as that represented in some newspaper articles this morning, particularly on the front page of the Financial Review. I think the legal basis of what we are doing is pretty sound and I am not disposed and the government is not disposed to change our position.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and can report to the House that some 15,300 people in years 11 and 12 are engaged in school based apprenticeships. In fact, over half of them are in the state of Queensland alone. The government believes very strongly in school based apprenticeships as being part of the way in which we can engage not only the young people of Australia and the education and training communities but also, importantly, the business community to understand the investment that they should make in their business through training people.Of course the record level of expenditure in our most recent budget and the budget of last year includes a commitment of some $25.9 million, in an initiative to Group Training Australia, to help foster 7,000 more school based apprenticeship opportunities and, on top of that, the $343.6 million Australian technical colleges initiative will deliver another 7,500 school based apprenticeship opportunities. In fact, I noticed the South Australian education minister was in the Adelaide Advertiser today boasting how that state has in fact trebled school based apprenticeships - of course as a result of the initiatives of this government.The member for Dobell comes from the state of New South Wales and in that state there are no school based apprenticeships in the form of certificate III in the trades. Let me be very clear about that. While a state like Queensland has some 2½ thousand young people involved in school based apprenticeships in the trades at certificate III level and above, in the state of New South Wales - and indeed in the state of Western Australia - because of the opposition of the CFMEU and other unions, this is not possible. The Prime Minister, just two weeks ago, wrote to the premiers of both of those states, asking them to keep their word to the COAG conference earlier this year, and indeed to the education ministers of each of those states to the training agreements they signed in October of last year. I would call on them to remove all of the impediments which continue to stand in the way of school based apprenticeships at certificate III level and above.It is preposterous to think that - in a week when the New South Wales government tried to trick the people of New South Wales with an $18 million announcement which is about giving 36 days' work experience to students attending just 10 schools, in the face of the fact that the Australian technical college proposal, which will provide over $100 million of funding in eight schools and 100 days of work experience and training to those young people - we have some 10,000 young people in New South Wales today denied an opportunity to do a school based apprenticeship at certificate III and above.This government will continue to demand action, particularly from New South Wales and Western Australia. The question those opposite have got to ask themselves is: where do they stand, and why is it that they back the ambitions and views of the leaders of unions like the CFMEU, leaders like Andrew Ferguson and Kevin Reynolds, instead of backing the ambitions of young people, particularly in the state of New South Wales.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and his strong interest in the resources sector. The news on Australia's resources sector just keeps getting better and better, with the latest figures showing that exports of iron ore have now reached $11 billion in 2005, earning the Western Australian government some $1 billion in royalties and representing some eight per cent of Australia's total merchandise exports. Of course, iron ore is not the only commodity that our trading partners are chasing. We are seeing real global demand grow by the day for our uranium. With 40 per cent of the world's low-cost uranium here in Australia, we have a real opportunity to build our export performance.This is an opportunity going begging, because of Labor's 'no new mines' policy and the fact that Western Australia and Queensland will not allow the development of a uranium industry in those states. This is a policy described by various people as 'illogical', 'anticompetitive' and 'silly' - and they are just the people in the Labor Party.Meanwhile, we are seeing the Leader of the Opposition grappling with the policy on uranium and trying to walk both sides of the street. While he is giving indications that he will reconsider his uranium policy and allow the resource to be exported and used in nuclear power plants overseas, he will not allow a debate here in Australia on nuclear power. That is despite comments from his own side - such as those from the member for Batman who, earlier this year, called for cool heads on the nuclear industry, saying 'it may well become essential for our future global, environmental and energy security'. He is backed up by my friend the member for Hunter, who says, 'Look, I'm not as fearful of nuclear power generation as some people are; I mean, most of Europe use it.' Even the new member for Werriwa is keen to get in on this and he said, 'If we can export uranium and are satisfied that it is only going to be used for power generation and not weapons proliferation, then why aren't we doing the same?'The Leader of the Opposition wants to sit there and deny his own party and Australians the opportunity to debate nuclear power. The last word should go to the member for Batman who, on the weekend said, 'Anybody who says there is not a debate about it' - nuclear power - 'is just plain stupid.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. People's personal arrangements or company arrangements with regard to their tax matters are entirely a matter for the Commissioner of Taxation. This parliament operates independently. The Commissioner of Taxation runs the Australian Taxation Office, which is an independent statutory authority. They will make investigations and, if people have acted outside of the law, then those people will incur the penalties that are provided for in the legislation. The laws in this country are very clear in relation to prohibiting such payments that are made to bribes. This is a very deceptive question by the member opposite, and I would say -  -  - that what needs to be respected in this process is that the matter is before the Commissioner for Taxation at the moment. The way in which he deals with it, the penalties which he may apply, are entirely a matter for him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and acknowledge the considerable support that she provides to constituents in her electorate, both men and women, who are keen to save for their future, who are keen to put more money away into their superannuation policy.One of the most significant policies - one of the most successful policies - of the Howard government has been the superannuation co-contribution scheme. Since this scheme came into place, the Australian taxpayer has provided $1.8 billion towards people's superannuation in the form of co-contribution payments. Importantly, that is, of course, of considerable assistance to all Australians, and to women in particular. I say to the House today that there are over 84,103 women in the period of January to March of this year who have had $76.7 million paid directly by the Howard government through the co-contribution into their superannuation funds.The question is: how is this government helping people into retirement? We have an ageing population in this country. We need to make sure that we provide support to people into their retirement. This is one of the ways in which we are helping people. It is one of the ways in which we will secure the future of this nation. It is 16 days since the federal budget was handed down - and still not one word of support from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the superannuation system that we have announced as part of the budget. It is a budget measure which will provide simplicity for people under the age of 60. It will say to people over the age of 60 that we will do away with the end tax that they pay; we will make it easier for people over the age of 60. From 1 July next year we will make it much simpler. We will take the complication out of the system. You would think that the alternative Prime Minister of this country would support such a system - not a word.</DOC>

 - Mine safety training is something which ought to be not only allowable but a matter of course in this country. My understanding is that mine safety training and matters of mine safety are governed by state law. It is also my understanding that, under the present law, any accredited safety provider can provide that training. It is also my understanding that there have been agreements entered into under the new law which allow for the safety training of people including attending courses provided by unions who are accredited trainers.</DOC>

 - The member for Bass will be aware that this afternoon there will be an opportunity for all of us to pay tribute to all of those involved in this remarkable event and also, of course, to temper that with our sadness at the loss of one of the miners, Larry Knight. More specifically, I can inform the House of a number of initiatives that the government will undertake in relation to the Beaconsfield community and also this particular event. The government proposes to contribute a sum of $8 million to a Beaconsfield community fund, the trustees of which will be representatives of the federal government and the local council. If, as I would expect to be the case, the Tasmanian government joins the federal government in making a contribution to this fund, there would also be a representative of the Tasmanian government. So there would, in that eventuality, be three trustees.This structural adjustment fund has some precedence in relation to the response of the federal and state governments to the closure of the steelworks in Newcastle some years ago and also to the various iterations of closures or scaling down of activities by Mitsubishi in South Australia. I would hope that this fund would be drawn upon to provide some continuity of employment until the future of the mine is known. That, of course, is in addition to any other entitlements to which people affected by any prolonged closure of the mine may be entitled.It is also the government's intention to invest a sum of $1 million in a fund that will provide income of approximately, I am told, $70,000 a year to fund a Larry Knight memorial scholarship in mining engineering at the University of Tasmania. This proposal has been discussed with the family of the late Mr Knight and they have expressed their approval. We believe that this is a more practical and effective ongoing way of marking his life in mining and also the sad and tragic circumstances of his death.Finally, the House will be aware that the Australian Workers Union has established a fund. I have indicated that, subject to the completion of the formalities, any contributions to that fund would enjoy tax deductibility. It is also the disposition of the government itself, after the details of the objects of the fund and so forth have been processed and made known to us, to make a contribution to the Australian Workers Union fund.I believe that these three measures are an appropriate response to this situation. They do recognise the extraordinary dependence of the Beaconsfield community on this mine. They also recognise that the most practical way of remembering the late Larry Knight is to have a scholarship bearing his name in mining engineering at the University of Tasmania. There is also a recognition of the commitment of the Australian Workers Union to providing assistance to the Knight family not only by tax deductibility but by an appropriate contribution by the federal government.</DOC>

 - In answer to the question from the member for Perth, it is quite clear in the Work Choices legislation. If he would like to go to section 16(3) of the Work Choices legislation, he will find out - if he has not already looked - that that quite clearly and explicitly preserves state and territory occupational health and safety laws and, as part of that, it quite explicitly preserves the right of union officials to have entry for occupational health and safety reasons. - In addition to that, as the Prime Minister indicated in his answer to an earlier question, there have been agreements lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate over the last seven or eight weeks since the introduction of Work Choices on 27 March which contain provisions relating to training for occupational health and safety. If you take the Tasmanian situation, nothing has changed in relation to the provision of occupational health and safety. Under the Tasmanian legislation, which provides obligations on the part of mine owners and others in Tasmania to provide training and instruction in health and safety, one of the authorised trainers is Unions Tasmania, and there are therefore provisions whereby workers in Tasmania can continue to receive that training.It is not as if the opposition does not know this because, in the email from a constituent of the member for Lilley, which had been previously referred to for advice from their workplace relations spokesman, Mr Smith, this was said: 'An employer can send employees to union training. Yes, that is correct.' This was in writing from the member for Lilley, having obtained advice from the member for Perth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and for his interest. As the House knows, Australian troops are re-establishing security and the rule of law in East Timor. As law and order returns, it is going to be vital for the East Timorese political leaders to establish a dialogue with each other to address the deep-seated problems that the country is facing and for that dialogue to occur within the constitution of East Timor. I understand that there are two key constitutional councils which are chaired by President Xanana Gusmao which are meeting today. I hope that those councils prove to be successful in at least beginning the process of addressing differences that exist. Quite clearly, the armed forces and the police must cease conflict between the two and within the two. There are signs that that has happened. Once calm is restored, fundamental issues relating to the broader question of governance will need to be addressed - including, very importantly, the rebuilding of East Timor's police force, which has been reduced to being completely ineffective.The United Nations is going to have to play an important part in the way forward for East Timor, just as it has done in the past since 1998 or early 1999. The Secretary General is due to report to the United Nations Security Council on 6 June, giving advice to the Security Council on the way forward for the United Nations in East Timor. That is going to be an important report, because the Security Council has to make a decision by 20 June on whether to renew the mandate for the current United Nations mission and if the mandate is to be renewed - and I think that is probably pretty much a given now - then the nature of that new mandate; what role the United Nations will play. The Australian government is giving a lot of thought to that at the moment. We will have discussions before too long with the East Timorese government about it and obviously, importantly, with the permanent members of the Security Council, other countries on the Security Council and the United Nations Secretariat. I think it is important that we do form a specific view on how the United Nations should go forward in East Timor, and we will be doing that.With regard to the second part of the honourable member's question, let me say that the government has responded quickly to the humanitarian dimension of the crisis. We initially pledged $1 million in immediate assistance to Australian non-government organisations in East Timor. We are now going to provide an additional $2 million, $1 million of which will be for urgently needed food, water, shelter and medical supplies from Australia to East Timor. We have also sent some medical supplies to East Timor over the weekend. We will also be making a further $1 million available to UNICEF and other international agencies to assist in efforts to provide for the thousands of displaced people in East Timor.We have medically evacuated two seriously ill East Timorese police officers and they are now in a stable condition in the Royal Darwin Hospital. We have medivaced a further seven injured patients. As of this morning, 422 people have been evacuated from East Timor on military flights, including 157 Australians. Citizens from over 30 other countries have also been evacuated. Of course, the government's first priority is the safety of Australians. That there are Australians who have wanted to leave explains why we have given priority to evacuating those 157 Australians who wanted to leave. We will do what we can to help the people of East Timor achieve stability but also provide now the humanitarian assistance that is necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Australia's system of corporations law rests on Commonwealth power from the Constitution, which is a part power, and referred powers from the states, which make up the difference. The states have referred to the Commonwealth their powers over corporations so that our system can be seamless under the one national regulator. Unfortunately that referral is due to end on 15 July of this year - less than eight weeks away. Only two states have renewed the referral. They are South Australia and Tasmania. I warned in this House in March of this year that unless referrals were forthcoming from the remainder of the states then Australia's system of corporations law would be subject to constitutional challenge and decisions made by the corporate regulator could be undone on constitutional grounds. In addition to that, this would affect investment and business costs, as the possibility would arise that some parts of the Corporations Law were deemed constitutional and others not.I wrote to the remaining state governments - Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - last week and requested that they extend the referral of their power over corporations from July 2006 and that they do it as a matter of urgency. I stress again that this is only eight weeks away. There has been a suggestion from some of the Labor states that they may not renew this referral because the government has relied upon the corporations power for its industrial relations legislation. I assure the House that the Commonwealth has not used the referred power to support its recent industrial relations legislation and has no intention of doing so. Extending the reference power relating to corporations has nothing to do with the use of the Commonwealth's own constitutional power in relation to corporations as a basis for industrial relations reforms. This is something that is far too important for politics. It is something that should not be delayed. It should not have got to this stage. I call on the remaining states to immediately renew that referral of power so that Australia's Corporations Law can continue seamlessly, immune from constitutional challenge, in the interests of the business community and the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I half expected a question from the Leader of the Opposition on this issue today. If he had cared to read on, in other comments I made today I also reflected on and referred to the incredible strength of the coalition here in Canberra and the benefits that have been delivered to 20 million Australians over the 10 years we have been in office. All the Leader of the Opposition needs to worry about is whether the numbers on this side of the House are going to remain the same. They are greater than the numbers on that side of the House. The Liberal and National parties will maintain strong and stable government in Australia, as we have done over the last 10 years. I would respectfully suggest that the Leader of the Opposition cast a wary eye behind him at his factional warriors. They did not quite get the member for Hotham, but they got the member for Corio, they got the member for Maribyrnong, and now Bill Shorten has come in and they have the member for Lalor ready to go. So if I were the Leader of the Opposition I would not worry too much about the Liberal and National parties; I would be worried about the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Two and a half weeks ago the Australian government, recognising the instability in East Timor, prepositioned its Defence Force and, when the request formally came from the East Timorese government to provide military assistance to bring peace and stability to the country, we responded alongside Malaysia and also Portugal and New Zealand. At the moment there are 1,300 Australian Defence Force personnel directly on the ground in East Timor. There are 2,000 in the total region of East Timor supporting this deployment and another 1,000 supporting it from here in Australia.At the moment the key areas of infrastructure have been secured, particularly the airport, the wharf, the United Nations compound and also the police headquarters. In the last 24 hours more than 200 weapons have been removed from people on the streets. These are predominantly young criminal thugs and people who are taking advantage of an environment of lawlessness.In a military sense, it is important that Australians understand that the East Timorese army has returned willingly to its barracks. As we speak today, the East Timorese police members are returning to their academy and also to their headquarters. Brigadier Mick Slater has been in consultation over the last 24 hours with the East Timorese authorities, military police and political authorities with a view to developing and supporting an effective and appropriate policing strategy for East Timor.It is also important that I advise the House that there has been some concern expressed by some aid organisations about their security in providing humanitarian and other support to the East Timorese. It is very important that Australians appreciate that the priorities for Australia's Defence Force in East Timor should be determined by Brigadier Mick Slater, who commands our ADF personnel, in consultation with a higher command of Defence. Nonetheless, I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force to ensure that Brigadier Slater and his officers are aware of the needs of aid organisations, in particular that of World Vision and its chairman, Reverend Tim Costello, in discharging their responsibilities. In that regard, I encourage all Australians to support not only World Vision, Red Cross and Caritas but other important aid agencies providing assistance in East Timor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Of course, the member for Mallee takes a very keen interest in this important subject of improved access for produce from his electorate into the Chinese market. It is well known that, currently, China is the engine of global growth and that annual GDP growth of 9.5 per cent in China is expected to continue for quite a long time. China's leaders in fact say that they expect nine per cent plus growth to continue through to 2020. China is already our second largest merchandise export market and trade has quadrupled in the last 10 years. Last week the fifth round of free trade agreement negotiations with China were held in Beijing and very useful progress was made. In those discussions China reaffirmed that the FTA will be comprehensive and that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed - two very important principles that we have argued for in negotiating this FTA and others. China accepts that sensitive issues such as services, investment and agriculture will be in the free trade agreement negotiation.Importantly, Australia tabled text of 15 chapters for this meeting and China has now agreed to negotiate, mostly on the basis of that text. China also agreed to include government procurement and investment. China's government purchasing is growing and is going to be an enormous market in the future. We need to get access to that. Agriculture, manufacturing and resources negotiations will begin in September, and services and investment later in the year.The recent DHL-Austrade Export Barometer shows more exporters than ever are looking to China for future orders. They are focusing on the growing market in China. Through the FTA negotiations, we are seeking to ensure that there are growing and increasing opportunities for Australia's exporters in the Chinese market on a fair basis. Our policy of pursuing multilateral trade negotiations, as well as FTAs such as that which we are negotiating with China, is focused on strengthening the Australian economy, providing more opportunity for exporters to grow their export effort from Australia and generating jobs in Australia, keeping the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Forde and I appreciate her interest in this. The Australian government expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the victims of the major earthquake that struck Jogjakarta on 27 May. This was an earthquake of 6.2 on the Richter scale and it occurred just off the coast of South Java, about 25 kilometres south of Jogjakarta. The social affairs minister of Indonesia estimates the death toll has now reached nearly 5,000. Injuries are estimated at over 20,000, although that number is continuing to climb. It is estimated that about 100,000 people have been displaced and are in need of shelter. Not surprisingly, the Indonesian President, President Yudhoyono, has declared a three-month state of emergency and he has even gone to the extent of establishing a temporary office in Jogjakarta.We will provide some funding to Indonesia's disaster management agency under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, and that funding is improving the response capability of the Indonesians. Yesterday, as I think the House knows, the Prime Minister spoke to President Yudhoyono and offered Australia's continuing assistance. Within hours of the earthquake, Australia announced $1 million for the Indonesian Red Cross to assess the damage, provide early medical assistance and set up kitchens to feed the victims of the earthquake. On Sunday, as the situation became clearer, the government tripled that figure. So $3 million now will be used to fund the Indonesian Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, the International Federation of the Red Cross, key UN agencies and of course Australian non-government organisations on the ground. The Indonesian President has requested medical assistance in particular, and a medical team, which is funded by AusAID, will be arriving during the course of today. Australia will also send an essential services team and an engineering team to examine the infrastructure needs and to see what specific additional assistance Australia might be able to undertake.In terms of the consular response, within hours the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a 24-hour emergency hotline to take calls from the public, and the embassy established an office in a hotel in Jogjakarta so that we could try to identify whether there were any Australian victims. We had a register of 86 Australians living and working in Jogjakarta, and I understand that all 86 have now been accounted for. We have no reports at all of Australian casualties as a result of the earthquake, but we will continue to monitor the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. I acknowledge his former role as a public hospital doctor in Adelaide. I have to say, it is nice to get a health question. Isn't it interesting that they only come from members on this side of the House? I am not so surprised, because this government is proud of our Medicare system, and that is why we are always trying to make a good system even better. To take a few examples, we provided incentives that mean that the bulk-billing rates for children and country people are at an all-time high, we have brought allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and psychologists into Medicare for the first time in history and the government will shortly be spending $1.9 billion on mental health because this area has been too long neglected.In this instance, let me say that the government has certainly not neglected the need for after-hour GP services. This government supports fee for service, and that is why we have put a $10 loading onto after-hour GP consultations. So far $53 million has been spent on our round-the-clock Medicare loading. But sometimes additional incentives are needed both to start new after-hour clinics and to keep old ones going. Last week the government announced that there would be five new after-hour clinics, each to be funded to the tune of $200,000, and 37 existing after-hour clinics would receive $100,000 to stay open, including one at the Blackwood and District Community Hospital in the electorate of Boothby. These new commitments are part of meeting an important election commitment and they help to demonstrate that this government, not that opposition, is most definitely the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, at the end of it, is no. I am aware of the work that the Leader of the Opposition has been referring to. I am not aware that it was instigated or endorsed by the minister for agriculture. I understand that it had been instigated by the GRDC - the Grains Research and Development Corporation - which is an independent body. The Leader of the Opposition would be well aware of the background to that. At the moment a number of elements of research are being done into the grains industry and the future of the grains industry that we are well aware of.As far as undermining my position, the government's position and the single desk today is concerned, the answer to that question is no. It is not undermining the position that I have taken when speaking at public meetings and the government's position today with regard to support of the single desk and looking after the interests of Australia's wheat growers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The member for Riverina will be pleased to be able to inform the wheat growers in Junee, Illabo, Temora and Cootamundra in her electorate that today Wheat Australia have announced that they have concluded a commercially acceptable deal to sell 350,000 tonnes of wheat to the IGB in Iraq. This is good news for Australian wheat growers and good news for the trade relationship between Australia and Iraq.I think all members of the House would be aware of the history of this deal. It has had a bit of rough time at times over the last few weeks in its development and negotiation. Even early last week it looked as though it was not going to go ahead. I acknowledge the tenacity of Wheat Australia in sticking with the negotiations and achieving this very important outcome for Australia's wheat growers.Earlier this year, the Iraqi government indicated that they were going to set aside their commercial relationship with the AWB during the Cole inquiry - and that was a reasonable course of action for them to take. Following that, I took a trip to Iraq, and in Baghdad I met with the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Ahmad Chalabi, to seek access to that market and for Australian entities to negotiate in the tendering process for wheat. He indicated to me that he would agree that Australian entities could participate in the tender that was opened at the time and that we could tender for 350,000 tonnes of wheat. Wheat Australia has been participating since then in these negotiations to this very successful conclusion with the agreement today. Wheat Australia has announced today that it will be moving ahead with that.It was interesting, as an aside, that last week, while I was overseas representing Australia in WTO negotiations and discussions, the member for Griffith was criticising me here in Australia for being over there negotiating multilateral agreements that the Australian Labor Party wholeheartedly support. He said: 'Oh, he shouldn't be over there. He should be flying to Baghdad to fix this up.' What the member for Griffith does not realise is that the telephones still work in Baghdad. Three days beforehand, I was talking to Dr Chalabi about these issues. So we were sorting them out. When the member for Griffith was criticising me here in Australia, we were sorting the problems out with this deal.Today in their announcement of the 350,000 tonnes sale of wheat, Wheat Australia congratulated the federal government and thanked it for its support. They said:With commercial terms now agreed, it is also appropriate that Wheat Australia acknowledge the federal government for their efforts in securing this opportunity for Australian growers to tender for the supply of wheat into Iraq.The market is open. They will have the opportunity to compete in further tenders. And we fully expect that they will.</DOC>

Our government and our party are committed to ensuring that the environment of Australia stays free of exotic pests and diseases to keep safe our agriculture and the food products we export to the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore who, along with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the Special Minister of State and a number of other members on this side of the House, including the member for Riverina and one or two on the other side of the House - or on the cross benches at least - have expressed some concerns about this issue. If we are interested in analysing what it is all about, we should recall that the decision of the New South Wales government to sell its 58 per cent ownership of the Snowy really decided what was going to happen. The Commonwealth holds 13 per cent, the New South Wales government 58 per cent and the remainder is held by the Victorian government. I note also that, when the resolution to approve the sale of the federal government's 13 per cent was presented to the parliament, the Labor Party in opposition supported that resolution. I note also that as recently as last Friday the Leader of the Opposition reaffirmed the support of the federal parliamentary Labor Party for the sale of the Snowy.As I indicated to parliament last week, we support the sale of the Commonwealth's 13 per cent share in the Snowy Hydro for three reasons. Firstly, with New South Wales as the majority shareholder, with 58 per cent of the company, having announced that they were going to sell, there was little point in the Commonwealth holding on to our minority 13 per cent, unless we were going to use budget funds to buy out the New South Wales government share, and we took the decision that that would not have been a good use of those budget funds. Secondly, the water needs of downstream users and the environment are fully protected by the current water licensing regime. There is a common belief, which is mistaken, that the water is owned by the company - it is not. It is owned by the public via the New South Wales government and is made available by a 75-year licence. Thirdly, we believe that the private sector is better at running private businesses than the government.I am aware that the member for Gilmore, the member for Eden-Monaro in particular, and a number of other members of this House are concerned about the potential for foreign ownership of the Snowy Hydro. As a result, as I foreshadowed last week, the government has considered and decided to introduce into legislation measures to implement foreign ownership caps and other Australian protections in relation to Snowy Hydro Ltd. This is fully consistent with the approach we have taken in relation to entities such as Telstra and Qantas. The government will introduce legislation in June that imposes the following permanent restrictions on Snowy Hydro Ltd. Firstly, no foreign individual or company will be permitted to own greater than 15 per cent of Snowy Hydro. Secondly, foreign ownership in total will not be permitted to exceed 35 per cent of the company. Thirdly, the head office of the company must remain in Australia and be located in Cooma. Fourthly, Snowy Hydro Ltd must maintain a substantial business and operational presence in Australia. Fifthly, at least two-thirds of the directors of the board of Snowy Hydro and the chairman of any meeting of the board and shareholders must also be Australian citizens. Finally, Snowy Hydro Ltd must remain incorporated in Australia.The New South Wales and Victorian governments have indicated that they will support this Commonwealth legislation. We will seek to have the legislation debated and passed by the end of June 2006. This would allow the sale to proceed about the middle of this year. In addition, the selling governments have already proposed to the ASX that a 10 per cent limit on any individual, domestic or foreign shareholding be placed in Snowy Hydro's constitution for at least four years to ensure an appropriate spread of ownership. The three selling governments will continue to seek approval for this proposal from the ASX.I know there will be those who will continue to oppose any sale of Snowy Hydro, but with the protection for water users and the protections on foreign ownership I believe that we can proceed with the sale confident that the Australian community can only benefit from the sale. Again, I record my thanks to the member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Gilmore and the member for Riverina in particular for the very effective and thoughtful campaign they have brought to bear on this difficult but important issue. The outcome reflects great credit on their advocacy.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I was not. Obviously, like any other person in public life, if somebody thinks poorly of decisions with which I am associated, that is a matter for personal regret. My attention having been drawn to what the lady has had to say, I can only make the observation, as I did last week, that the interesting piece of information, which may be of passing interest to the Leader of the Opposition and to other members of this parliament, is that Spotlight has, as many people in the House know, recently opened a new outlet in Mount Druitt. Mount Druitt, unlike many other parts of Sydney, still suffers from an unacceptably high level of unemployment. -  - It is very interesting: the crescendo rises whenever you talk about unemployment and workplace relations. There are 40 people, I am told, who have been engaged -  - I can hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - '90 dollars' she is saying. Spotlight has, I am told, opened a new store at Mount Druitt in Western Sydney. The unemployment rate in Mount Druitt is over 10 per cent. I am further informed that 38 of the 40 new staff employed on AWAs in Spotlight at Mount Druitt in Western Sydney were previously unemployed. In other words, there are 38 people who are better off. The piercing voice of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition keeps saying '90 dollars' -  - It is not actually $90; it is $338.10, because that is the difference between the amount a job seeker on the unemployment benefit of $205.30 a week receives and the amount that they will receive under a Spotlight AWA of $543.40 a week. Like my friend Tony Blair, I believe fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. As a result of our policy, 38 people in Mount Druitt have been given the chance of a job and they are $338 a week better off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his interest in this issue. I think all of us would agree that we welcome the advice from the Australian Defence Force that they are making significant progress in restoring peace to Dili, in particular, in East Timor. The situation there is obviously getting better. There is still a high level of tension and there are still reports today of confrontation - this time between gangs. So there is work to be done, but I think the Australian Defence Force are showing their characteristic professionalism in doing the job and doing it in the way they know best.I also note the arrival yesterday of 46 Australian Federal Police officers. Amongst the tasks I hope they will be able to undertake is to assist with the investigation into the atrocious killing of nine unarmed members of the East Timor police force last week. This was an appalling and brutal act. I think if Australia can make a good contribution to the investigation that will be something that all Australians will warmly welcome.We are also pleased that the Council of State chaired by President Xanana Gusmao has been meeting and dialogue is under way to try to resolve what are clearly political differences between a number of the leaders in East Timor. I am also pleased to note that Ian Martin, who will be well known to quite a few people in this House as the special envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has arrived in Dili and is having discussions with President Gusmao and others. Also, he will be meeting Brigadier Slater, the Australian commander in East Timor, this afternoon.The restoration of stability is certainly helping to ease the humanitarian situation. The staff of our embassy have visited all the major centres in Dili where internally displaced people are currently located. They have assessed that the people who are internally displaced have access to clean drinking water and food, the conditions are not cramped and medical issues are not a major problem. I want to emphasise that. I think organisations like the Red Cross are doing very well to help those people.The Australian military has contributed greatly to easing the humanitarian situation in East Timor. Because of the contribution to the restoration of stability by the Australian Defence Force, there is now delivery of food and water to displaced Timorese. Brigadier Slater is doing an outstanding job in East Timor and I think the House should be proud of the work he and his soldiers are doing there. As he said this morning, 'The sooner we get the guns off the street, the easier it will be for the aid agencies. The humanitarian situation is not that bad. It will get bad if we do not get security sorted out first.'That sentiment has been pretty much replicated by the Secretary-General's special representative, Mr Hasegawa, who was reported today as saying, 'We have been able to step up our efforts to meet the most pressing food and water needs of the people displaced from their homes in Dili. The improved security situation and direct support of the Australian military forces where possible have greatly assisted this process.' I just want to emphasise that. The humanitarian situation is being addressed. A lot of the problems are not as great as they have been portrayed from time to time. I think the Australian Defence Force is doing a simply outstanding job. I call on all commentators to let our experienced military and hardworking professionals just get on with their jobs.</DOC>

 - I have repeatedly said that the strength of the Australian economy is due to the efforts of the working men and women of this country. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the working men and women of Australia have been more adequately rewarded for their efforts under this government than they were under the former Labor government. The last person in this parliament who can speak with pride about rewarding the ordinary working men and women of this country is the former Deputy Prime Minister in the Keating government because, as those who follow these matters will know, real wages under this government have increased by 16.8 per cent over the last 10 years compared to a paltry increase of only 1.3 per cent under Labor. In relation to Mrs Annette Harris, I am informed that she exercised her right to reject the AWA and remains employed as a part-time employee on the relevant award after refusing to accept the AWA.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question and acknowledge his interest in national economic matters. Retail trade figures released today for April 2006 showed that retail trade rose 1.4 per cent for the month and is 7.4 per cent higher through the year. They were unexpectedly high figures, which show robust consumer growth in retail trade. Conversely, building approvals released for the month of April fell 3.4 per cent and are down 7.5 per cent for the year. That shows us that housing most probably will continue to detract from growth through the course of 2006-07.An OECD outlook was recently released which forecast Australia's calendar growth for 2007 at 3.7 per cent compared to the rest of the OECD at 2.9 per cent. That shows that Australia again will be picking up in 2007, outpacing most of the developed world - indeed, as we have outpaced most of the developed world over the last 10 years. Growth in Australia over the last 10 years has averaged 3.6 per cent compared to the OECD average of 2.7 per cent. We have an Australian economy which has outpaced the developed world and which is forecast in 2007 to do the same again. Importantly, the OECD says that only 10 of 28 countries in the OECD are expected to balance their budgets in 2007. Of course, one of those is Australia, which will be running the ninth surplus budget in the 11 budgets since this government was elected.As we know, the Commonwealth is forecasting a surplus budget of one per cent of GDP in 2006-07. Unfortunately, the states are not forecasting budget surpluses either in 2005-06 or in 2006-07. Cumulatively, state and local governments are running deficits of 0.5 per cent and 0.6 per cent of GDP in those successive years.If it were not for the Commonwealth government running a budget surplus which outweighs the combined position of the state and local government sectors, government would not be adding to saving in this country. As we know, with strong business investment, business is running down savings. As we also know, the household sector is not saving either. This is the importance of good strong economic management. We are now in the longest period of continuous growth in Australia's history after 10 years of this government, and keeping the fiscal position in the strong position that it is is a very big part of that. We fought to get the budget back into surplus against the opposition of the Labor Party and we need to fight for good economic management in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert - a very strong advocate for 3rd Brigade in Townsville - for his question. I join with the member for Herbert, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the parliament and the Australian people in congratulating its commanding officer, Brigadier Mick Slater, for the outstanding job that he and his men are doing in East Timor. It is extremely important that Brigadier Slater have full responsibility for making all of the decisions that need to be made in prioritising the activities and functions of our Defence Force in East Timor.This morning Brigadier Slater said that Dili is a different place from what it was three days ago, that there is no gunfire in the city or in the foothills and that there are many people in Dili who are going about their business. That is not to say that Dili or East Timor are safe places, but they are safer. It is worth remembering that 2½ weeks ago the Australian government prepositioned the Defence Force in anticipation that a request may come from the East Timorese government to provide military assistance to bring peace and order to the country. That request arrived late last Wednesday and by Thursday afternoon the first element of Australian Defence Force troops arrived at Dili airport to secure it. All of the 1,300 Defence Force personnel were fully deployed yesterday in East Timor.It is worth also remembering that the day that the request arrived there were raging gun battles in the streets of Dili with the heinous murder of innocent unarmed police officers. There were also armed civilians. From that period we have now gone to an environment where we still see relatively stable, if not declining, evidence of rogue criminal gang related activity in the streets of Dili. It remains a dangerous place, but it is safer than it was and it is safer because of the actions of the Australian Defence Force.In the last two days 450 weapons have been removed from thugs and gangs on the streets of Dili. Those weapons include high-powered rifles, handguns, shotguns, grenades, machetes and a whole variety of implements that have been used by these gangs. In the last 24 hours, 160 East Timorese police have voluntarily returned to their headquarters and their academy and 260 weapons have been handed in by them. The East Timorese army has now gone back to its barracks quite cooperatively, and at the moment the detention arrangements have been settled for the Australian Defence Force. Those who are suspected of having committed a serious crime or who are detected in the process of committing it are being detained. A well-developed framework to monitor every stage of that process has been agreed. A detention management team, including military police and Australian Defence Force lawyers, has worked with the East Timorese authorities. Again, on behalf of the House and the Australian people, I thank and I congratulate the Australian Defence Force. The task ahead remains far from complete, but human life in East Timor is much safer today than it was a week ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question, and I congratulate him on what a great job he is doing as the member for Bonner. This government introduced the largest income tax cuts in Australia's history in 2000. Since introducing the largest income tax cuts in Australian history in 2000, this government has cut tax in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a consequence of those tax cuts, you will now be on a 15c rate between $6,000 and $25,000, you will be on a 30c rate between $25,000 and $70,000, you will be on a 40c rate between $75,000 and $150,000, and you will be on the top rate of 45 per cent only on each dollar over $150,000. Under the Labor Party, between $20,000 and $50,000, you faced rates of 33c, 43c and 47c compared with 30c under this government. Indeed, many of us remember that the last tax cut that the Labor Party promised did not even survive - did I say 'promise'; no, it was L-A-W - the 1993 election.As a consequence of this, since 1995-96 reductions in tax and growth in real wages have increased the real disposable income of the average individual earner by 17.8 per cent. That is 17.8 per cent as a consequence of tax cuts and increases in real disposable income. The consequence of that is that average wage earners in Australia are far better off under a coalition government than they ever were under the Labor Party. Not only have real wages gone up but taxes have come down. When you put that together with the increase in family allowances, families are doing even better.I am very pleased that the member for Grayndler is showing the government his best side - an old tactic but a good one, to stand up and pretend you are not interested when you are getting a barb because your government did not do anything for real wage earners, did not do anything for income tax and stands condemned by the Australian people as a consequence. The moral of this is as follows: the coalition stands for average workers in Australia. It is under a coalition government that their wages have gone up. The coalition government stands for average wage earners when it comes to tax, and average wage earners will always be better off under a coalition government than under a Labor government.</DOC>

 - It will be no surprise to the member for New England, as a member of both the New South Wales and federal parliaments, to be reminded of the doctrine that no one parliament can bind the actions of a future parliament. Self-evidently, anything passed by this parliament can be repealed by a future parliament. Indeed, I even recall examples in the past: so certain was one government that tax reductions it might implement in one parliament were going to be repealed by another parliament it decided not to introduce the promised tax cuts in the first place.Can I say to the member for New England: he has given a description of the so-called permanent restrictions. That is a description that the member for New England has employed. We are going to legislate and I would not expect a future parliament to repeal that legislation, particularly as the only party that is ever likely to form a government in this parliament other than the coalition is the Labor Party and the Labor Party is committed on this issue to the same policy as the government. I think the likelihood of it being repealed in the future is very remote, and the member for New England knows it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question and her interest. The latest official estimate of the death toll from the earthquake near Yogyakarta is 5,136. Injuries are estimated at 20,000 and up to 200,000 people are now in need of shelter as a result of 60,000 homes being destroyed. This is a major disaster. The Australian government will now provide $7½ million for critical humanitarian assistance to the survivors of the earthquake, and as part of this we will send supplies and over 80 experts to Yogyakarta urgently to assist with the relief and recovery effort.An Australian medical team of 27 medical and surgical personnel, all coming from New South Wales, is going to depart for Indonesia today to join with the AusAID team which is already on the ground in Yogyakarta. That team coming from New South Wales will include surgeons and operating staff, disaster medicine specialists and logisticians. Also, they will take with them 12 tonnes of medical equipment. Food and water will also accompany the team. AusAID staff who have been on the ground since Saturday are assisting with the assessment of the needs of the people of the Yogyakarta area. They have recommended sending urgent orthopaedic instruments as a result of the massive injuries suffered by people, and those orthopaedic instruments are now on their way.There have been reports of heavy rain falling in the area, and that is of course compounding the challenges of the relief effort, so AusAID are purchasing tarpaulins for the local people to help address that problem. There have been also, importantly, a large number of aftershocks. There have been 750 reported, and that means that people have been very reluctant to return to their own buildings. So at this time of crisis Indonesians are calling on their friends and their neighbours to help them out and, because this is a genuine humanitarian catastrophe, I think we have a humanitarian obligation to assist, so assisting is what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I actually thank the member for Jagajaga for this question, because this government now has in training near record levels of people in this country - close to 400,000. When Labor were last in office they had a mere 122,000 people in training. So I think 10 years of achievement speaks for itself. In fact, I can quote the South Australian Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education, Paul Caica. He said in today's Adelaide Advertiser that 'businesses need to play their part in creating opportunities for young people' -  - and the first step was of course to identify their needs. It is certainly not government's fault alone that there are not enough people where businesses themselves want them. But at the end of it this government is working hard on that, with record amounts of money - far more money than Labor ever imagined they would put towards the training system. We are also very much dedicated to the task of saying to business, 'If you plan for the sort of workforce you want, we will give a training system in a way that will make sure that your needs are met when you need them.' We are in partnership with the eight state and territory governments, who themselves have a variety of responses that conflict with that general approach.The mining industry certainly does train people - there is no doubt about that - but it is absolutely fundamental that major industries such as mining continue to understand that these days, unlike when Labor was in office when there was a large pool of unemployed for them to draw upon, there are far fewer unemployed in this country and so the commitment to training has to be redoubled and has to start in the boardrooms and work its way out. As Paul Caica, the South Australian minister, said, governments alone cannot do this. It is important that business plays its part.</DOC>

 - I do appreciate the member for Stirling's interest in this issue and I can inform him and the House that the World Health Organisation continues to believe that Australia is as well prepared as any other country on earth for a possible flu pandemic. I stress that a pandemic outbreak is possible. It is not probable, although the recent deaths of up to seven family members in Indonesia show that the danger remains real. So far the government has committed almost $600 million to pandemic preparedness. This money has, amongst other things, given us an antiviral stockpile that is building up to almost nine million courses, 50 million syringes and 40 million surgical masks. We will purchase up to five million doses of bird flu vaccine, should this pass appropriate tests. We are researching a range of bird flu issues including quick testing facilities, we are providing extra equipment to public hospitals and we have upgraded our laboratory and surveillance capacity.Today the government has released a revised Australian health management plan for pandemic influenza. One of the features of the new plan is the stress on issues such as personal hygiene, social distancing and home quarantine as a means of preventing the spread of any pandemic outbreak. Today the government also announced details of Exercise Cumpston 06, which will be held over four days in October, to test our readiness to deal with infected travellers arriving at a major international airport.

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The member is of course the chairman of the government members committee dealing with issues of workplace relations and he has a very long and continuing  interest in workplace relations. I was asked yesterday by the member for Jagajaga about workers being stood down at the Teys Bros meatworks in Naracoorte in South Australia. The member for Jagajaga suggested in her question that 260 Australian workers at the meatworks had had their employment reduced to four days a week with a reduction in pay because of a shortage of stock. She also suggested that overseas workers brought to Australia on temporary 457 visas are being given enough slaughter work and extra work, such as night cleaning, to get them a full working week in order to meet their visa requirements. I indicated yesterday that I was not personally aware of the facts of this matter and that I would seek to check them, as long experience has told me not to automatically accept what is put to me in this place. I am therefore very pleased to inform the House that I have had an opportunity to check the facts and to get some advice and on this occasion the suggestions made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are completely wrong.I am advised that Teys Bros employs its Australian and overseas workers on the same Australian workplace agreements. Consistent with the normal practice for this industry, the AWAs of both Australian and foreign workers alike include provisions where workers can be legally stood down on days where there is insufficient work, and where this occurs both Australian and foreign workers are stood down and they are not paid. There is no discrimination, I am told, between the Australian and foreign workers - which is directly contrary to what was suggested by the member for Jagajaga - and that is what happened in this case. - Responding to normal seasonal variations in its business, Teys was required to stand down all workers from a five-day shift to a four-day shift in recent weeks. Again, contrary to the suggestion from the member for Jagajaga, both foreign and Australian workers were affected.The member for Jagajaga also suggested that foreign workers had been offered extra work to keep them in full-time employment to comply with their visa conditions. Again, I am told this is simply not the case. I am told that at times Teys Bros have offered their employees, both locally and foreign sourced, the opportunity to do unskilled labour on the days they were stood down from normal duties. Contrary again to the suggestion from the member for Jagajaga, it appears that a small group of both foreign and Australian workers took up these opportunities - five foreigners and five Australian workers - again, no discrimination between the two groups. Again, contrary to the suggestion of the member for Jagajaga that this was due to a visa requirement which placed foreign workers in a more privileged position than local workers, this offer appears to have been made to both types of workers in an attempt by the company to treat all their workers fairly - and for this the government does not seek in any way to condemn the company. In fact, I am advised that this fair treatment may amount to a technical breach of the visa requirements because the foreign workers are required to be employed only in the skilled positions that they are sponsored to undertake. DIMA officials are talking to the company about that.The opposition has been prepared to have a go at Teys Bros without getting its facts right. That is typical of the dishonest fear campaign being run on matters of industrial relations by not only the Leader of the Opposition but now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is worth telling the House a few facts about this wonderful Australian employer and wonderful Australian company. Teys Bros is the largest Australian owned beef processor and it is the largest privately owned company in Queensland. It owns six plants across Australia, in Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and it employs about 2,100 workers. Nationally the company employs 11 apprentices and 218 trainees, all of whom are Australian. Teys Bros is the largest single employer in Naracoorte, providing direct employment for 269 people, of whom less than 10 per cent are foreign workers, and generating $11 million in wages that flow directly into the local community. - Rather than attempt to denigrate the performance of a decent Australian company that provides great employment opportunities, the opposition should cease its negative tactics and applaud the contributions that this company is making to the employment opportunities of Australians in this part of South Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I note that the unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent in her electorate of Greenway is below the national average, and almost half what it was at 8.8 per cent when Labor was in government. That is a result of the strong economic management of this government, which has led to more jobs for people not only in Greenway but right throughout Australia.The honourable member asked me about the continuing absurd claims made by the opposition and the unions about occupational health and safety under Work Choices. I again reiterate to the House that occupational health and safety remains a responsibility of the states and territories and indeed is legislated for by the states and territories in Australia. But this has not stopped those opposite and others from running around suggesting otherwise. We have had Labor's great new hope, Bill Shorten, running around suggesting that occupational health and safety training is somehow at risk under Work Choices. Indeed, on Sky News on 22 May, Mr Shorten had this exchange with David Spears, who asked: 'Do you accept that workers at this mine or any mine or any workplace will still be able to receive union provided safety training under the new laws?' Mr Shorten responded, 'No. I don't accept that.'That was pretty clear. But I was very surprised recently when I came across a union collective agreement which was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate, I am advised, on 12 May this year - a union collective agreement lodged since the introduction of the Work Choices legislation on 27 March. When I look in this agreement I find clause 26 -  - I see clause 26, which is headed -  - 'Occupational health and safety'. Clause 26.2 states:... the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, its regulations and associated safety legislation will apply.And it goes on to say:All employees will participate in safety training programs, including detailed induction on refinery and project safety procedures.So this clearly sets out that the Victorian occupational health and safety law will continue to prevail. Not only that, when I turn over to the next page I find the following in clause 26.11:Occupational health and safety representatives will be provided with five days paid training for attendance at an occupational health and safety course consistent with the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004.In other words, union training, if that is the choice, will continue to be provided as part of that occupational health and safety training if that is what the Victorian legislation prescribes. As I said, this was a surprising agreement in light of the comments from the opposition and, particularly, in light of that interview with Mr Shorten on the television recently. When I turn to the back of this agreement to see who the signatories are, I see that this agreement, lodged on 12 May, was signed, for and on behalf of the Australian Workers Union, by the assistant secretary of the Australian Workers Union. So we have Mr Shorten and others opposite going around Australia saying - as Mr Shorten did on Sky News - 'I don't accept that workers will still be able to receive union provided safety training,' when his own union is negotiating an agreement under Work Choices which provides specifically for the continued operation of occupational health and safety laws and, indeed, training in Australia. This says once again what the unions and those opposite know, and that is that occupational health and safety is a matter for the states and territories in Australia and nothing in Work Choices will stop training being provided by a union if that is what the parties decide.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question because I know that the member for Blair, like many members of this House, appreciates particularly the importance of temporary workers entering Australia as a source of labour, particularly in regional areas, where there are skills shortages that cannot be met in the local labour markets. Many leaders of state and territory governments around Australia have forcibly put those views over time. It is very obvious that skills shortages which are left unmet often deny other Australians work opportunities. In these cases, companies can turn to temporary workers from overseas and use particularly the form of visa known as a 457.Employers are particularly supportive of these measures. Without them many of those companies would have trouble in continuing to expand their operations or maintain them. Often that would put at risk the jobs of Australians. It is for this reason that the government has been responding positively to community and business needs.But that support is not universal. The Labor Party have made no secret of their dislike for the temporary entry visa system. They are dressing these arguments up in ways which I think bring them no merit. The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he does not want companies bringing in qualified workers and welders. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been critical of workers entering under the 457 system and so has the member for Watson. - I am interested that the member for Sydney is speaking about this matter, because there are other members of this House who recognise the value of people coming in under the temporary work visas, and they even write at times to the minister on behalf of their constituents. - I would like to see her remain, because I make the point that there are numbers of members who write to the minister on behalf of constituents advancing the very reasons that this government gives for this program. In fact, I have a letter here from the member for Sydney. The member for Sydney wrote to the minister on 19 April. She said that she was concerned that a constituent could not expand his restaurant business until he could bring in a chef. She went on to say that her constituent had employed extra staff to work in expanding the business. She went on and said he had to turn down a lease on prime restaurant space because he was not able to expand his restaurant until he had received the approval.We know where the Labor Party stands on these matters. There are some members who go out and argue on behalf of their constituents that the visa system should be expanded, while there are others out there suggesting that these measures do not benefit the Australian community, do not create jobs and put jobs at risk - when nothing could be further from the truth, as the member for Sydney knows.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can inform him that today's international trade in goods and services figures show that the trade deficit narrowed to $1.1 billion, led by an increase in exports of five per cent or $799 million. The rise in exports was largely due to a solid increase in commodities exports, although, of course, the impact of Cyclone Glenda, which hit the Western Australian coast in late March and early April, would still be depressing exports from the North West Shelf and from the Pilbara.Over the past three years Australia's mining industry has invested around $31.6 billion in increasing its productive capacity, and this will lead to an increase in export volumes over the course of the year and into next year. The RBA financial aggregates were also released today. What they showed was that business credit rose by 1.9 per cent to be 17.2 per cent higher over the year. This shows that business is borrowing solidly for investment but that it is in a very strong position in relation to those borrowings with the share of profits at near historical highs in the Australian economy. Conversely, household credit is slowing, rising by one per cent in April to be 12.8 per cent higher over the year.What we see in these particular figures is an improvement on the export front. We see strong business investment in the Australian economy and moderating personal credit growth, which is consistent with the household sector slowing. This is important as the economy rebalances itself from domestic sources of growth to external sources of growth. Supported by a strong global economy over the years which are ahead, we should see that rebalancing continue.Prospects for the Australian economy are strong. The government's strong fiscal position is contributing to savings in Australia. The fact is that we have now reduced Labor's $96 billion of net debt to zero and are saving $8 billion in interest payments, the important tax cuts which are due to take effect in July -  - and the baby bonus, which no doubt the member for Melbourne has just taken advantage of. I look forward to him writing and thanking the government for the baby bonus that it introduced. And can I tell him that we wish he has many more children; we would be happy to pay him many more baby bonuses. These policies for families and these policies in relation to tax changes will support the Australian economy in the years which are ahead.The important thing for the Australian economy is this: strong, disciplined economic management. Nothing could be more important than keeping the Labor Party in opposition when it comes to strong economic management so that Australians have the opportunities of great jobs into the future.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Fadden for his question and for his interest. I think members of the House may have heard already this morning that President Gusmao has declared a state of grave crisis in East Timor. He has announced that he will be formally assuming the sole responsibility for the areas of defence and national security for a period of 30 days. He is doing so in his constitutional capacity as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of East Timor. I note that the President has appealed to all groups to hand over weapons to authorities, particularly to international forces. He has also foreshadowed some ministerial changes, and I understand they are being considered during the course of today.Although there are still clearly problems with security, nevertheless the Australian military presence in East Timor has created an environment where these kinds of political discussions and decisions can take place and where the East Timorese can organise themselves appropriately politically. Political reconciliation is obviously going to be the key to resolving the current crisis and to ensuring that East Timor has a stable future. I commend the leadership of East Timor for upholding the rule of law and for operating, as they are clearly and rightly endeavouring to do, within the confines of their own constitution. We would, of course, urge all sides, whilst they may have differences, to act in the best interests of the nation in endeavouring to try to reconcile those interests.Our ambassador and Brigadier Slater during the course of this morning had a meeting with Prime Minister Alkatiri and these messages have been reinforced at that meeting with Prime Minister Alkatiri. The meeting I understand was a friendly, constructive and positive meeting. It was the first meeting that Brigadier Slater had had with Prime Minister Alkatiri and I am glad it went well. I, for my part, have remained in constant contact with my East Timorese counterpart, Jose Ramos Horta.We do continue to receive reports of opportunistic gang violence in Dili. Certainly that was quite a problem during the latter part of yesterday. As Brigadier Slater said, some days will be worse than others. We have to expect that there will be difficulties from time to time. I do not think any of us should underestimate the complexity of the situation on the ground - the different fissures that there are in East Timorese society and the need to try and reconcile those. The Australian troops in East Timor, though, have made considerable progress. They have secured the centres where internally displaced people are located. They are doing a very good job in patrolling the streets. They have collected some 400 weapons so far, which is a great credit to them, but it does say something about the number of weapons there are out there.We are continuing to deliver immediate humanitarian assistance to East Timor, particularly through non-government organisations and United Nations agencies. Food and water have been delivered to tens of thousands of people. From today, Australian Defence Force C130 flights will deliver extra food and water supplies into East Timor. Brigadier Slater, our ambassador and others in East Timor deserve a high degree of praise and credit for what they are doing, and ultimately what they are doing is assisting the people of East Timor to get their lives back together again and to give the country a good future.The member for Sturt then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and recognise his keen interest in improving the opportunities for Australian exporters across the world through the multilateral trade negotiations called the Doha Round. Of course, the member for Cowper has many industries in his area, manufacturing industries as well as agricultural industries, that want better access into global markets. That is what the Australian government is looking for in seeking an ambitious outcome to this round of negotiations. It is our No. 1 trade priority and has been for a number of years.This round was launched in 2001, there have been a series of meetings and it is fast reaching a point in time where it must be concluded. There is only one way that it is going to be concluded successfully and to the satisfaction of Australian exporters, and that is if the major players and those countries that have got a contribution to make begin to make the political commitment that needs to be made now so that we can progress.Last week whilst overseas I chaired a meeting of key trade ministers, including those from the European Union and the United States, who are core to this negotiation, to set up a roadmap, if you like, through June and July. By the end of June we need to have achieved the modalities for agricultural market access and non-agricultural market access to be able to achieve our deadlines this year. It is now time those major players closely engaged so they can scope up the sorts of levels of commitment and compromise that are going to be needed to see this deal done. As I indicated, this round is our No. 1 trade policy priority. A successful outcome to this round would mean hundreds of billions of dollars of improved global welfare that Australia could participate in. It is incredibly important for our agricultural industries and obviously Australia's farmers to get better access to markets, particularly those in the European Union.We as a government have consistently over the years improved the circumstances in Australia for our exporters. We removed about $3½ billion worth of wholesale sales tax off the back of our exports and we have improved the economic environment in which they are operating in Australia to put them on a stronger platform to launch into markets across the world. This is an opportunity to remove on a multilateral basis many of those barriers in many of those markets across the world. Australia is playing a key role in these negotiations. We call on our major colleagues now to make the political commitment in the coming months to achieve the goals not just for our exporters and our economies but also to help lift millions of people out of poverty in the developing world. Success will create more opportunities for Australian exporters to help them create more jobs in their industries and ultimately to put more dollars into the pockets of working Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and for her interest in this area. I can inform her and the House that it is estimated that, in any one year, up to one in five Australians can suffer a significant mental health problem but that up to a half of all mental health problems are not effectively treated. We know that mental health problems can be hard to diagnose, difficult to treat and slow to cure, but this is a reason to increase our efforts in mental health care, not to reduce them.As part of its commitment to the Council of Australian Governments mental health program, the federal government recently announced $1.9 billion in additional mental health spending. Amongst other things, Medicare will be expanded to allow GPs and psychiatrists to refer patients to psychologists. It is estimated that this will mean an additional 400,000 psychologist consultations a year. GP and psychiatric practices will be supported to employ mental health nurses and it is estimated that an additional 36,000 patients a year will be helped through this measure. As well, the government will fund an extra 420 mental health nurse training places and an additional 200 clinical psychology training places, and the government will further expand the Better Outcomes in Mental Health program in regional areas.More good news from the Howard government: yesterday, thanks to the good work of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is momentarily absent from this parliament, I can say that an agreement to provide $54 million to the Youth Mental Health Foundation was finalised. Much mental health care in public hospitals or in supported accommodation remains, of course, the responsibility of the states, but I am confident that the federal government doing much more in its area of responsibilities will encourage the states to do what is needed in their area of responsibility.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that I have seen reports of a report by the Office of Workplace Services. I have also seen a press statement released today by the Office of Workplace Services which states 'that, despite media reports today to the contrary, the investigation into Cowra Abattoir Pty Ltd is yet to be finalised'. Now that the member for Perth, with his customary searching analysis, has raised the question of the Cowra Abattoir, let me say something about this company and let me say something about the campaign that is being waged by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, who apparently believe it is better for potentially 200 people to lose their jobs entirely because a firm goes out of business than it is for a firm to adjust its workforce down, retain the majority of them and keep the business going. - The truth is that what has happened at Cowra Abattoir reflects a situation that obtained before Work Choices was introduced and will obtain irrespective of what industrial relations system this country has. The reality is that Cowra Abattoir has been suffering financial difficulties for some time. I table a letter dated 16 February 2006 from Cowra Abattoir to all its employees which outlines the reasons the company came to the conclusion that it had to get by with a lesser number of employees.The truth is that, no matter what industrial relations system you have, there comes a time with many firms when either an adjustment in the size of the workforce or some adjustment in the conditions under which some of the workforce are employed is necessary in order to keep a firm going. I might remind the member for Perth that when his beloved industrial relations system governed this country in the early 1990s it did not stop a million Australians being thrown out of work because of the recession we had to have. The truth is that the attitude of the Labor Party is that it is better that everybody lose their job because the firm goes broke than there be some adjustment to the workforce to keep a firm going.No matter what generality of strong economic conditions we may have obtained in this country, there will always be some firms, through some combination of reasons, that are doing poorly. To suggest that when a firm is operating uneconomically it has no right to alter the structure of its workforce, it has no right to ask its workforce to accept a changed operation and it has no right in the end, regrettable though it might be, to retrench some of its workforce, but that it has to maintain all of its workforce at the same level of remuneration with the inevitable consequence that the firm is going to go out of business, defies rationality. It is that kind of thinking that helped throw a million people out of work when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member. Being a medical doctor, I know he is very interested in the issue. Since December 2003, there have been 224 cases of avian flu and 127 deaths from it. Last week the WHO importantly confirmed seven cases leading to six deaths in the northern part of Sumatra and it was suspected by the WHO that these deaths were caused by human-to-human infections among people living in very cramped conditions, although the WHO has gone on to say there is no evidence that this case indicates the virus can be spread easily between humans. Nevertheless, that incident is a salutary warning that this is still a very live and serious issue. Two days ago, the Indonesian government confirmed six more infections, including three deaths, elsewhere in Indonesia.Australia is taking a leading role in dealing with this issue in the region. We spent $140 million over four years to combat pandemics and emerging infectious diseases. We have been working with APEC since 2001 on assisting the region to prepare for this problem. On 7 and 8 June, Australia will lead and fund the APEC pandemic response exercise, which will test regional coordination and preparedness and identify where we can significantly improve emergency communications in the region. Eight economies are going to participate: China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan - or Chinese Taipei, as we say in APEC - Vietnam and also Chile.Finally, the honourable member asked if there were any alternative views. As was pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the other day, I am delighted to report there are not any alternative views. The member for Griffith is in lockstep with the government on this issue, so much so that, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pointed out, he published on Labor's web site, interestingly enough on 11 September last year, words which are simply lifted in slabs from the World Health Organisation, the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and, I think, very flatteringly, from our own health minister's documents as well.On the face of it, you would expect us to welcome the opposition simply plagiarising the work of the government and other institutions, but it does remind me to remind the House that some 10 years ago the Labor Party made allegations against a Liberal MP - I think he was the member for Cowan at the time - of plagiarism. Let me remind the Labor Party that they dubbed it shameful and a massive deceit. They even went so far as to move a motion in the House to have that member and the plagiarised work referred to a parliamentary committee. I wonder if the House remembers that. It begs the question whether the Labor Party takes the same view today about members plagiarising the work of others, as the member for Griffith has done, and whether the Leader of the Opposition will this time have the courage to move a motion to refer the member for Griffith and his plagiarism to a parliamentary committee.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, the government welcomes the views of stakeholders. There are a great many opinions and views being expressed, from within the industry especially, with regard to future arrangements for the single desk. The government has not endorsed anybody's view; we have heard many people. I am stopped often as I walk around the countryside, as my colleagues are. A lot of people come up to us; a lot of views are put to us officially and unofficially. We have said on any number of occasions that the government endorses the single desk so long as it is of benefit to wheat growers and is in the national interest. - It is not productive to speculate on what the changes might be in the future. We are waiting for the Cole report before doing so. In regard to Single Vision, can I remind the honourable member that it is an entity associated with the Grains Research and Development Corporation, it is funded out of levies and it is an industry body. Just as members of the Grains Council of Australia and the Grains Research and Development Corporation put views to me, so has Single Vision. I am not going to close my door to anybody. Instead, I will respect industry views, but the government has not concluded its own views.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. She and I, as representatives of electorates which have significant whale-watching industries, are very interested in the preservation of whales and in ensuring their wellbeing. This government has taken a world lead in promoting the conservation of whales. We have been very active in progressing whale conservation domestically and through international fora, particularly the International Whaling Commission. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, is currently visiting a range of Pacific nations seeking support for the conservation of whales in the run-up to the next meeting of the IWC, to be held in a couple of weeks time.There is a very real possibility that pro-whaling nations will have the majority at the upcoming IWC meeting and will seek resolutions to ultimately bring about a return to commercial whaling. We have to take this upcoming round of meetings very seriously. There is a risk that we could slip back on what has been achieved to date. So Senator Campbell's current mission is a very important one - to seek to shore up support for what has been achieved to date and, hopefully, take the matter further.The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative policies. In this instance the Labor Party do have some alternative views. They took little interest in whaling when they were in government. In fact, no Labor minister ever bothered to attend the International Whaling Commission meetings. Now their only solution to these problems is to take legal action - or similar responses. I was interested to note, however, that not all -  - Mr Speaker, I am responding to the element of the question that asked about alternative policies. I was referring to the fact that not all members of the Labor parties around the world follow the views of the opposition in relation to the value of legal action to endeavour to prevent the exploitation of whales. Indeed, New Zealand's delegate to the International Whaling Commission is a former New Zealand Labour Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Palmer. He also spent some time on the International Court of Justice. He was quoted recently as saying:We've been looking at the legal theories that are available against the Japanese for some months. There is no legal theory that is available that can prevent, in our view, the Japanese from doing what -    - It is clear that the Labor Party are barren when it comes to dealing with issues such as the conservation of whales. Their only policy has been rebutted conclusively by their colleagues in other parts of the world. It is time they got on and backed Senator Ian Campbell and the Australian government in its actions before the International Whaling Commission to try to preserve and protect this wonderful species.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and his obvious clear understanding of the issues, dating back a long time. I wonder who the minister was at the time, back in the 1980s, in Queensland. The issues that the honourable member raises are serious. They go to the heart of the frustration of Indigenous Australians when they cannot own their own homes or businesses. They see very little future for themselves under the DOGIT system that operates in Queensland and under the current native title laws that operate in the Northern Territory.I am very aware of the situation on Mornington Island. I went there recently and was saddened to learn from the mayor of the situation the council is in. It comes down to the fact there has been inadequate bureaucracy supporting those councils. The Auditor-General has found that they have in fact been dealing outside their financial capabilities. In fact, the Queensland government is looking at what it will do with the council. The reality is that no council is going to succeed if it does not have adequate bureaucracy supporting it. This government now has legislation before the House which provides that CEOs of organisations will be held responsible and will no longer be able to move from one council or one Aboriginal corporation to another and get away with maladministration.The situation on Mornington Island is deplorable. We have already moved with the state government, and I applaud the Queensland Minister for Energy and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy, John Mickel, for his interest in trying to rectify the situation. But the fact is that children on Mornington Island do not go to school and the parents have said to me - as I am sure they have said to the honourable member for Kennedy - that they want the law to apply equally to them as it would to white children anywhere else. That is, if their children do not go to school, the state government should act to ensure that they get them to school so they have an education and a real future. There is an intervention program in place, but we have to ensure that Indigenous people have the right to run their own property, that businesses can operate openly in the market economy, that children are forced to go to school, that they get an education and that the deplorable level of violence and gambling to great excess, which is putting children at risk, is dealt with. That is a commitment that we have in working with the state governments. The summit that we have notified everyone of will be carried out shortly, and it will go a long way to addressing many of the concerns that the honourable member for Kennedy has raised today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his interest in this matter. The Howard government is determined to ensure that all students across Australia receive quality schooling and nationally consistent standards. That is why we are focusing on literacy and numeracy testing across Australia on statements of learning in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 and a certificate of education for year 12. That is why we have invested a record $33 billion in schooling - a $12 billion increase over the last funding period.I am asked about alternative policies. Just when you thought that Labor could not get any lazier on policy development, I can announce to the House that, after a five-year absence, Knowledge Nation is back. Remember the noodle nation? In reannouncing this policy over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said:I see no good reason why the best bits of my Knowledge Nation can't have new life breathed into them.While the Leader of the Opposition is reheating his instant noodles, we on this side of the House want to know which bits are the best bits. Which bits is he going to leave out? Is he going to leave out schools, the environment or tourism? While members opposite cringe at the memory of Knowledge Nation - the noodle nation - they were not so polite when it was first introduced. I recall the member for Hotham - always very polite - in the understatement of the year, saying,  'I think we need to simplify it.' The member for Grayndler, in a confessional mode, said, 'I know some of you were really disappointed with the Knowledge Nation package.' Disappointed? The member for Melbourne said, 'The Knowledge Nation policy taken to the 2001 election was a prime example of what not to do next time.' But we had to hand it to Alan Ramsey from the Sydney Morning Herald to tell it as it is. He said:In one mad moment, with his incomprehensible bird's nest sketch of 23 circles and 40 train lines, Barry Jones made Kim Beazley's Knowledge Nation an instant national joke _Why would Labor bring back a discredited policy? Because, unlike the Howard government, they refuse to do the hard yards in policy development. They do not come up with any new ideas to take Australia forward, and that is why they have brought back from the ashes a failed and discredited policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for her interest. I know a number of members of the House are very interested in the issue of Iran, as was witnessed by the debate about the rights of the Baha'i people in Iran. I recall, for example, the speech by the member for Stirling very passionately in support of the Baha'i people.The government has been engaged in efforts in the broader international community to persuade Iran to comply with its international obligations through United Nations resolutions concerning its nuclear activities. I noticed yesterday, Washington time but overnight, that the Secretary of State of the United States, Condoleezza Rice, supported by the President himself, has announced that, as soon as Iran fully and verifiably suspends its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, the United States will join with the three European Union countries - France, Germany and the United Kingdom - in direct talks with Iran. This constitutes a very significant change in American policy in dealing with Iran. It is a change that we think is constructive, and it underscores the United States's commitment, which is shared by us, to try to find a diplomatic solution to the problem of Iran's nuclear program.Australia would urge Iran to use the opportunity that is now being presented by the United States to seriously consider a comprehensive package of initiatives and, in exchange for that package of initiatives, to reinstate a full and verifiable suspension on all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to comply fully with resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Security Council.Iran has an opportunity now, and it is a historic opportunity, to engage productively with the international community and to follow the guidelines laid down by multilateral United Nations institutions. Iran can choose that path and be rewarded by constructive and full engagement with the rest of the world - including with the United States, with which Iran has had no diplomatic relations since the 1970s - or Iran can turn its back on this offer. If it does so, Iran will be isolated and there is always the prospect that, either through the United Nations Security Council or on a bilateral basis, a series of sanctions, including financial sanctions, could be imposed on Iran.So we would urge Iran to take very seriously the offer that has been made by the United States administration, to embrace the offer that has been made by the Americans, to ensure that they fall into line with the mainstream of the international community and to suspend their enrichment and reprocessing programs so that negotiations of a constructive nature can take place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his previous life of service in the Australian Defence Force. At the moment across the world, in nine different theatres, the Australian government has approximately 3,600 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed. In deploying those men and women soldiers, sailors and air men and women, the government is very mindful and cognisant of the importance of the safety of our Defence Force personnel.We were reminded of that yesterday when an Australian light armoured vehicle, otherwise known as an ASLAV, suffered an explosion from what we believe to be an improvised explosive device, otherwise known as an IED. Across Iraq there are about 2,000 such incidents a month and about 80 a month currently in Afghanistan. It is likely that in Afghanistan, in particular, the use of IEDs will increase. There was in yesterday's incident relatively minor damage sustained to the ASLAV - to tyres and to a fan blade - and fortunately there was no injury at all sustained by the soldiers involved.On 21 May in Afghanistan, a long-range patrol vehicle was hit similarly with an IED. Significant damage was sustained by the vehicle and only very minor injuries were sustained by the soldier. Since September last year, five Australian soldiers have been injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. Four of those soldiers have returned to service with relatively minor injuries; the fifth, whilst sustaining a much more serious injury, I am advised will also return to service.Recognising the potential risks of IEDs and the importance of working with our allies, the Australian Defence Force, in early March this year, established the counter-IED task force. It is looking specifically at improving our purchase of equipment and technology, which give us a better understanding of IEDs and how to deal with them effectively. We also have sent two senior ADF officers to work on IEDs with the United States joint command and its task force. Also, the Explosive Hazards Centre has been established by the ADF to further improve the training of our soldiers and Defence Force personnel, before they are deployed, in the risks of IEDs and how to deal with them effectively.To date, Australia's Defence Force personnel, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, have suffered relatively few injuries compared to our coalition partners. We hope and pray that remains the case - and it is the case because of outstanding training; equipment, which indeed is the envy even of some of our allies; outstanding leadership by our officers; and also an Australian culture, which has a way of particularly wanting to understand the people with whom we work. But, as we see in the recent deployment into East Timor, it is also important to remember that there are significant risks associated with it. Australians should appreciate that the risk in Afghanistan, as we go through the summer there, and also in Iraq, as we move into the next phase of transferring security across to the Iraqi security forces entirely, will further increase the risk to our Defence Force personnel. I also take this opportunity to thank and congratulate again the Australian Defence Force personnel in East Timor and to ask all those Australians who so rightly support an independent and democratic East Timor to also ensure that the support of Iraqis living in a democratic and free society be considered no less important by Australia.</DOC>

They say they are interested in health, but it has been nine months without a question. I think Medibank Private are good guys - very good guys indeed.

But I say that they will do an even better job in the future than they have done in the past. I commend the privatisation to members opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. The member for Page and one of the companies in his electorate know first-hand the benefits of the government's trade policy agenda, particularly of the bilateral negotiations we have been engaged in in the free trade agreements. The member for Page knows of the benefits that have accrued to a company by the name of Permo-Drive, located on the North Coast of New South Wales, and the access that it has into the United States. It is doing business not just in the United States but also with the United States Army, with some new technology it has developed. This has come about in the last 12 months or so, ably supported by the member for Page.We are continuing to provide new and improved opportunities for exporters out of regional Australia. It is well known that one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exporting industries - it is one in four jobs in regional Australia and one in five across Australia, so it is more important in regional Australia. We are doing that on a couple of fronts. We are doing it on the multilateral front but also in our bilateral negotiations. I would like to give the House some examples of regional companies that have benefited from bilateral free trade agreements.A company in north Rockhampton, Dobinsons Spring and Suspension, which produces four-wheel drive accessories, has benefited from tariff reductions achieved in the free trade agreement with Thailand. Managing Director Glen Dobinson says, 'We're about 25 per cent cheaper to import than we were pre the Thai-Australia FTA; our Thai distributor says this drop has been a big factor in choosing us over our competitors.' That is an exporter of manufactured goods. I am glad that the member for Melbourne is present, as he likes to hear about the export of manufactured goods. That company is exporting into the Thai market against South-East Asian competitors.Bega Cheese down on the South Coast of New South Wales previously made no attempt to export its product into the United States, because of the high tariff barriers to its products. Now its national export business manager, Grahame Hocking, has said, 'It's only because the Australia-US FTA came into effect that we decided to enter the US market.' They are now exporting product into the US market because of that free trade agreement.The coalition government is focused on providing real market access opportunities through bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations. We have worked on that because we are in contact with regional Australia. I note yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had a much publicised meeting with the NFF. He has found another lobby group that does not just visit Canberra but actually has an office here. He has had a meeting with the NFF and he has said that they have a lot of commonalities in policy with the NFF. The NFF have some very good policies. They have a very good policy on trade, on workplace relations and on telecommunications. I wonder: does the Leader of the Opposition agree with those policies of the NFF?Most interestingly, after the discussion with the NFF, the Leader of the Opposition said he was going to set up a regional development task force and on the task force he was going to put the regional development spokesman, Simon Crean, the member for Hotham, and the member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor. One of the two people he is to put on the regional development task force he tried to get rid of and the other one he did get rid of. That is how much interest the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party show in regional Australia and in helping out regional Australians.</DOC>

 - I point out to the member for Lalor that competition and not government ownership is the best guarantee of good service. I make two further points. When members opposite had some sense of responsibility they actually believed in privatisation. They privatised the Commonwealth Bank and they privatised Qantas. They did that because they knew that privatisation could and would be good for those enterprises. I say it will be just as good for Medibank Private as it was for those organisations which the former Labor government privatised. The other point I make about private health insurance is that this government is the best friend that private health insurance has ever had. Most of all, thanks to the private health insurance rebate, premiums are $1,000 a year lower for the average family than they otherwise would be. The first thing that members opposite would do, if they got into government, would be to abolish the private health insurance rebate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler and acknowledge the importance of the area that he represents to Australia's national economy, including Gladstone and the associated industry in the area. Members of the House will be interested to know that, coming after growth of 13 per cent in the December quarter, business investment moderated in the March quarter, rising by 0.6 per cent, but is now 28.9 per cent higher over the year. This increase in business investment has been quite widespread. It has been led, of course, by the mining industry, where investment has been up 91 per cent over the last year. But investment in the manufacturing industry is up by 14 per cent, and investment in other industries, including wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, finance and insurance, construction and property and business services, has also increased by over 17 per cent over the same period.The good news is that today's capex figures show that investment intentions have again been upgraded for the balance of this year and early investment intentions for next financial year indicate that businesses are expecting investment to remain solid, albeit off a very high base. What we see is the Australian economy increasingly being led by business investment. We are seeing an improvement in our export performance at the same time as we see a moderation in relation to consumption.I have noticed, beginning with his reply to the budget, persistent claims from the Leader of the Opposition that Australia's economic performance is all the result of good luck and a minerals boom, which is funny because I remember, when the government announced its intention to balance the budget and repay Labor debt, the Labor Party said this would lead us into recession. When it did not, the Labor Party said the only reason the economy was growing was all the good work of Paul Keating. Now the Labor Party's latest mantra, led by the Leader of the Opposition, is, 'It's all the result of a mining boom.' Mining is a very important industry to Australia and contributes around four per cent of GDP. In his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition claimed:The minerals boom is putting an extra $160 billion ...  into this government's pockets.The whole company tax take over the next four years is only $280 billion. He claimed that $160 billion of that $280 billion was an increase from one industry alone which contributes about four per cent of GDP. I overlooked that claim because I knew his budget reply speech was inspired by Bob Ellis, and one should never give too much credibility to anything written by Bob Ellis. I noticed this claim was repeated in a speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Sydney on 26 May 2006. The Leader of the Opposition made this claim:The resources boom has channelled $160 billion in extra tax revenue straight into the Government's coffers.Bearing in mind that mining contributes four per cent of GDP, Treasury estimates are that increases in company tax from the mining industry could be in the order of $5 billion per annum - more like $16 billion over the next four years, not $160 billion, as has been claimed by the Leader of the Opposition. He is likely out by a factor of 10 in this claim. There is no rational basis at all for this claim, which he has serially repeated since budget night, that the mining boom has added $160 billion to government revenues over the last four years. It is indicative of his lazy attention to detail, his inability to grasp economic fact and his refusal to come to grips with those economic issues which are important for Australia. That budget reply was based on a falsehood. His Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce speech was wrong. I only hope that people did not have to pay to go and hear him. The Australian Labor Party should at the very least offer them their money back or pay them to come to future speeches by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I can only assume that the Leader of the Opposition's question time tactics totally collapsed today after the first failed question and therefore he is finally giving the member for Lalor her run in the park after nine months. - I can only assume that the Leader of the Opposition will not normally let her ask questions and Senate estimates will not ask those questions for her up there today. These issues are appropriately handled by departmental officials and she can ask all the questions she wants in Senate estimates. Let me make the simple point that privatisation was good for the Commonwealth Bank, good for Qantas and it will be good for Medibank Private. - The best guarantee of good service is competition, not government ownership. - On the fundamental point that she is trying to raise about premiums, let me point out that the average premium rise between 1983 and 1996 of 11 per cent a year was double the premium rise under this government. Labor has no credibility whatsoever on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I note that the unemployment rate in his electorate of La Trobe is 3.7 per cent, due to the good economic management of this government. In response to his question, it is a fact that the members opposite and the union movement continue to persist with their misleading and ridiculous claims that people will not be able to receive the occupational health and safety training provided by unions. As I have pointed out in this place on a number of occasions, occupational health and safety remains a state and territory responsibility. It seems that the only person these days who does not believe that, and is incapable of understanding that, is the Leader of the Opposition. First, we had the email from the member for Lilley, acting on the advice of the member for Perth, which said that this training would continue to be provided. Then yesterday we had the collective agreement entered into by Bill Shorten's union, the Australian Workers Union, which provided not only for occupational health and safety training but also that the workers would get paid leave to go and do that training.I came across some more information about this matter overnight in a document called the SafetyNet Journal. The SafetyNet Journal features in it each week a frequently asked question. This week's question is quite interesting. The question is:Does the 'WorkChoices' legislation mean a rep - a union rep - cannot attend a union OHS rep's course?The answer is:No, it does not.It goes on to explain:The changes to the Federal Workplace Relations Act ('WorkChoices') do NOT affect an OHS rep ... right to attend an initial/refresher course of their choice, including courses run by unions ...This is very interesting advice because the SafetyNet Journal is published by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. If you go to the Victorian Trades Hall web site and look up this week's question, you can get the answer to it. I note also that the journal says:If you have any questions or need help - the Leader of the Opposition might listen to this - with any OHS related issue, Ask Renata.I suggest he give Renata a ring before he makes foolish comments in future. This ridiculous situation, which the Leader of the Opposition maintains, just shows that he and some of the unions will stoop to any lengths in order to make a political point, including recently making a political stunt out of the death of a worker, something about which Neil Mitchell, in his column in the Herald Sun this morning, had this to say:We were tricked. This case was orchestrated and promoted by the CFMEU to further its cause. The union used the body of a dead member to embarrass John Howard. - The member ought to listen to this:It was a monstrous piece of black-hearted spin-doctoring and deserves to be treated with a new level of disgust by anybody with compassion or morality.I could not agree more. I table the article.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his interest in avian flu. I am aware of a report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation that some Asia-Pacific countries are underreporting cases of the deadly avian flu. We are keen that all countries in the region report cases quickly and accurately. We have been working since 2001 within APEC to assist: we have been training vets and animal health officials to improve their capacity to diagnose avian flu, we have been organising public meetings in villages and towns on proper handling procedures for livestock and poultry, we have been training district health administrators on what to do if there are outbreaks of avian flu and we have been providing antiviral medicines to Indonesia to help with avian flu outbreaks - and so the list goes on. We have been extremely active in this area. It is something we are cautious and concerned about.The honourable member for Fisher asked if there were any alternatives. I explained yesterday that, in a sense, there are not any alternatives. The member for Griffith, who has been vocal on this issue, has done something that we can only regard as extremely flattering, and that is to plagiarise our words - the words of the Minister for Health and Ageing - and the words of international organisations. Yesterday the member for Griffith told the parliament that he had lifted, word for word, sentences from other sources and had not attributed them. He said, though, that he had only lifted seven paragraphs. This is, by the way, for the interest of the House, in an article that is 13 paragraphs long and is signed 'Kevin Rudd'.The member for Griffith has committed what in academia is certainly a very serious offence. I wondered what the penalty would be for a student of - to use the name of the member's own electorate - Griffith University if that student were found to have plagiarised sentences and paragraphs without attributing them. The penalty at Griffith University is 'a fail grade for the course in which academic misconduct has occurred'. So, when it comes to avian flu, the great plagiariser is most certainly going to get a fail.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is no. I also point out to the Chief Opposition Whip that it is of course consistent with the tactics being used by the opposition in this matter to describe their employment conditions as being '2c an hour'. The reality is that 38 of the new staff employed at Mount Druitt were previously unemployed. While they were on the unemployment benefit, they received $205.30 a week. Under the AWA, these employees would receive $543.40 a week. So what I would call these AWAs are contracts of employment that provide remuneration increases of $338 a week for each of those employees. - What the Labor Party in this nation cannot and will not understand are the beliefs and the philosophies of a Labour Party leader who has won three general elections in the United Kingdom, and that is my good friend Tony Blair. On 9 September 1997, when addressing the Trades Union Congress in London, he told them that the old days of going out on strike and promoting class division were over. Let me quote his words. They should be written in stone for every member of the Australian Labor Party. He said:You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place _ - The member for Chifley knows better than anybody in this parliament that the unemployment level, despite the great improvement around the nation, is higher in his electorate and we have done something for the people of his electorate. We have, in the words of Tony Blair, given them 'the chance of a job'. I will always be proud of policies that give to the men and women of Western Sydney the chance of a job. That is why, in the last election campaign when I spoke to the people of Western Sydney in launching the government campaign, the proudest boast I made in appearing to them and asking for re-election of the members representing those seats was that, in the time we had been in government, we had provided to the people of Western Sydney lower taxes, lower interest rates, lower unemployment rates and chances of work that no Labor government could ever dream of, let alone implement. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question on health. Given that for nine months there were no questions on health from the opposition, thank God people on this side are still interested in this important topic. The Howard government is proud of Medicare. We are very proud of Medicare and that is why we are always looking for new ways to make a good system work even better. Amongst other things, the government's bulk-billing incentives have driven GP bulk-billing rates for children and people in country areas -  - Does he object to bulk-billing rates going up? - There are no questions from the opposition on bulk-billing rates, and that is because this government has pushed GP bulk-billing rates for children and people in country areas to record highs. There has been a -  - 20 per cent increase in bulk-billing rates in Braddon. And you will hear it again, I say to the Leader of the Opposition. You will hear this again - and you deserve to hear it, because this government is doing the right thing by Medicare. - No, I have not. - I am just very surprised that members opposite do not want to hear the good news about Medicare, thanks to the policies of this government. They have always claimed to be the party of Medicare, and what they object to is the fact that this government has done more for Medicare than any other government in Australia's history. We will keep talking about our achievements with Medicare, because we believe in it and we have done the right thing by it. Not only have bulk-billing rates gone up but also primary health care is improving. Almost one million Australians now have GP management plans, thanks to the policies of this government. Almost a quarter of a million Australians in the last 12 months have enjoyed allied health professional care, thanks to the policies of this government. Almost $1 billion in new money is being spent on medical research, thanks to the policies of this government. And look at him: he yawns and he leans back. These things matter to the Australian people because today's research is tomorrow's new medicines and tomorrow's new medical treatment - and these things are important. And we will keep talking about them.I have been asked about alternative policies, and I regret to inform the House that, since 3 May, Labor has officially been a health-policy-free zone. That was the day when the Leader of the Opposition finally abolished the member for Lalor's pet policy of Medicare Gold. Let me say it takes a lot of guts for Mr Twenty-Five Per Cent to scrap the policy of Madam Thirty-One Per Cent; nevertheless, he has finally done it -  -  - I do not like to see the Leader of the Opposition as frustrated as he is, so let me conclude on this point. The member for Lalor, the shadow minister for health - three years she has had in that position - came up with one policy, Medicare Gold, and it has now been officially scrapped by her own peers.</DOC>

 - The only advice that I would give to those firms is the advice that I give to firms throughout Australia, and that is: take proper advantage of the wonderful economic condition created by the policies of this government. The other bit of advice I would give them is: take no notice of the pessimistic doomsayers of the Australian Labor Party. They were on about this business of driving down wages 10 years ago. Ten years on, what has happened? Wages have gone up by 16.8 per cent in real terms. The third piece of advice I would give to the businesses in Mount Druitt and to the businesses of Australia is this: if you want low wages and high unemployment, vote Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I acknowledge his deep interest in this issue. The coalition is determined to raise standards in education across the country. We believe that parents and students have a right to the highest educational standards possible wherever they may live, wherever they may receive their education. That is why, in considering a year 12 certificate of education, we have commissioned a comparative study into curriculum content across the country, including in English, Australian history, maths, science, physics and chem.I am asked about alternative policies and I can report to the House that over in the west the state Labor government is seeking to introduce an outcomes based education regime. The implementation of this OBE regime has been nothing short of a debacle. It has been an absolute disgrace. Labor has managed to alienate virtually every stakeholder group, from parents and teachers to the State School Teachers Union of WA, the Western Australian Council of State School Organisations, the Independent Education Union, the Association of Independent Schools of WA, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and the WA College of Teaching. So teachers, parents, students, academics and educators are calling on state Labor to stop this madness.Through a lack of resources, a lack of time and a lack of preparation, students in Western Australia are facing English courses with no text, history courses with no dates and music courses with no instruments. We on this side of the House stand with the parents, the students and the unions in calling on state Labor to delay the implementation of this OBE regime. And what do we hear from the federal Labor members from Western Australia - the member for Cowan, the member for Fremantle, the member for Swan, the member for Perth and the member for Brand, who wants to be the education Prime Minister? We have heard not a word about this debacle. I think it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to show some leadership, stand up for the students in his state and call upon his state Labor colleagues to delay the implementation in the interests of students in his home state. - </DOC>

 - The answer to that question is no. But, if you want some statements about contempt for the low paid and contempt for the unemployed, can I take the House back only to 6 May 1993. Flush with having deceived the Australian public in the infamous election of 1993 with a dishonest campaign against the introduction of a GST, when interviewed on The 7.30 Report, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training had this to say -  - in response to a question. The interviewer said: 'So this group' - namely the unemployed -  - 'are being told in their 20s by society effectively, 'You're the losers. Go to the scrap heap'.' In reply, the person being interviewed had this to say, 'Well, for those who haven't made it into work, who are among the long-term unemployed, that is a reasonable statement.' - This reply by the then minister for employment but now Leader of the Opposition throws a spotlight, dare I say, onto the contempt that Labor has always had for the unemployed in this country. - No. He's got a point of order. The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.  - But that remark by the Leader of the Opposition, in his then manifestation, was only the half of it because he then went on to say, on 30 June 1993, at the National Press Club:Anything like full employment, however defined, will be desperately difficult to recapture in this country. - Mr Speaker, my answer is about the minimum wage that a million Australians received in the early 1990s and that minimum wage was the dole. That is very relevant to the policies of this government. Unlike the Labor Party, we do not regard somebody who, in the height of a recession induced by failed policies, cannot get a job as being on the scrapheap. -  The member for Perth then left the chamber.  -  - Mr Speaker, unlike the Australian Labor Party -  The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 - Mr Speaker, I would point out to the Chief Opposition Whip there is no low pay commission. The only time in the last 25 years this nation has needed a low pay commission was when Labor was last in power, to look after the interests of those people whom the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to leave on the scrapheap. Labor has never really cared about the unemployed in this country, and for the first time in a generation this country has a government that cares about the unemployed of Australia. I am proud of the way in which we have brought the unemployment rate down; I am proud of the job opportunities we have given to the men and women of Australia, and the Labor Party has no alternatives other than misrepresentation. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. As he and many will know, last Thursday was a great day for the workers of Australia. Last Thursday saw the unemployment rate in this country fall below five per cent for the first time since 1976. We recorded a magnificently low unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent - and this despite the fact that the workforce participation rate had increased. This was a fall in unemployment in the face of a greater number of people looking for work and being more confident about getting work than virtually at any time over the last 40 or 50 years. This is a reminder that good economic policy reforms over a period of time ultimately produce great economic dividends. The low unemployment of today is a product of yesterday's reforms. The still lower unemployment of tomorrow will be a product of today's reforms. There is not much doubt that in Australian politics at the present time only one party stands for reform, and that is the coalition parties. Only the Liberal and National parties have the courage to make the reforms that are necessary to guarantee that, as the years go by, unemployment not only will remain where it is now but hopefully will go even lower.When I heard the ABS figures, my mind went back almost 10 years to a speech made by the then opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the then member for Canberra, now the member for Fraser. When the message conveying to the House that the industrial relations legislation of 1996, in its amended form, had come back from the Senate, the then member for Canberra, speaking on behalf of the opposition, criticised the legislation. He called it 'flawed and unfair' and said that it left many bad features intact. He said it left a bill that undermined the three pillars of the Australian industrial relations system. But, interestingly, he asked a series of questions. No doubt he intended those questions, 10 years ago, to be rhetorical, but nonetheless he asked them. The first question he asked, in November 1996, was:Will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three-year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime?The second question he asked was:Perhaps more importantly, will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime than there were in the last term of the parliament? Particularly, will there be more jobs created in small business?Everybody remembers the doomsday talk by the then Leader of the Opposition - he is still the Leader of the Opposition - and the then industrial relations spokesman. They said that the world was going to come to an end and the sky would fall in. We all know that the only thing that has fallen in the last 10 years is the level of unemployment; it has more than halved under this government. I can also inform the member that not only has the unemployment rate more than halved under this government but the ABS figures released last week for the March quarter show that 81 per cent fewer working days were lost in the March quarter of 2006 than in the March quarter of 1996.So that is the answer to the question posed by the then member for Canberra almost 10 years ago, when he was trying to whip the House into a frenzy. He was saying that if we passed the legislation Armageddon would come, the world would suffer great pestilence and desolation, there would be riots in the streets and murders in the homes and you would have to maintain the barricades - and so he went on. Isn't that all very familiar? - Mr Speaker, these unemployment figures are so terrific, I ought to be given double time! Can I simply conclude my response by saying this: you warned in the past -  -  - They said the world was going to come to an end 10 years ago. Ten years on there is record low unemployment, record low industrial disputation, strong prosperity and the Treasurer being invited on behalf of Australia to go to St Petersburg not to talk about the alternative industrial relations policy of the Labor Party but to talk about the economic strength of Australia due to the policies of this government.</DOC>

 - I have not misled the public. I'll tell you what: he has -  -  - I have not misled the public. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the question he has to answer is: why does he want to destroy the living standards of those hundreds of thousands of aspirational Australians on Australian workplace agreements?</DOC>

 - There is nothing ironic about the fact that real wages have gone up under this government by 16.8 per cent. There is nothing ironic about the fact that unemployment -  -  - has fallen to a 30-year low. One of the things that has underpinned this remarkable performance by the Australian economy has been the industrial relations reforms of this government. Those reforms of 10 years ago, which the Labor Party said would destroy the living standards of Australia, have enhanced the living standards of Australia. One of the features is of course the introduction of Australian workplace agreements - those same workplace agreements that the Leader of the Opposition said in October last year that you could not get rid of. Yet eight months later the Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to the ALP conference in Sydney at the weekend, said that, if he became Prime Minister, he would get rid of Australian workplace agreements. In the process he is committing himself to reducing the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. He is attacking the aspirational, the workers of the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. He is taking on the hopes and the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of people in this country who want to negotiate free of union interference, who do not believe they need a union supervisor beside them to look after their own best interests. The Labor Party's policy announced at the weekend is all about handing back total control of Australia's industrial relations system to the trade union movement of this country. The Leader of the Opposition's logic is that a movement that has only 20 per cent of the participants in the private sector of the Australian workforce should control 100 per cent of the deals that are made between Australian workers and their employers.The real explanation for the decision that was announced by the Leader of the Opposition is not job security for Australians but job security for the Leader of the Opposition. He should have taken the advice of his highly successful British counterpart, Tony Blair, the leader of the British Labour Party, in a famous speech to the British Trades Union Congress on 9 September 1997. I have quoted that speech before, but I think it is worth quoting again. He famously said:You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place ...That is not an attitude that the Leader of the Opposition has ever been particularly interested in, because he has never displayed a great deal of interest in the unemployed. One of the most revealing interviews of his life was given on The 7.30 Report on 6 May 1993, when unemployment had reached almost 11 per cent and he was the minister for employment. The interviewer had this to say:So this group - the unemployed - are being told, in their twenties, by society, effectively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap.The Leader of the Opposition said in reply:Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement.In other words, with 11 per cent unemployed, with his government having been in power for 10 years, he cared not a jot about the unemployed. He does not care about the unemployed now. He did not care about them then. Not caring about the unemployed was bad enough, but at the weekend he added another group he does not care about: the strivers and the aspirational people of Australia - the people who want to do better, the people who want to work harder. They want rewards for that hard work and they want to make their own decisions about their future. I have another piece of advice for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is to be found in the same speech made by Mr Tony Blair to the Trades Union Congress on 9 September 1997. As I read this part of the speech, I thought of the New South Wales ALP conference. This is what Mr Blair had to say:The old ways of the Labour Party were the resolutionists, the committee rooms, the fixing and the small groups trying to run the show.That is what happened at the weekend. There was a meeting between Mr Beazley and Mr Robertson of Unions NSW, and out of that came the big flip-flop of the Leader of the Opposition that has resulted in his absurd attack on the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of Australians.</DOC>

 - As the member for Perth knows, those same figures confirm that there have been very significant wage increases over and above the awards under all of those things. The member for Perth, like the Leader of the Opposition, is very good in his selective quotation. - But nothing can alter the fact that 10 years ago you said the same thing; 10 years ago you said that living standards were going to fall and 10 years later Australians are better off than they have ever been. The problem that the opposition have is that they hate the prosperity of today's Australians. They resent the fact that it is this government that has delivered unparalleled prosperity to working Australians. They resent the fact that the very hardworking aspirational Australians are the very people who rejected you in 2001, who rejected you in 2004 and, the way you are carrying on, who will reject you in even greater measure the next time they have an opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. It is a well-known statistic that during the course of the last 10 or so years Australia's exports have increased from $99 billion to $177 billion. There have been record exports of beef, lamb, iron ore and coal - all exports and horticultural products coming from the member for Mallee's electorate and coming out of regional Australia. That is the powerhouse of Australian exporting.The coalition government have undertaken some significant industrial relations reforms in the 10 years since we have been in office, and none more important than the reforms of 10 years ago, particularly the waterfront reform that took place around that time. We were languishing in international competitiveness scales at an average of 17 lifts of 20-foot equivalent containers per hour on our waterfront. We were being told we could not do any better, that it was impossible to improve. This government had the backbone to take on the challenge of reforming the waterfront, and today that 17 lifts an hour has moved to 28 lifts an hour. It has been one of the most important reforms. It has improved the efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's export industries.Our other workplace reforms during our term of office have helped to generate new jobs. Our exporting industries generate one in four jobs in regional Australia and one in five jobs across Australia. Our workplace relations reforms have helped create 1.8 million new jobs in Australia. Last week unemployment fell to 4.9 per cent in Australia, which is something that the Labor Party, when they were in office, could only dream about, let alone ever achieve. Over the weekend, we saw a new-found policy dimension of the Leader of the Opposition. He is going to completely abolish Australian workplace agreements where, on average, people on workplace AWAs are earning more today than people on certified agreements do.At the end of last year, I heard an interesting case in point. The Leader of the Opposition should listen to this, because this is the effect his policies are going to have on one of Australia's major export industries. Earlier this year or late last year, I visited Hamersley Iron, run by Rio Tinto in the Pilbara. The entire workforce is on individual workplace agreements. Twenty years ago, the productivity in that industry was 10,000 tonnes of iron ore per full-time employee. Today it is 41,000 tonnes. That entire workforce is very happy with the arrangements they have today, which have been negotiated between the company and the individual employees - and the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip this up.He has picked up a policy from the playbook of the former member for Werriwa. The former member for Werriwa went to Western Australia in 2004 and told the mining industry about it, and they were aghast. Now the Leader of the Opposition has picked up this policy, because his prospects of staying on as Leader of the Opposition are shortening - to put it mildly. He has picked up this policy of Mark Latham's and he is showing a distinct lack of judgment, as he did in the lead-up to the 2004 election when he said that Mark Latham was ready to be Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - In relation to the lady referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, I am not aware, and nor could I be expected to be, of the individual employment circumstances of the thousands of Australians -  -  - no matter what the employment position may be of the circumstances of individuals, because there are thousands of people who go in and out of jobs every week. If those who sit opposite and yell their slogans stopped for a moment, they would understand that. I cannot and will not even attempt, because I am not in possession of the facts, to pass a judgment on the circumstances of that lady's position.What I am in a position to do, and to do with some authority, is to tell the parliament - and through the parliament, the Australian people - the aggregate jobs position under this government compared with the aggregate jobs position under the alternative government. I can tell the Australian people that unemployment has reached a 30-year low. -  - I can tell the Australian people that 1.8 million new jobs have been created by the coalition. I can tell the Australian people that real wages of Australian workers -  -  - Mr Speaker, I was asked a question about employment conditions in Australia, and I am telling the parliament about them. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit opposite that real wages of Australian workers -  - I was also asked about unfair dismissal laws. I would say that, if the unfair dismissal regime we now have in Australia had obtained over the last 10 years, we would now have an even lower rate of unemployment.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to outline for the Ryan electorate what is happening with the national economy. The national accounts were released for the March quarter last week, and they showed that growth in Australia has kicked up, growing 0.9 per cent for the March quarter and 3.1 per cent through the year, which is a significant tick-up. Household consumption was moderate, and national growth was led by business investment. New machinery and equipment investment grew by 1.5 per cent and is 27.1 per cent higher through the year. Although private engineering construction fell in March, it remains 13.8 per cent higher through the year. Exports grew by 0.5 per cent, whilst imports grew by only 0.4 per cent. As a consequence of that, net exports did not detract from growth.We are now seeing the Australian economy adjusting out of what was unsustainable housing investment and into business investment and we are beginning to see increasing export volumes. The good news about the growth in the national economy is that new jobs continue to be created, with 56,000 new persons given jobs in the month of May. All members of the House will welcome the fact that new jobs were created in the month of May. Over the last year, 172,000 new jobs have been created. I am asked about threats to the economy. - I am asked what threats there are to the economy. Obviously there are threats from international factors such as oil prices, which are not good for the economy, but the greatest threat to the Australian economy domestically - in Ryan! - would be the election of the Leader of the Opposition. I can think of nothing that could be worse for the Australian economy than Kim Beazley being in a position of influence. Unemployment went below five per cent last week, and the Leader of the Opposition was nowhere to be seen. As a journalist in the Australian recorded:Australia records its lowest unemployment rate in 30 years and poor old Kim Beazley is worrying about temporary immigrants undermining union rorts.The journalist said:Beazley is the leaf blower of Australian politics ... - I am in the process of explaining threats to the Australian economy. There could be no greater threat to the Australian economy than the Leader of the Opposition being in a position of influence. As the journalist recorded in the Australian on Friday:Beazley is the leaf blower of Australian politics - lots of noise but all that comes out is hot air.He is not just a normal leaf blower. He is not an economic four-cylinder leaf blower; he is a V8 turbocharged double-exhaust leaf blower. There is no end to the leaf blowing and the hot air that comes out as a consequence.All around the world countries are now trying to move to improved industrial relations systems and Australia, amongst them, is making its labour market more flexible. - In opposition to all of the international experience, one political party stands against a more deregulated, flexible industrial relations system - the Australian Labor Party, because of its commitment to the socialist objective. - Absolutely: about the dangers of not proceeding with industrial relations reform. The dangers of not proceeding with industrial relations reform will involve fewer jobs, at lower wages -  - Nothing could be more important for Australia, as we go into the 21st century, than that we have a flexible economy that is able to adjust to international shocks; one where, in relation to industrial relations, we have the ability to contract between employers and employees; where there is flexibility in the workplace; and where the influence of trade unions being able to dictate, out of political objectives, is not enforced - as the Leader of the Opposition, paying tribute to his political masters, wants to do. This country needs a flexible industrial relations system; it does not need a return to the 20th and sometimes the 19th century, going backwards under the anti-reform party, the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I have not seen or been briefed on that particular presentation, but I have seen and been briefed on the Bureau of Statistics, which publishes a survey every two years of employee earnings and hours. The results from the most recent survey, conducted in mid-2004, became available earlier this year. This survey allows a comparison to be made between the earnings of individuals on AWAs and those on registered collective agreements.The published data showed that the average weekly total earnings of employees working under AWAs are on average 13 per cent higher than for those employees covered by certified agreements. Both managerial and non-managerial employees on AWAs have higher average total earnings than equivalent employees on certified agreements. Managerial employees on AWAs have earnings that are on average 19 per cent higher than those on collective agreements. The earnings of non-managerial employees on AWAs are on average five per cent higher than those on collective agreements. These comparisons are made on the basis of average weekly total earnings as opposed to ordinary time earnings. It is entirely appropriate to make the comparison as traditional rigid employment categories, such as full time, part time and casual, are less common in AWAs, where a premium is placed on flexibility. A focus on weekly take-home pay recognises that many employees on AWAs enjoy greater flexibility in the hours they work.I have a message for the people of Australia who are enjoying the enhanced benefits of AWAs: the Leader of the Opposition is after your aspirational prosperity. The Leader of the Opposition wants to dent your aspirational spirit. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip away the incentives now available to you under the system. The Leader of the Opposition wants to take you back to the backwoods of industrial relations in this country, to a system that presided over more than a million Australians being without a job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, according to the official Australian Bureau of Statistics data, employees on Australian workplace agreements earn, on average, 13 per cent more than employees covered by certified agreements. If you compare those individuals on AWAs with those on the instrument of choice of the Labor Party, the award, those on AWAs earn, on average, 100 per cent more than those who are on awards.The member for Fisher asked me whether there are any threats to these benefits which are enjoyed by Australians on individual agreements. There are indeed threats, and those threats come from the labour movement in Australia, who want to abolish Australian workplace agreements, who want to rip away, from these Australians who are better off, those benefits that they have obtained under Australian workplace agreements.Of course, in return for $50 million worth of funding from the unions over the last 10 years to the Australian Labor Party, we had this craven caving in by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend, a caving in to the unions in Australia which has been almost universally condemned in the media today. For example, in the Australian, Matthew Stevens says, and the headline is, 'Beazley bombs as economic manager'. In another article in the Australian, Peter Switzer -  -  - They don't like it, do they, Mr Speaker? The headline is 'Beazley backs wrong horse in industrial stakes'. What about the Daily Telegraph, with 'Sop to the unions'? Or there is the Australian's editorial, which says, 'Beazley's backflip: The Labor leader's populist move on AWAs is poor policy'. The Financial Review, also on the same theme, says, 'Beazley goes back to the '50s'. The Courier Mail -  -  - You don't like to hear it, do you?Ministers have often been advised that, should a question require a lengthy response, the proper procedure is for the Minister to state that fact and to seek leave to make a statement after Question Time.Mr Speaker, we would be willing to accommodate the minister after question time, and I would ask you to suggest that to him. - I was asked about threats, and these threats have been highlighted in almost every major newspaper in Australia today. The Advertiser from Adelaide has 'Beazley fires wide of a sitting duck'; the West Australian newspaper, from the Leader of the Opposition's own state, 'Beazley plans return to an unwanted past'; and the Herald Sun, in Melbourne, 'Beazley steps backwards'. But of course it was one above all that really hit the mark, and that was the Sydney Morning Herald, with 'Beazley's real agenda: his job'.Every major newspaper in Australia has condemned this weak response by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend - simply doing their bidding in return for $50 million from the unions in Australia. What is next? Have we got the secret accord coming along? Already we have the union leaders in New South Wales, John Robertson and the like, gloating that the Leader of the Opposition can now keep his job - as if it was a gift of the union bosses in Australia that the Leader of the Opposition can keep his job.In relation to these matters, as the Prime Minister said, the reality for Australians is this: a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate announced last week, the first time in 30 years that unemployment has gone under five per cent in Australia. What we had under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the employment minister, was 11 per cent unemployment -  - This side of the parliament is interested in jobs for all Australians. That is why we put in place economic reforms that have driven down the unemployment rate from the 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment to 4.9 per cent. That is why this side of the parliament has seen a 16.8 per cent increase in real wages compared to 1.2 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. There could be no more stark contrast in relation to this matter, and a government interested in - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The G8 finance ministers met in St Petersburg over the weekend. -  - There were not many socialists. The Russians are much more pro-enterprise than the Australian Labor Party, I can tell you. One of the things the Russians want to do is to promote private enterprise and flexible wage bargaining. If I were the member for Lilley, I would not head for Russia; Cuba is more your bag, my friend. To go back to St Petersburg, the G7 finance ministers represent the developed economies of the world. Together with Russia they represent the G8. The G8 finance ministers met in St Petersburg over the weekend and had two topics of conversation, principally. The first was good governance in public finance, on which Australia was asked to lead the discussion. None of the G8 countries has a history of budget surpluses that matches Australia's and none of them has retired all of their net debt. Australia's experience was considered of sufficient interest for Australia to be asked to lead the discussion in St Petersburg.Finance ministers from the developed economies of the world were particularly interested in intergenerational reporting, something else which Australia pioneered with our first Intergenerational report in 2002, and our Charter of Budget Honesty, which provides for accounting against external standards and also statements of sensitivities and risks. The G8 ministers noted in their communique the importance of good governance in public finance and pledged to work at an international level to improve standards both for developed and developing economies.The second topic of discussion amongst the G8 ministers in St Petersburg this weekend concerned the topic of energy security, which is of interest to all countries around the globe. Russia, of course, is a massive oil exporter, but, to various degrees, the G7 countries are net oil importers. All the G7 countries are struggling with high gasoline or petrol prices. A discussion took place in relation to the measures which could be taken on a global scale to improve prices for consumers and to take the risk out of the global economy which high gasoline or petrol prices represent.It was agreed between the ministers that facilitating further private investment, both from consuming and producing countries in the oil business, was very important. For many of the large oil producers of the world this will mean liberalising foreign investment regimes, giving certainty of title and allowing technical expertise to be brought in to increase the take from fields which hitherto may have been thought unproductive or uneconomic but which can be returned to, as well as investment in new fields. Ministers agreed that, whilst not without its risks, the outlook for the global economy remains a positive one, particularly whilst the industrialisation which is occurring in China continues to lead global growth. They noted the importance of keeping a watch on inflation and of being vigilant to any inflationary price movements that might get into the general economy as a second-round effect from oil prices or finance.Australia is not a member of the G8. It is the first time we have ever been invited to a G8 summit. This was an invitation which was extended to Australia principally so that it could share its experience in relation to good governance in public finance. But Australia is also chairing the group of developed and developing nations known as the G20. The annual conference of that group will be held in Melbourne, Australia, in November. It has become an important forum for the reform of the IMF and the World Bank. The managing director of the IMF is visiting Australia today and tomorrow. Our discussions will continue on making those global financial institutions more representative, particularly of the growing Asian economies, and more accountable to national governments for the work they do. I expect that these will be positive discussions with positive progress to be reported in the course of this year.</DOC>

 - I am not personally aware of the circumstances of that, but it is the case that the unfair dismissal laws have been changed and that they no longer apply to firms that employ fewer than 100 people. The government has not endeavoured at any time to disguise that fact. The view is taken by this government that, whilst laws relating to unlawful termination should be maintained - and I will come to that in a moment by way of supplementing, if I may, an earlier answer I gave in response to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition - it is in the interests of flexibility and greater employment in this country that the unfair dismissal laws should no longer apply to firms employing fewer than 100 people, and we have never made any secret of that fact. In fact, at the last election when we talked about unfair dismissal laws we did not put any statistical limit on the change we had in mind. But earlier in question time I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition. I think it was about a lady by the name of Karen Palmer, a machine operator at Greer Industries. - I was asked about Karen Palmer, a machine operator at Greer Industries. Since being asked that question I have been provided with some information about this, and I would like to share it with the House. Whilst I do not regard this to be an exhaustive statement of the facts, what I have been informed is this: the employee may have been dismissed in connection with her being temporarily absent from work due to illness or injury. If so, that could amount to an unlawful termination of employment, and the Workplace Relations Act makes it unlawful for an employer to dismiss an employee for one or more discriminatory reasons. One of the prohibited reasons for termination is temporary absence from work because of illness or injury. I understand that a union is pursuing a claim about unlawful termination of employment in this matter. If the employee makes a claim for unlawful termination, that person will be entitled to an order from the court unless the employer can prove - in other words, the onus is reversed - that the termination was for a reason that was not unlawful. The government put in place an unlawful termination scheme where people considering whether to proceed to a court can receive up to $4,000 worth of legal assistance on the merits of their claim.The Office of Workplace Services have advised that they are currently examining the matter. It is interesting that, on the basis of this information, a claim for unlawful termination by a union is apparently either on foot or in contemplation. I do not recall, in the substance of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, any reference to unlawful termination. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition knew that and he did not want to disclose it to the House. - </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and the interest that he has shown. The United Nations has been playing and will play a key role in East Timor's future, but it does need to move quickly to play its part to help East Timor through the current crisis and, importantly, beyond that crisis. The Security Council's mandate for the present mission - UNOTIL, as it is known - expires on 20 June, and we support a short extension of that mandate by a period of a month or two. Any successor mission should focus on areas where the United Nations can be particularly helpful - first of all, in assisting the East Timorese with the process of reconciliation and, secondly, in helping with the improvement of the overall quality of governance in East Timor. Thirdly, we believe that there will be a need for international police to remain in East Timor for some time, both in helping to stand up the East Timorese police, the PNTL, and also to assist with overall policing duties. That work would best be done under the auspices of the United Nations. We would be looking at perhaps around 500 international police operating in East Timor under the umbrella of the United Nations.The United Nations can play a key role. They can also play a role in assisting the East Timorese, should the East Timorese wish, to investigate allegations in East Timor, for example. They have been asked by the East Timorese to investigate the killing of East Timorese police last month in tragic circumstances, and Australian police are helping with the forensics of that. The United Nations might be able to assist with other inquiries, should the East Timor government wish to ask them to pursue those inquiries - for example, in relation to allegations concerning certain politicians in East Timor.But let me make this final point about what the United Nations can do, what Australia can do and what Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal can do: at the end of the day, the East Timorese are responsible themselves for East Timor. They are responsible for the management and the running of their country - and no amount of commentary and criticism of the United Nations, of Australia, Portugal, Malaysia or whoever it may be is a substitute for the East Timorese taking responsibility for their own destiny and their own country. If there are differences between East Timor's politicians, it is for those politicians to resolve those differences in their national interest. It is not good enough to ask the international community to solve those differences. They must learn to solve these problems amongst themselves, just as when we have differences in this country we are able to resolve those in our own way in the national interest.It is very important that the international community sends that message to the East Timorese. Certainly, we are prepared to help them if things go seriously awry and there are useful ways we can help - that is what we are doing now - but that is no substitute for the East Timorese taking responsibility for their own country and their own destiny.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is that the reference made, which is apparently in 4.4 on page 22, was entirely correct and entirely consistent with what has occurred. I do not know what is in the workplace agreement to which the honourable member refers. I think I will look at it myself, if she wants to send it to me, and then I might be able to enlighten the House even more.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I know how concerned he is to ensure that we do get enough doctors and nurses in country areas. I can inform him and the House that this government is funding the largest expansion of medical and nurse training places in Australia's history. Under policies already in place the number of medical graduates will increase by 60 per cent from 1,300 last year to 2,100 by the year 2011. In addition, the government has recently committed an additional $250 million to provide an extra 460 medical school places a year and up to 1,000 additional nurse training places a year. The government wants to see Australian communities served by Australian doctors, but in the short term, unfortunately, it is important that we make full use of suitably qualified overseas trained doctors to serve our communities, particularly in country areas.Mostly they come into Australia under section 457 temporary skilled migration visas. That is how they get here. But they will not get here if the Leader of the Opposition has his way, because last week he was asked about these section 457 temporary skilled migration visas and he said:Well, Federal Labor can get into office and block it.He would block the visa under which so many doctors and nurses are coming into Australia. For instance, in the 10 months to the end of April, these visas were issued to 1,704 doctors, 2,555 nurses and 1,150 other health professionals. The largest user of these visas was not union-busting Perth builders but the New South Wales Department of Health. It is the largest single user of 457 visas in this country. So, if the Leader of the Opposition has his way, communities in Australia, especially the country communities of Australia, will be short more than 5,000 health professionals. That is 5,000 doctors and nurses that they now have that this person here wants to expel. What we have is a Leader of the Opposition who is far more interested in saving his own job than he is in delivering services to the Australian people. What he needs to do is carefully explain how he will stop the foreigners he does not like coming in while letting the foreigners we still need come into this country.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition brings us back to AWAs. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that, because his promise to abolish AWAs is a promise that he disavowed only eight months ago. What the Australian people want to know is what happened between that interview he gave on television in October of last year and the weekend. I think he got mugged by a bit of reality, and the reality is pronounced 'New South Wales unions'. John Robertson and his merry men said to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Kimbo, if you don't front up and abolish AWAs, we're going to roll you.' That is basically what happened. Everybody in this building knows that the Leader of the Opposition's powerbase is the New South Wales Right and everyone knows that his moment of truth was in fact the New South Wales ALP conference. What else would explain a policy which is against the economic interests of this country? What else would explain a policy that will threaten the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australians? Because that is what is involved here. AWAs are the preferred employment instrument of aspirational Australians. The aspirational people of this country want AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition has declared an open fronted attack on aspirational Australians. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he has betrayed by this decision a total misunderstanding of the hopes and the aspirations of Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and note her interest in this matter. The Australian government is providing some $33 billion for schools across Australia over the 2005-08 period. That is a $12 billion increase on the last funding period. In addition, we are investing some $1 billion under the Investing in Our Schools program to make up for the failure of state and territory governments to properly capitalise on the requirements of schools for things such as playground equipment, classrooms and the like, $700 million of that going to state government schools. This year alone the Australian government is investing some $49.2 million in recurrent funding in the ACT and under the Investing in Our Schools program we have already provided some $7.5 million over recent months to government schools in the ACT.I am asked about alternative policies. It seems that the Labor Chief Minister's idea of an education policy is to put the future of young Canberrans in jeopardy by closing some 39 government schools. Through gross mismanagement of the Canberra economy, 39 schools are being closed. It is a disgrace that parents, students and teachers were not notified that 39 government schools are being closed in the ACT. I want to know how Jon Stanhope intends to account to Commonwealth taxpayers for the $7.5 million that has already been paid in recent months under the Investing in Our Schools program to schools that he intends to close. I will ask him: how does he account to the Commonwealth taxpayers for that $7.5 million? Not only is he ruining the Canberra economy but he is burning up Commonwealth taxpayers' funds. The member for Canberra, the member for Fraser and the Leader of the Opposition, as Jon Stanhope's mentor, ought to be ashamed that a Labor colleague is closing government schools in the name of an education policy. Not only has he ruined the Canberra economy but he is ruining the Canberra education system and they ought to condemn him for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Watson for his question. The purpose of this legislation is to further enhance the extremely successful border protection arrangements that this country has in place. If it had not been for the border protection policies of this government, unauthorised arrivals would by now have reached horrendous proportions. They were running into their thousands in 2001 -  - and despite the unwillingness of the Labor Party, then led, as it is now, by the member for Brand, to support strong border protection policies, this government had the courage to do so. - These policies have nothing to do with listening to Indonesian politicians. While I am on my feet, can I say something to Indonesian politicians, both those here and those who may be listening or reading in Indonesia: I want them to understand from me, on behalf of the government, how extremely disappointed, even distressed, millions of Australians will be at the release of Abu Bakar Bashir. Many Australians will see that particular outcome, although a product of the Indonesian justice system, as an extremely disappointing result.Let me remind the member for Watson that it was this government, the Liberal-National Party government, that stopped the flow of unauthorised arrivals. It was the Australian Labor Party that would have kept our borders open. It was the Australian Labor Party that opposed the Pacific solution. It was the Australian Labor Party that opposed all the strong measures that were needed, and this bill is of a piece with those strong measures.</DOC>

 - Not only am I aware of the damage that would be done by taking away Australian workplace agreements but so is the Australian Mines and Metals Association, an association that represents a section of the Australian economy which, according to the member for Perth - who is the spokesman for the Labor Party on these matters - is responsible for the boom economic conditions we are experiencing particularly in Western Australia. According to this association, which represents the mining industry, removing workplace agreements would cost $6.6 billion a year. That is the cost to the mining industry. This is not my figure; it is not the figure of the ABS; it is the figure of the Australian Mines and Metals Association. - In 2004, Access Economics, the preferred economic modeller of the Australian Labor Party, had this to say after it released a major study into the Labor Party's industrial relations policy:The likely outcome  is lower productivity growth and less accurate matching of wages and productivity at the enterprise level.Yesterday, the Chief Operating Officer of Austral in Western Australia, one of the most outstanding examples of Australian incentive and ingenuity - located, I believe, in the electorate of Brand, represented by the Leader of the Opposition -  - said that the survival of the $529 million company depended on the AWA system. Let me say that again: the survival of one of Australia's most successful export companies -  - depends upon the survival of the AWA system. He said:This industry would not be here in Western Australia under a collective agreement. - He said:This industry would not be here in Western Australia under a collective agreement. Our product would be nowhere near as high. We would not be able to survive.This is field evidence. This is evidence from people who know the industry. They know the value of workplace agreements. They know the poison that returning to collective agreements would represent for their industry. I say again that the plan of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to workplace agreements is a direct attack on aspirational Australia. It is a direct attack on the success stories of Australian industry. It is a direct attack on our export industries. As the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition ought to be ashamed that it is a direct attack on the prosperity of the great state of Western Australia.</DOC>

 - I am not aware, nor could I be expected to be aware -  - of individual cases such as that. Thousands of people leave employment and gain employment all over Australia every week. But I am aware, and the Leader of the Opposition should be aware, of an article in the Australian Financial Review this morning written by an academic by the name of Don Harding that makes the point that, on a preliminary examination of the early figures on the behaviour of the workforce since the introduction of the new industrial relations legislation, there is absolutely no evidence of the mass sackings of which the Labor Party is so ready to speak. Indeed, the preliminary indications are that the employment outlook has actually got better since the Work Choices legislation was introduced. I know that will be intensely disappointing to the Leader of the Opposition, because he has been hoping and praying for a deterioration in the figures. He always wants bad economic news in the hope that he can use it in propaganda against this government.I do not know the circumstances of that individual. In the question of a similar kind that he asked me yesterday, he did not disclose to the House the fact that the lady to whom he referred was entitled to bring a claim for unlawful dismissal. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to get up in this House and deny any knowledge that she was bringing a claim for unlawful dismissal, because the source of the information that came to me was a union. I find it hard to believe that, if I can find out from the union, the Leader of the Opposition, who does everything they want, could not also find out from the union.</DOC>

 - Let me say in reply to that question that the abolition of Australian workplace agreements would not only damage companies but also damage hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to do away with them is a direct frontal attack on aspirational Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released statistics which show that non-managerial employees are five per cent better off on AWAs than on collective agreements.I have been asked what do I say to a particular case. Let me say, rhetorically: what do critics of the government's policy, including of the opposition, say to Mr Eddie Belcher, a worker referred to in the West Australian this morning? He had a firm message to the Leader of the Opposition about the roll back of his AWA. He said:Just try and take them away.The Australian newspaper reported a Queensland coalminer, Graeme Ware, as seeing:... no reason to return to union influence in setting awards.The article reported that Mr Ware, a worker at the Sedgman coal washing plant at Nebo, west of Mackay, works four days on and three days off and earns more than $100,000 a year. They are the sorts of people that the Labor Party wants to do down. They are the sorts of people that the Labor Party wants to take a stick to. They are the sorts of people that are responsible for this extraordinary growth in our resource sector. The Labor Party is happy all the time to say, 'The only reason the country is doing well is that we have a resources boom.' That is an incomplete, invalid proposition. It is a bit odd if you say: 'The reason we are prosperous is that we have a resources boom. So what we, the Labor Party will do, is destroy the living conditions of those who are contributing to the resources boom.' It is a very odd kind of argument. - I remind the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, that since 1996, nearly a million Australians have signed AWAs - The member for Brisbane then left the chamber. - Since Work Choices began, nearly 30,000 AWAs have been lodged. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip all of them up and he wants to rip up all of the older AWAs. I will leave the last word in answer to my colleague's question to that Western Australian worker, Mr Eddie Belcher. He said:Australians have got freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of everything. If we want to make a deal with our employer over our working conditions, that is up to us.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the individual circumstances of this case - nor, of course, can I be expected to be aware - but I have never disguised the fact that one of the changes we made was to remove the unfair dismissal laws in relation to companies employing fewer than 100 people. We make no apology for having done that. - We make no apology for having done that because we believe, as indeed many people around the country have believed for a long time, that the old unfair dismissal laws, introduced by the Labor Party under a secret deal with the ACTU during the 1993 election campaign, have in fact destroyed jobs. What you must do in relation to something such as this is assess the overall impact on the total workforce, and there is no doubt at all that there will be employment gains, especially in small business, as a result of the changes that have been made. - Every country that maintains the rigid, regulated IR system that Labor is now unequivocally committed to has higher levels of unemployment than do the countries that embrace the sort of policy that we believe in. It is no secret that Australia, Great Britain, the United States and New Zealand, with less regulated labour markets, have lower levels of unemployment than countries such as Germany, France and other nations of Europe.If you want to reregulate the Australian labour market, go ahead and do so, and realise that as a result you will drive tens of thousands of extra Australians onto the dole queues. I remind those opposite who fulminate with moral outrage that in the early 1990s you had all the regulation in the world, yet you drove a million Australians onto the dole queues, you saw their living standards drag and you saw their aspirations belted to smithereens by the economic downturn that your industrial relations policy did nothing to stop. We have changed these laws because we believe - and we have sound evidence to support it through the experience of other countries - that a freer labour market and greater flexibility in relation to hiring and so forth of people will result in higher levels of employment. That is the evidence and that is the reason why we have taken our decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I can inform him that the OECD released its employment outlook overnight, expecting Australian economic growth to accelerate in 2006-07 and forecasting employment growth of two per cent in 2006 and 1.2 per cent in 2007. Although that is slower, that would outpace labour force growth, leading the OECD to project a fall in the unemployment rate to 4.7 per cent in 2006-07. That is a fall from an unemployment rate which is now at a 30-year low, with the government having presided over the creation of 1.7 million new jobs since its election.The OECD jobs strategy has four components: set appropriate macro-economic policy, remove impediments to labour market participation, tackle labour and product market obstacles to demand and facilitate the development of labour force skills and competencies. In identifying barriers to labour market demand, one of the things that the OECD focuses on is what it calls employment protection legislation, known in this country as unfair dismissal legislation. The OECD says this:The link between the stance of employment protection legislation and aggregate unemployment is uncertain in theory, and in practice is highly dependent on the specific national context. However, there is evidence that too-strict legislation will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation. This may worsen job prospects of certain groups, like young people, women and the long-term unemployed.In other words, the OECD is saying not just in respect of Australia but in respect of all of the developed economies of the world that, if you have employment protection legislation that is too strict, it worsens the opportunity for employment of those that are the most marginalised in the community - the young people, the women and the long-term unemployed. This is an observation which the OECD has made across all the developed economies of the world, whether it be the United States, Japan or Europe.There is one factor that increasingly becomes obvious as you do comparative labour market studies: those countries which have the strictest employment legislation have the highest unemployment rates. That is why unemployment is high in Germany; that is why unemployment is high in France. If you want to structurally reduce barriers to unemployment, flexibility in employment protection legislation is required. The Australian Labor Party, which has set its face against the modernisation of Australia's industrial relations law, is doing injustice to the people who would be most marginalised in the labour market. - So you do not have to take it from this government - you can take it from the OECD, you can take it from the IMF, you can take it from international experience that those things that are required to make an economy flexible in a modern, international, globalised economic environment are those things that will create the most jobs. And it is the people who are prepared to take the hard decisions, not the populist decisions, who will create the job opportunities for the most marginalised in our society: the long-term unemployed, the young and women. There is one side of Australian politics that stands for job creation, and it is the Liberal and the National parties. There is one side of Australian politics that stands for high unemployment, and it is the Australian Labor Party. Kids, women and the long-term unemployed have a chance of a job under a Liberal and National Party government because the Liberal and National parties are prepared to do the necessary reform to ensure that it can happen.</DOC>

 - I will answer the Leader of the Opposition when he asks me what hope have I got of convincing middle Australia. Let me use a phrase that one or two of you have heard before: my guarantee is my record. -  - The Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues can interrupt, can point to the gallery and can quote from pamphlets and the views of individuals, but nothing can gainsay the facts. The fact is that the unemployed are better off under this government than they have been for 30 years. The fact is that last week we had an unemployment rate that was at a record 30-year low. The fact is that real wages have risen under this government by 16.8 per cent. The real fact is that over the last 10 years we have created 1.8 million new jobs in this economy. The Leader of the Opposition started his question to me by saying he did not want anything to do with France and Germany. If he does not want anything to do with France or Germany he should not embrace the policies that have delivered a 30 per cent youth unemployment rate in France and that have also left the German economy with an unemployment rate of around 10 or 11 per cent. The undeniable fact is that those economies that deregulate their labour markets generate greater productivity and reduce unemployment. Those economies and those countries that continue to regulate, to suffocate and to stultify their labour markets produce higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of economic growth.That is why a courageously successful Labour leader, like Tony Blair, when he became Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1997, had the courage to face the trade union movement of that country and say that their old ways had to change, that they had to accept the labour market reforms of the Thatcher era and they had to accept that the days of sandwiches and beer at No. 10 to solve industrial disputes were forever behind them. What a contrast: the courage of Tony Blair addressing the TUC in May 1997, acquainting them with the realities of the modern world, and the Leader of the Opposition meekly rolling over in the Sydney Town Hall last Sunday. The contrast could not have been starker with a leader prepared if necessary to disagree with those in his own ranks in the national interest. Successful Labor leaders - indeed, successful leaders on occasions - have to disagree with those in their own ranks if they know that in so doing they are matching the national interest.The man who sits opposite me, and would be the Prime Minister of this country, has failed the national interest. He has allowed himself to be bullied by the union bosses of Australia and he has disqualified himself not only in the eyes of people who traditionally vote Liberal but, I reckon, in the eyes of many of these miners in Western Australia, who probably come from lifelong Labor Party backgrounds. Person after person in the mining industry of this country, brought up in the labour movement, is turning their back on the labour movement because the labour movement no longer represents the hopes and the dreams of aspirational Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and his interest in workplace reform in Australia. The record shows that workplace reform over the last decade, and the flexibility that that has brought to the labour market, has indeed strengthened the Australian economy to the benefit of all Australians. The record quite clearly speaks for itself: the 30-year-low unemployment rate in Australia of 4.9 per cent, the 1.8 million extra jobs that have been created in the last decade and the 16.8 per cent increase in real wages. Ongoing reform is part of the move to strengthen the economy significantly and importantly to create more jobs for Australians so that more and more of our fellow men and women can share in the national prosperity.The member for Fadden asked me whether there were any proposals for change. Indeed, there are. We have the Leader of the Opposition adopting a Mark Latham economic stance on policy, wanting to take us back to the pre-Keating reform era. Why is this? Simply because the unions are demanding that they do so. The unions are right about one thing. They have realised what other Australians have realised and that is that the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to public policy is weak. He does not have the spine to stand up to them. He buckles under, as he did at the weekend at the New South Wales Labor conference, no matter how extreme the proposals and the demands from the unions are.Having buckled under once, what are the other demands that we are now getting from the union movement insofar as the workplace is concerned? First of all, they have demanded that AWAs go. He buckled under to that and in the process hung out to dry some hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. On top of that, we now have Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, demanding compulsory collective bargaining in Australia. That would mean that you would have the union involved in every negotiation at the workplace - something the Prime Minister quoted the workers in Western Australia as being opposed to. We have on top of that Bill Shorten, the next great hope of the Australian Labor Party, demanding that non-union workers be slugged with compulsory union bargaining agents fees. That is code for compulsory unionism in Australia.But that is not the end of it. Let us look at the other demands. These are the sorts of demands that Mark Latham caved into, and we can see the new Leader of the Opposition caving into them as well. They want to squeeze the casual and part-time labour market in Australia dry. They want to whack small and medium sized businesses by reimposing the unfair dismissal regime. They want to give unions automatic right of entry into more workplaces and they want to allow secondary union boycotts and industry-wide strikes. The list goes on and on. This weakness from the Leader of the Opposition has led in the last couple of days to increasing demands from the unions as to what the Labor Party should do in their policy.What was found with respect to this policy when the previous Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, was there? Access Economics had a look at the Labor Party's policy with all these changes in it. This is what they concluded. It would diminish the capacity of business to create jobs for older people, for young Australians and for women; it would have a significant impact on manufacturing, on retail, on farming and on the mining industry in Australia; it would lessen productivity; and it would put pressure on unemployment. Here we have a repeat from the Leader of the Opposition. He is now adopting the economically irresponsible policies of the previous Leader of the Opposition which would take the Australian economy backwards by allowing the unions to dictate an extreme workplace relations policy. This would involve the unions in Australia having a seat at the cabinet table, should the Leader of the Opposition ever be elected to the prime ministership of this country. It would take Australia backwards, it would destroy employment, it would push unemployment up and it would diminish the prosperity of this nation.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Perth, if the remarks attributed to that person are accurate, let me say through him to that person that I think he is wrong, just as the member for Perth was wrong 10 years ago when he said the world would come to an end with our industrial relations reform and just as the then member for Canberra spoke on behalf of the Labor Party when that legislation came back in its amended form from the Senate in November 1996 and he posed three questions. Will unemployment fall? Answer: yes. Will the nation be more productive? Yes. Will industrial disputes go up or go down? In fact, they have gone down. Indeed, the latest figures show that for the March quarter of 2006 we have recorded fewer industrial disputes than in any quarter since we began to collect these statistics. That is a pretty interesting figure. If there is one thing about the Labor Party that I remember from the dim, distant past when they occasionally talked sense on these issues, it is that they said, 'If you want to reduce industrial disputes, elect a Labor government.' The truth is that unemployment has gone down, wages have gone up, prosperity and productivity have increased and industrial disputes have fallen. - All of that has happened over the last 10 years, despite the dire warnings of many in the community, particularly the Labor Party. Just as the dire warnings were wrong then, they are wrong now. I would predict that in 10 years time, when questions come up in this House, the spokesman who will be answering on behalf of the government of the day will be able to point to the productive benefits of the industrial relations policies of this government. - I am glad that the member for Batman is enjoying what I am saying because it is true, Martin, and you should enjoy it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and acknowledge the work that he does on the finance and treasury committee. On 9 May in this year's budget, the government announced the biggest reform to superannuation in decades. Members will know that the government's reform plan involves making superannuation payments out of taxed funds tax free when a person turns 60 - tax free for lump sums, tax free for pensions. No longer will it be necessary to differentiate between pre-1983 and post-1983 and pre-1994 and post-1994 capital gains tax, exempt or otherwise. There will be one simple rule: when those who have their superannuation in a taxed fund turn 60, they will be able to take benefits tax free. In addition to that, the government plan involves halving the age pension's assets test taper, extending the co-contribution to the self-employed and encouraging people to remain in the workforce by giving them the option to take superannuation tax free whilst they remain perhaps in part-time employment or otherwise after the age of 60.We are still to hear from the Labor Party what its position on this legislation is. It has not announced a position, notwithstanding that this was announced in the May budget. Susan Ryan, writing in the Australian on 12 May 2006, had this to say:'These are the most important changes to superannuation ever,' Peter Costello boasts. They're even more important, he claims, than the 1992 introduction by the Keating government of compulsory super. The Treasurer can often overstate his case, but this time he's right.I do not agree with everything she wrote. - She goes on to say:That's a pretty big mouthful, coming from a lifelong ALP supporter and former Labor minister. My political history to the contrary, I believe Costello has a lot to boast about.There we go - we're getting a bit of leadership from a former Labor minister. Back in the old days, when the Labor Party used to have policy, they would actually announce where they stood on these things. Instead of engaging, as Mark Latham called it, in 'scab-lifting politics' - running around trying to find a little place where they can lift a scab and try to cause trouble - once upon a time Labor had leadership and Labor had policy. But that was long before the member for Brand. At the rate he is going, he will be here a long time with his policy backflips. When he has backflips, they shake the earth. It was no little ripple in the Sydney Town Hall - the earth moved for the whole of Australia.I digress. Yesterday the government announced that the $150,000 entitlement for post-tax contributions could be averaged over three years. In addition to that, one year would count from budget night to 30 June. That would mean that a person has an entitlement to put in $150,000 of post-tax contributions between the period starting on 10 May and 30 June. In addition to that, three-year averaging means that you can put in, in any one year, $450,000 of post-tax contributions as long as you do not put in anything else in the two years thereafter - that is, the $450,000 would take up the entitlement of three years. In order to protect against the backdating for years that have not been taken up, it will be on a 'use it or lose it' basis. So anybody can put in $450,000 as long as they do not put in anything for the two years thereafter.  - In addition to that, small business owners can contribute up to $500,000 of capital gains from the sale of a business to superannuation in addition to contributions allowed under the cap. These transitional announcements have been welcomed by industry. - They have been described as sensible transitional arrangements by IFSA and by others in the industry. We look forward to the ALP coming up with a policy in relation to superannuation. We look forward to the ALP announcing its position. These are long-term structural reforms for the Australian economy and we would appreciate a bit of support from the other side of the parliament for this important reform for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and her strong support for small businesses on the Gold Coast. I can advise the House that Australia's 1.2 million small businesses, and the 3.3 million Australians that they employ, have thrived and prospered under the strong economic management of this government. Building on that, because of the workplace relations reform, Australia's small businesses now have greater certainty and greater flexibility. This is borne out in the latest Sensis business index, which was released in May. It showed very strong support by Australia's small businesses for government policies. In fact, it is the second highest level of support ever recorded in the history of the survey. Let me tell the House what the survey found. It said:Once again, the Federal Government's industrial relations policies were by far the main reason that SMEs gave for believing that the Federal Government was trying to support small business.I am also asked about how small business has reacted to suggestions that there may be policy changes. I can tell the House that small business has reacted very angrily to the Leader of the Opposition stating that he will bring back unfair dismissal and he will abolish AWAs. In fact, this House should realise what small business people are saying at the grassroots level. Small business people like Con and Marie de Groot, newsagents, use AWAs and have told me there would be people who would not be able to be employed -  -  - I will just repeat that in case members missed it. These are small business people at the grassroots, and they have said that there would be people who would not be able to be employed if we did not have AWAs. It is little wonder that small business has reacted angrily to the Leader of the Opposition's proposal. It knows that the Leader of the Opposition does not stand for small business. He in fact has said:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.Small business certainly knows that.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. The report from ANSTO - through its spokesman, Mr Pearce - was that there was absolutely no radiation threat to the health of ANSTO workers or the community. - Mr Pearce went on to say that there was no measurable contamination found outside the immediate area where the incident occurred and there were no off-site consequences. So, according to ANSTO, there was absolutely no radiation threat to the health of the workers of ANSTO or the community. This is just a beat-up by Labor to deflect from the fact that we are having an open debate on nuclear power. - The Labor Party is clearly trying to deflect from the fact that we are having a debate on nuclear power. As I said earlier, ANSTO have stated that there was absolutely no radiation threat and no measurable contamination outside the immediate area where the incident occurred or in the community generally. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest and I appreciate his interest in raising this important issue. Abu Bakar Bashir was released from prison this morning. He had served a 25-month sentence for his role in the conspiracy to commit the 2002 Bali bombing. The Australian government made it clear at the time the sentence was handed down that we believed that the sentence was far too short. We were profoundly disappointed that the sentence was so short and, as a result, we are deeply disappointed with the release of Abu Bakar Bashir today.The government know that this will cause a great deal of pain and concern to the families of the victims of the Bali bombing, and we share the concern of those people. Although it is true that the people who were specifically responsible for planting the Bali bombs have been caught - three of them having been sentenced to death and others having been sentenced to life imprisonment - the Indonesian court did find that Abu Bakar Bashir was involved in the conspiracy to commit this heinous crime. It is also important to note that Abu Bakar Bashir is said to be the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, which is the organisation that was not just behind that Bali bombing but also behind a number of acts of terror in Indonesia. So we appreciated the conviction. We were very disappointed with the length of the sentence, and we are deeply disappointed that at the end of that sentence - not surprising, I suppose - Abu Bakar Bashir has been released.In April this year, Abu Bakar Bashir was listed by the United Nations Security Council's 1267 Committee as a terrorist who is subject to international restrictions. Indonesia, as a member of the United Nations, is obliged to enforce those restrictions and those restrictions will severely limit any capacity Abu Bakar Bashir might have to commit harm. His financial assets will be frozen. Any funding for Bashir will be prohibited. He is not allowed to travel internationally and he is not allowed to have access to weapons or to any military equipment.Indonesia does have a very strong record in fighting terrorism. It has captured and convicted over 160 terrorists. Three are on death row and four are serving life sentences. The mastermind behind the bomb-making of Jemaah Islamiah, Azahari, was killed in a raid last November. I think the Indonesians are doing a good job in closing in on Noordin Top, who is another one of the Jemaah Islamiah key leaders.Having said all that, the Australian government cannot walk away from the fact that we are deeply disappointed that Abu Bakar Bashir has been released from prison. We of course accept the decisions of the Indonesian courts, but we are deeply disappointed with that release today and we share the pain with those families that suffered so much as a result of the Bali bombing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and I can assure her that this government remains unambiguously and unequivocally tough on drugs. Since 1997, this government has committed more than $1 billion to interdict the supply of illicit drugs into this country, to rehabilitate drug addicts and to educate the Australian people about the dangers of illicit drugs.I am pleased to say that this campaign is working. The percentage of Australians using illicit drugs has dropped from 22 per cent in 1998 to 15 per cent in 2004. That constitutes a reduction of 1.5 million people - that is 1.5 million fewer people using illicit drugs, thanks substantially to this government's policies. In the recent budget, the government committed a further $48 million towards our tough-on-drugs strategies, including a new cannabis prevention and control centre to study the links between marijuana use and mental illness, and also $24 million to a campaign to make young people more aware of the dangers that drugs pose to them.So there is a very clear message from this government: there is no safe way to use illicit drugs. But, unfortunately, that is not the message from the opposition. Every recent opposition leader has supported heroin injecting rooms. The current Leader of the Opposition has said:It is wrong for the Prime Minister to stand in the way of the NSW Government's proposed safe injecting room ...This is typical of the Leader of the Opposition. He surrendered to the Islamists over Iraq, he surrenders to the unions over workplace relations and he surrenders to the premiers over heroin injecting rooms. - No, I haven't. - Mr Speaker, I am simply quoting back to the Leader of the Opposition what he said:It is wrong for the Prime Minister to stand in the way of the NSW Government's proposed safe injecting room ...This is someone who supports safe injecting rooms. This is someone who does not back the practical policies of this government to cut down on illicit drug use. I am not surprised that the member for Lalor should suddenly wax indignant on this, because she is just as soft on drugs. She gave a statement -  -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw. But let me simply quote what her spokesman said to the Courier-Mail on 29 January 2004:A spokesman for shadow health minister Julia Gillard said states would be able to make up their own minds about injecting rooms.'If state governments make that decision ... then we'd back them,' she said.They support injecting rooms. So I simply make this point: you can trust the Howard government to be tough on drugs. You can trust members opposite to say they are tough on drugs but not to support the practical policies to stop drugs getting into the hands of Australian kids.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am often asked about immigration issues because of my previous role. One of the points I make when I speak to people is that good immigration policy is the fundamental role for a minister for immigration. That is implemented through policies that give effect to our need for people with appropriate skills and our need to respond to genuine and close family reunion, coupled with a generous response to the most vulnerable refugees.That is a policy that the Australian government has implemented over a long time and continues to implement. You can only implement a policy of that type if you are able to effectively manage your borders. You cannot implement good immigration policy without effective border management. The measures that we have announced are consistent with our international obligations and will be administered consistently with those obligations. They will send a very firm message to those people who seek to come to Australia that there is a proper way of doing so, and that is the one they ought to take.</DOC>

 - The legislation which will shortly be before the parliament does not involve the excision of the Australian mainland. That is the ludicrous proposition that has been put by the Leader of the Opposition. This legislation establishes a total consistency in the treatment of unlawful arrivals in Australia between people who might come onto the mainland and people who might come onto offshore islands. This legislation further entrenches a highly successful border protection policy, to which the government remains fully committed. It does not involve what the Leader of the Opposition has said. It is he who is being ludicrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. Can I say again to the House what I said yesterday: the government, and I am sure the great majority of the people of Australia, greeted the news of the release of Abu Bakar Bashir not only with disappointment but also with a reaction verging on hostility and disgust. His release and the inflammatory statements that he has made in support of extremism since he has been released have been deeply offensive, especially to the families of the men and women of this country who died in the Bali attack in October of 2002.The honourable member for Hasluck asks me what action the government has taken to communicate its views to the Indonesian government. I can inform the House that this morning I wrote to the Indonesian President, using the words that I have just used to describe the reaction of the Australian people to Abu Bakar Bashir's release. I went on to say that, whilst fully respecting and recognising the adherence to due process in the Indonesian court system, the Indonesian government should understand the deep anger in the Australian community and our sense of concern about what has happened.I also said in that letter to the Indonesian President that it was important that the Indonesian government monitor very closely the activities of Mr Bashir and implement fully the obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1264. As the House would be aware, I said to the President that Mr Bashir's name had been added to a list of terrorists subject to a range of international restrictions under this resolution, including an assets freeze, restrictions on international travel and access to arms. We would hope that the Indonesian government would fully adhere to and support the implementation of its obligations under that part of the UN Security Council's resolution.The Australian government remains strongly committed to working closely with the Indonesian government in fighting terrorism, and I place on record again the deep appreciation of the Australian people for the excellent work done by the Indonesian police in the wake of the Bali attack. The reality is of course that, of those directly involved in that attack, so many of them are being brought to justice. A number are awaiting the imposition of the death penalty and others have been sentenced to very long terms of imprisonment. So in relation to the people who actually carried out the attack, Indonesian justice has been effective, it has been diligent and it has been comprehensive. But that does not in any way relieve the sense of anger and concern in our community about Bashir's release, and I have conveyed those concerns to the President. I might add that our charge d'affaires in Jakarta has personally spoken this morning to the Indonesian foreign minister, Dr Wirajuda, to reinforce the concern felt by the Australian community. For the information of the House, I table a copy of my letter to the President of Indonesia.</DOC>

But I am in possession of the broad economic outcomes that have been achieved under this government and I am in possession of all the warnings of doom and destruction, unemployment and industrial disputation that were made 10 years ago when we made some changes. I am absolutely certain that, just as those predictions were incorrectly made and were not borne out by subsequent experience, so it will be that the experiences of the Australian workforce under the government's new policies will be ones of increasing employment, rising real wages and continued growth of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. I am aware of reports that the World Food Program, which is an agency of the United Nations, has given an organisation called Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia, known as MMI - Abu Bakar Bashir was the co-founder and at one time the chairman of this organisation - 95 tonnes of food to donate to victims of the 27 May earthquake in Central Java. It has been brought to my attention that a spokesman for MMI has said that Abu Bakar Bashir intends to distribute this food, which was provided for and by the United Nations, to the victims himself.Let me make this absolutely clear. We regard this decision by the World Food Program, by the United Nations, to use MMI as one of the organisations that would distribute food as completely unacceptable. Our Jakarta post has contacted the World Food Program in Indonesia and made that view perfectly clear. Our ambassador in Rome will also be speaking to the World Food Program, whose headquarters are in Rome, during the course of today, when he is able to do so, making the same point: that we regard the use of an organisation like MMI, which was co-founded by Abu Bakar Bashir and of which Abu Bakar Bashir was the chairman, as completely unacceptable. Obviously, this organisation plans to use the distribution of this food, funded by the international community, as a propaganda tool and therefore the United Nations should not allow itself, in any circumstances or through any of its agencies, to be unintentionally, of course, manipulated in that way.Let me say, just in case honourable members are wondering, that actually no Australian government funds have been given to the World Food Program for the earthquake victims in Yogyakarta. Our aid has gone in different ways. But having said that, Australia is a major contributor - I think off the top of my head it is the third or fourth largest contributor to the World Food Program - so we are particularly sensitive to this type of action.In relation to the second part of the question, the Prime Minister has already indicated that we have made high-level representations to the Indonesians - we have been for quite some time - in relation to the release of Abu Bakar Bashir. Those representations have included a discussion between our acting ambassador, the Charge d'Affaires in Jakarta, and Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda. We of course are making the point to the Indonesians that we hope that they will be able to monitor on a continuous basis the activities of Abu Bakar Bashir, but we have reinforced to the Indonesians that under Security Council resolution 1267 Indonesia is required to ensure that Abu Bakar Bashir, who is listed by the UN as a terrorist, will not be able to harm people. The restrictions imposed by the UN on Abu Bakar Bashir include the freezing of his assets. No funding can be provided to Abu Bakar Bashir. He is not allowed to travel internationally and he is not allowed access to weapons or to military equipment. The Australian government and the Indonesian government will continue to consult with each other on this issue. I am not going to go into the responses they have given us, excepting to say that we have constructive discussions with them and I think that constructive relationship on this issue will continue.</DOC>

 - We are changing our laws to make them stronger in Australia's national interest. I am very interested indeed that the Chief Opposition Whip should have asked this question. It took my mind back to the latter months of 2001, when the current Leader of the Opposition was also then Leader of the Opposition and he was highly critical of the anti-people-smuggling policies of my government. One of the strongest arguments he advanced was, in a nutshell, that in order to solve this problem you had to have total cooperation with Indonesia. The strongest possible argument was that we should make sure that we cooperated with Indonesia. This is what the Leader of the Opposition then said:Effective measures to combat people-smuggling require cooperation with neighbouring countries that are serving as transit routes for illegal people movement to Australia. People-smuggling poses a significant national security problem not only for Australia but also for our neighbours, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.This is what he went on to say:A Labor government will pursue the issue of people-smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian government. We will do so in the context of a wholehearted commitment to build a mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia.In essence, what the Leader of the Opposition was saying then was in fact true - that is, in order to stop people-smuggling you need the cooperation of Indonesia. Everything that we have done has been designed to maintain that cooperation. But to suggest that that is an exercise in anything other than the sovereignty of this country is, to borrow a phrase used by the Leader of the Opposition earlier, plainly ludicrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. It goes to the heart of what is very important to the lives of millions of Australians - that is, the strength of the Australian economy. He asks what we have done to promote growth and strengthen the economy. I remind him of the remarkable record in fiscal management, of which the Managing Director of the IMF spoke so approvingly when he was in Canberra yesterday -  - Glowingly, the Treasurer quite properly adds. Glowingly, he spoke of the way in which we have reduced our debt, the way in which, through labour market and other reforms, we have created a first-class economy for a first-class nation in the 21st century.The member for La Trobe asks me whether I am aware of any threats to this. There are many threats. There are some over which the Australian people have no control - threats such as international factors, like the high price of crude oil, which is leading to very painfully high petrol prices in Australia. That is amongst the things that we do not control. But we do control our domestic policy, and this government has made it clear that part of the reform process is to make sure that we maintain further changes to our labour markets. - Those policies are under direct attack from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has committed himself, if he becomes Prime Minister, to the abolition of Australian workplace agreements, which will cut the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australians. In the process of attacking our policies the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues are engaging in many tactics that are designed to misrepresent and to mislead. Mr Speaker, let me take you back to the last sitting week, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a completely false accusation about Teys Bros meatworks in Naracoorte in South Australia. I remind the House -  - I notice the member for Jagajaga interjects. If she is a little patient, I will come to what she said. I remind the House that the member alleged that overseas workers were being given preferential treatment compared with Australian workers. That claim was totally and completely false. Since it was refuted in this House, I have received a letter from Gary Teys, the Deputy Chairman of Teys Bros. I will table the letter in a moment. Amongst other things, this is what he had to say. It bears very directly on this dishonest campaign that is being waged by the opposition alleging that people entering this country on temporary 457 visas are taking the jobs of Australians. This is what he had to say:It seems strange to me that we have become the target of the opposition and the media in this matter of overseas workers on temporary 457 Visas.He goes on to say:Had it not been for the overseas workers in our plants we would never have been able to fully utilise these facilities. Despite extensive efforts to recruit Australian Workers through advertising and enlist the assistance of the AMIEU - an Australian union - to provide us with names of workers, we were unsuccessful in obtaining the numbers of staff required at our various plants.This is completely contradictory to what was represented in this House by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is of a piece with the way in which question time day after day is used by the opposition to make completely false claims about the impact of this on the country. He goes on to say - and this really puts it in perspective:We saw the overseas workers as our only opportunity to keep the plants operating at an efficient level and we are certain that if the labour shortage had not been filled by these overseas workers, then some of our plants would have been forced to close, thus costing the jobs of Australian Workers.In other words, not only were these foreign workers brought in because there were no Australian workers to fill the new jobs but, if they had not been brought in, existing Australian workers in jobs would have lost their jobs. In other words, there would have been a double whammy effect. That is the sort of policy and attitude that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her leader are flogging around this country. It does a great injustice to the foreign workers, it does a great injustice to Australian companies and it is contrary to all the experience of a nation that is now experiencing levels of unemployment that the Leader of the Opposition when he was last in government could only have dreamt of. I table the letter.</DOC>

 - Let me say in reply to the member for Perth, firstly, that it is a fact that often questions asked by the opposition are not true. That is a fact. It is a fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a totally false set of assertions when she asked a question of me about Teys Bros. It is a fact that I am not, for the reasons that any reasonable person would understand, in possession of the employment details of every employment arrangement made in this country. But it is a fact that since this government have been in office we have created 1.8 million more jobs. It is a fact that real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. It is a fact that that compares with wage rises of about one to two per cent in the 13 years of the previous Labor government. It is a fact that when we reformed the industrial relations laws 10 years ago we were told that they would drive down productivity, they would push up industrial disputes, they would push up unemployment and they would depress productivity. All of those claims were wrong. It is a fact that economic predictions made by the opposition are almost always totally false.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The honourable member for Cowper would recognise that one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. He would recognise that, as a result of many of the government's policies, unemployment is now at its lowest level in 30 years - at a 4.9 per cent average across Australia. In his area of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, unemployment has fallen considerably. He would also recognise that there has been significant growth in real wages over the life of our government. It has all been a result of good economic management and a reform process that has helped us maintain our competitive and efficient edge both domestically and internationally in the international marketplace. It is important that we recognise the importance of workplace reforms in helping make sure that Australia's exporting industries maintain their competitive edge across the world.There are a number of examples that have come forward in recent days of domestic Australian businesses, regional businesses as well as export businesses, maintaining that competitive edge because of the reforms that our government has put in place. I will give the member for Cowper some examples. There is a company in Central Queensland called Mobbs and Co., which is a steel manufacturer and supplier to mining and rural industries, both export industries, as well as the building industry, including those key exporters. They have been using AWAs with all of their 30 staff since 1997. The managing director, Kym Mobbs, said:If we hadn't had AWAs, we would not have been able to compete. Our advantage is that we have the flexibility to adapt to changing customer needs because our staff feel part of our business.They are part of the business because of the AWAs.Last night there was a most enjoyable function held in Canberra, and I know that a number of the members of the opposition were there as well. It was the farewell for Peter Corish, the former President of the National Farmers Federation. He spoke about AWAs in his own personal business. With regard to his business, he said:We have found them very effective in providing agreements that gives certainty for the employees as well as for us as employers.He said 'certainty for employees as well as for the employers'. - I will leave the last quote to a small business person from Dubbo. Tina Reynolds, who runs a business called A1 Tree Service, was quoted in the Daily Liberal, the newspaper in Dubbo, talking about AWAs. It is an interesting name for a newspaper. It is in the electorate of the member for Parkes - it is in one of our electorates. Tina Reynolds said about AWAs in her business:They've worked well for us. It's a wonderful way of communicating between employers and employees. Our employees have sick days, public holidays and all of that. - Ms Reynolds said:If they're a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer is going to look after you.That is the last word from a small business person. Of course, that is exactly the case: good employers are going to look after good employees. The skills shortage is there, but we have to keep the economy going. We have to keep good skilled staff engaged in the workplace. That is the evidence coming from across regional Australia. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition should listen to the last line of that quote: if you are a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer will look after you. So if he is a good employee, because of the skills shortage on the frontbench, his employer, the unions of Australia, will look after him.</DOC>

 - I say to the Leader of the Opposition: what matters in relation to economic performance is what you deliver.The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - The Leader of the Opposition can gesticulate, the Leader of the Opposition can yell and scream during question time, but that yelling and screaming does not reach the ears of the 1.8 million Australians now in work compared with those who were in work when he last sat on the treasury side of the Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition's rhetoric cannot alter the fact that -  - all the predictions he made 10 years ago were of a piece with the predictions he is making now. He said then that wages would be driven down. He said then that unemployment would go up. He said then that productivity would go down. He said then that industrial disputes would rise. And every single prediction that the Leader of the Opposition -  - Every single prediction he made 10 years ago was proved wrong. I know he is unhappy about the fact that we now have unemployment of 4.9 per cent. I know he is unhappy about the fact that we have one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. I know he is unhappy about the fact that we have 1.9 million more people in work. He is unhappy about the fact that the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund -  -  - I simply conclude by making the obvious generic point that, 10 years ago, we were told that the world was going to come to an end. We were told that the sky was going to fall in. We know the Leader of the Opposition is broken-hearted that the economy is doing so well, but he should not try to take out his political frustration by asking absurd questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. In this year's budget the government announced the most significant superannuation changes in the last two decades, and they were very widely welcomed. The Investment and Financial Services Association said:The effective removal of end benefits tax and tax on super pensions is a major step toward the simplification of an overly complex ... regime.ASFA said:The 2006 Budget plan could sweep away some of the frustrating complexity of Australia's superannuation system ...AMP said:These initiatives help ensure Australia maintains one of the most progressive and well-managed retirement income systems in the world.The Institute of Actuaries said:The Institute strongly applauds the government's big bang approach to the government reforms.So we have near universal endorsement of the government's plan for the greatest reform to superannuation in the last two decades. Who would oppose it and on what grounds? I was very concerned to read in the Age newspaper today in an article titled 'ALP digs in over no-tax super plan':Labor is reserving its right to oppose the Howard Government's headline-grabbing promise to make superannuation payouts tax-free for workers ...Yesterday I raised the issue that Labor had been ominously silent - that Labor had not come out and supported this change - and now we see Senator Sherry slipping around to the Age newspaper to tell us Labor's real plan. Labor's real plan is to dig in over the abolition of taxes on superannuation. - Seeing that we are interested in employee entitlements, let me tell people what Labor's opposing this superannuation reform will mean for them. If you are a 25-year-old on $1,000 a week and receiving the SG, and if Labor is able to defeat these reforms, you will be worse off in retirement by $7,000 a year. If that same 25-year-old earning $1,000 took his lump sum, and if Labor succeeds in opposing this plan, his lump sum would be reduced by $37,000. Just in case you thought that it was only young people that Labor was against, a 65-year-old retiring with a $400,000 allocated pension under Labor's system would have their allocated pension reduced by $4,900 a year. If that same 65-year-old took their money in a lump sum, their lump sum would be reduced by $43,000.The young and the old stand to benefit from this superannuation plan. It has the support of IFSA, ASFA, AMP and the Institute of Actuaries. The only person who does not have the guts to stand up and back the government's reform is the Leader of the Opposition. He was warned about this by former senator Susan Ryan, who endorsed the government's plan. Not only did former senator Susan Ryan - a former Labor minister - endorse the government's plan but she finished off her article in the Australian on Friday, 12 May 2006 by saying:Maybe faced with the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but slightly shabby super property, the Opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out, and the wherewithal to let voters know about it.Maybe or maybe not - no big picture, no wherewithal, no leadership, no policy, no credibility and no support.</DOC>

 - No, of course they do not. And anybody who had any familiarity with the OECD would know that since 1994, when it introduced its job strategy, one of the things that it has been consistently advising developed economies to do is to remove barriers in their labour markets. One of the things that it has been consistently advising the Europeans in particular to do is to get rid of strong employment protection legislation - what we call 'unfair dismissal' laws - because unfair dismissal laws are a hamper on job creation. In fact, if the honourable member had listened to my answer yesterday, I actually read out -  -  - I know; it is funny, isn't it, that he would listen to anything. If only he had listened to the answer yesterday he would have heard me read out the very survey to which he refers. I read this quote:The link between the standards of employment protection legislation and aggregate unemployment is uncertain in theory and, in practice, highly dependent on specific national context. However, there is evidence that too strict legislation will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation.I repeat, 'There is evidence that too strict legislation will hamper labour mobility, reduce the dynamic efficiency of the economy and restrain job creation.' That is precisely what the OECD said. If you want further reassurance on the point, let us go to the IMF. The IMF has repeatedly said that Australia's industrial relations laws will enhance job creation and improve the economy. The IMF was so supportive of this government's reform that - get a load of this - the ACTU despatched a delegation to Washington to complain. Sharan Burrow went across to warn the IMF. - In IMF article 4, this is what the IMF said:There is now an exceptional opportunity to implement further reforms to sustain and improve Australia's strong economic performance. In particular ... by implementing proposed reforms of labour markets ... - Mr Speaker, I have been asked about the connection between industrial relations reform and economic growth and wage growth. That was the IMF's report in September 2000. The ACTU was so upset that Sharan Burrow went to Washington to complain to the IMF that the IMF was supporting labour market reform in Australia. 'We warn the Tsar!' - Sharan Burrow warns the IMF. The IMF not only dismissed her complaints but issued a new report redoubling the advice on the Australian economy. I will finish up by reading from the World Economic Outlook -  - The World Economic Outlook of April 2006 says this: 'In Australia, recent reforms to the industrial relations system and changes to tax and benefits systems will improve work incentives and should set the stage for strong employment growth.' So, you have the IMF, the World Economic Outlook and the OECD - experience all around the world - and, on the other side of the argument, you have the member for Lilley. - I have got to say: the member for Lilley and Sharan Burrow versus the OECD, the IMF and the World Economic Outlook - not a close race, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. As the Treasurer was pointing out to the House, a series of world economic bodies, including the IMF, have confirmed the workplace relations reforms as being part of the strength of the Australian economy over the past decade or so. Indeed, I noted that the managing director of the IMF, while in Australia this week, said something which the government knows and which the Leader of the Opposition is trying to ignore - that is, countries cannot prosper into the 21st century with workplace laws from the seventies, eighties and nineties. But that is where the Australian Labor Party wants to take Australia: back to the Keating era reforms.I was asked about proposals to roll back these reforms. It is interesting that, over the last few months - indeed, over the last year or so - the member for Perth has been running around the country privately intimating to business organisations -  - sort of nudge, nudge, wink, wink - that we are going to retain the system of individual contracts in Australian workplace agreements. - He has been running around Australia telling the business groups that. And, as he, this week, quite deliberately, pointedly and repeatedly said, when the Leader of the Opposition decided to repudiate this policy - and, in effect, repudiate the member for Perth - he did not even consult the member for Perth about this; he simply made a unilateral decision which he announced before the union bosses in Sydney last weekend. So this morning, the member for Perth, having been contradicted and embarrassed -  - This morning we had from the member for Perth one of the most outrageous attacks that I have heard of from a member of this place on the business organisations in Australia. Having been repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Perth was out at the doorstop this morning, taking out his anger on the business organisations in Australia. The first person he got stuck into was Michael Chaney, the head of the Business Council of Australia, whose only crime, it seems, was to write to the Leader of the Opposition and express the concern of the Business Council of Australia - the companies that employ some million Australians - about the Leader of the Opposition's roll back, his backflip, on Australian workplace agreements.Let us just look at this. Mr Chaney is somebody who has actually run businesses in Australia. Mr Chaney is someone who has actually created jobs for thousands of Australians and their families. That is unlike the member for Perth, whose main activity has been as a political apparatchik. So we had this extraordinary attack on the head of the Business Council of Australia by the member for Perth. -  - Not only do we have this extraordinary attack on the Business Council of Australia; also we have an extraordinary attack on the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, an organisation that represents the employers of some four million Australian people, saying that it was only interested in pushing down for lower wages. In fact, the member for Perth said in his doorstop, about the ACCI, 'Maybe it's about a lazy, easy way of increasing your profit.' This is an outrageous thing for a senior member of the opposition to be saying about a business organisation, the members of which employ some four million Australians. But the member for Perth went on and said, 'You should go and ask the business community this question: what flexibility do you get from statutory individual contracts that you can't get from common-law individual contracts?'If the member for Perth and the opposition do not know the difference between common-law contracts and individual AWAs then they are deeply in trouble, because the reality is that, as has been the law in Australia for some 90 years, common-law contracts do not replace awards. In fact, the ACCI pointed this out today in a press release. They said:Common law agreements do not deliver changes to working arrangements that are prohibited by awards or union agreements. They cannot do so because they are not allowed to alter (in any way) any of the terms of an award or a union agreement, no matter how inflexible, restrictive, inefficient, costly or inappropriate those terms might be to the situation of that employer and that employee.So the reality, when you decode what members of the opposition are saying, is that they are saying, 'Let's rip away the entitlements of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers on individual Australian workplace agreements.' The proposition from the Leader of the Opposition is to replace them with common-law contracts. In effect, he is saying to those hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families: 'We're going to take you back to the award conditions. We're going to take you back to conditions that pay 100 per cent less, on average, than do individual Australian workplace agreements.'As I said, if the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth do not know the difference between common-law contracts and Australian workplace agreements then they are in deep trouble. The member for Perth ought to apologise to the business organisations in Australia for his outrageous statements this morning. If he does not do so then the Leader of the Opposition should sack him. He has already repudiated him in any case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In answering this, I will restate the facts that I provided to the House yesterday. -  - The fact is that there was a ruptured pipe in a production process. This production process is the one that produces the radioisotopes for use by thousands of cancer sufferers across Australia each year. This ruptured pipe occurred almost half a kilometre away from the actual reactor. Yesterday I said that there would be no impact on the health of workers or the community, and that is absolutely correct. I am advised that in fact the incident was so minor that it is not deemed to be an incident reportable to the regulator -  - but the Australian nuclear science agency reported it anyway. Yesterday I said that there was no radiation threat. I am advised that the level of radiation was less than that normally in the atmosphere. It is less than that emitting from the granite used in this House. Yesterday I said that there was no measurable contamination. I am advised that the puff of inert gas was harmless -  - In fact, the air quality on that side of the House is more toxic. This is just blatant scaremongering by a Labor Party which is too scared to have a debate on nuclear power. It is just an attempt to discredit a valuable process, a valuable service for cancer patients - a lifesaving service. Labor is trying to discredit it. In relation to reportable incidents, the ignorance of the member for Jagajaga is astounding. The member for Jagajaga then left the chamber.  - The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation operates against world's best practice. It notifies the regulator within 24 hours. - The question I was asked this morning was whether there were other incidents that were not deemed notifiable that had not been notified, and I said that, no, there were not. Of course there have been incidents that have been notified. They were notified to the regulator. -  - I will start again. An incident -  - Ooh! Ooh, you're nasty. The member for Lilley then left the chamber. 
 - ANSTO notifies the regulator, the regulator notifies parliament, and that is the end of the matter.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question and her interest. I think that the highlight I should refer to in answering her question is the death last week of the al-Qaeda terrorist al-Zarqawi. We congratulate the Prime Minister of Iraq, the Iraqi defence forces and the United States forces on the job they did in tracking down this terrorist - this brutal and cruel man - and finally bringing him to justice. He was the mastermind of terrorism in Iraq, and he was also, I think, a very effective manipulator of the Western media. Whilst one normally would not express pleasure at the death of anybody, the death of a terrorist like that is a good thing.The al-Qaeda backed terrorists in Iraq will continue to try to kill people, and some of the insurgents will continue to try to kill people. But the view of this government is that we should do all we reasonably can and, more importantly, the international community should do all it can to ensure that the forces of freedom and democracy in Iraq are successful and that terrorists and the insurgents are defeated. When President Bush was in Iraq a couple of days ago, he said that 'Iraq is a central front' in the war on terror and that America would keep its commitments. I commend not just the international forces and our own forces but also - in a way more importantly - the people of Iraq for their determination to stand up to terrorism and their determination to make sure that their democracy and their freedom succeeds in the teeth of those terrorists.There are alternative views in this country. We give our commitment to see through this task. The opposition has an alternative view. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked on 9 June in a doorstop what he thought about the death of al-Zarqawi, he said that the war in Iraq is 'a major distraction' in the war on terror. In other words, the international community should pull out of Iraq and leave that country in the hands of the insurgents and the terrorists. That is the position of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who has endeavoured to convince commentators that he has some sort of knowledge of and expertise on international strategic issues. In other words, the world would be better off if the insurgents and the terrorists were successful in Iraq. - We would be better off if we hauled up the white flag and were defeated. We would not be better off if we were defeated -  - we would be better off if we won. We would be better off if the terrorists were defeated in Iraq. This government will never be defeatist and it will never step backwards in its determination to support the international community in Iraq. But the Leader of the Opposition leads a political party which has a candidate in Victoria called Khalil Eideh. Khalil Eideh is a man who speaks of 'colonial' and 'Zionist' plots to 'enslave the Arab world' and praises the work of 'Arab martyrs'. If the Leader of the Opposition were a person of strength and courage, he would ensure that this Labor candidate was disendorsed. This is not a candidate who articulates the courageous views of the mainstream of Australia. The mainstream of Australia denounces and stands up to these people.Labor have a candidate they are running in the Victorian election - some sort of multimillionaire candidate they are enormously proud of - who apparently talks about 'Arab martyrs' and how there are 'Zionist' plans to 'enslave the Arab world'. I think we have heard that language somewhere else. Now we hear that language from the Australian Labor Party - the party that wants to haul up the white flag in Iraq, the party that wants to roll over in the teeth of terrorists. The Leader of the Opposition should show some courage and get this man disendorsed.</DOC>

There is a regulator in place - the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. - We know what this is about.

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for his question. I acknowledge his concerns and I pay tribute to the work that he has done with the Indigenous people of his electorate, particularly in conjunction with Dick Estens in Moree to improve their employment outcomes. The fact that Indigenous life expectancy remains about 20 years below that of the general community should trouble every member of this House, notwithstanding the significant improvements in Indigenous mortality achieved in the last few years. Although Indigenous ill health has many causes, better health services are certainly essential if things are to improve.Since 1996, the Howard government has increased Indigenous-specific health spending from about $100 million to about $350 million a year. The recent budget committed an additional $137 million over the forward estimates period. In particular, the government will spend $40 million to get an additional 80 health professionals or their equivalents working with Aboriginal people in both Aboriginal and mainstream health services; it will spend $21 million training over 1,200 Aboriginal health workers to better recognise and deal with mental health problems; it will spend $20 million converting 130 part-time positions into full-time jobs with Indigenous health services; and, perhaps most importantly, it will spend an additional $55 million to combat the scourge of petrol sniffing in Central Australia and other remote settlements, which will mean targeting and removing petrol sniffers from affected communities and also extending the roll-out of the unsniffable OPAL petrol.As members of this House on both sides would know, there is no panacea for these difficulties. It is, I regret to say, easy to spend money but not easy to get outcomes. However, this government certainly will not hesitate to invest in programs that it is confident will work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. He will be interested to know that the Australian government has increased funding to Australian schools by some 116 per cent in the 10 years that the Howard government has been in office. For example, in the ACT that increase has been 96 per cent. This year, some $49.2 million will be provided to government schools in the ACT. In addition, we have provided some $7½ million under the Investing in our Schools program to government schools in the Australian Capital Territory.I have been asked about how this money is being spent. If we look at the Australian Capital Territory, we find that Labor is in fact closing 39 government schools in the ACT. It has been revealed today that Jon Stanhope and the education minister, Andrew Barr, want to kick out what they call 'out of area' enrolments. They want to kick students out of schools that they say are out of area. The member for Hume will know that that means children from New South Wales are going to be kicked out, by Labor, of Australian Capital Territory schools. This is outrageous. Labor wants to kick out of school children whose parents want to vote against them at the next election. These parents pay their federal government taxes. In fact, $7½ million of their money has been paid to schools in the ACT, and now Labor wants to kick out their kids. In the Hall Primary School, which is right on the New South Wales border, the federal government, for example, has paid $88,000 for a shade structure for the children in that school, and now Stanhope and Barr want to close down the school.Labor had the gall to launch a website entitled '100s of reasons to live in Canberra', and one of the reasons is the 60 schools - less the schools that they are closing. I can think of two good reasons why you would not want to live in Canberra - Jon Stanhope and Andrew Barr. The members opposite ought to call on the ACT Labor government to save these schools or pay back the money.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The answer is yes. The latest example appears to have been the member for Perth in relation to a company called Esselte, and I seek the permission of the House to take the House through some of the detail of this. Last Thursday in this place the member for Perth, brandishing what was purported to be an AWA, asked the following question:Isn't it the case that this AWA leaves a full-time employee - of Esselte - working a Saturday shift $65 a week, or $10,140 over three years, worse off?That was the claim. According to a statement from the company, released today, the facts are different from those suggested by the member for Perth. Amongst other things this is what the company had to say:The management of Esselte understands that the $65 pay cut allegation was raised in connection with Saturday work. Esselte does not regularly work any of its employees on a Saturday.It went on to say:Esselte has never engaged a person to work their regular hours on a Saturday.So, on the basis of the member for Perth's claim, that particular claim is false. Further, Esselte said:At certain times of the year, due to increases in warehouse volumes, the existing full-time warehouse staff are asked to work Saturdays on an as-required basis. This Saturday work is voluntary and has always been in addition to the employee's week hours and is worked at overtime rates of pay.The AWA that was offered to Esselte staff increased the minimum hourly rate to $18.39 an hour, compared with the collective agreement of $17.39 an hour, and also compared with the relevant award, which had a rate of $13.78 an hour. On the basis of a calculation along the lines of that made by the member for Perth of an employee working 38 ordinary hours and three hours overtime, they would actually be $27 a week better off, not $65 a week worse off, and $4,000 better off over the three-year period.I understand that the agreement offered included increases in wages, increases in some allowances and an increase in sick leave provisions. On Saturday, one of Australia's most respected union figures, Mr Joe de Bruyn, had something to say about people taking liberties with the truth in the industrial relations debate. That was referring to Spotlight; it may well also have referred to Esselte.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Perth, let me simply say this: Joe de Bruyn pinned you, and nothing you can say alters that fact. - I would like the member for Perth to address the case. I would like the member for Perth to explain to the House how it is that he can get up and make an allegation that somebody is $65 a week worse off when, with a bit of research based on what the company has said, that person is in fact $27 a week better off. That kind of misrepresentation is of a piece with the misrepresentation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was trying to establish that Teys Bros were deliberately refusing to give Aussie workers a job, when in reality they had not only advertised but also gone to the union and asked the union to provide some Australian workers, and the union could not do so. What the opposition is doing on this issue is deliberately distorting the facts in order to create fear and hostility in the community. - They always do that. They did it with the GST and it failed. They are doing it with this. I reckon they are going to fail on this as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The member for Barker would recognise the significance of productivity growth to our competitiveness in the international marketplace. Our competitive edge relies very heavily on productivity growth. We have had productivity growth over the last 10 or so years in the Australian economy, and it has helped us achieve $177 billion worth of exports last year - very relevant in the member's electorate of Barker.The policy being proposed by the Australian Labor Party to rip up Australian workplace agreements would clearly undermine all those productivity gains, as a result of which we have enjoyed growth in our economy. They would be unbelievably irresponsible policies if they were to be implemented. We have heard many comments from different industries that are supporting the current government's position on industrial relations. The mining industry alone says it will take a $6.6 billion hit to productivity every year if it cannot use AWAs. The mining industry is leading Australia's export growth. The agriculture sector, which competes with the mining sector for employment and employees, says that its ability to keep good people in its industry would seriously suffer if it could not use AWAs to match employment opportunities with employee wishes.The Leader of the Opposition wants to roll back the industrial relations system in Australia to the bad old days, when the union movement held the country to ransom. We all remember these great examples in our industrial relations history. We remember the days when our minerals exports were brought to a halt over strikes about what type of ice-cream was sold in a canteen on a mine site. That took place in Robe River. We remember the days when export abattoirs like Mudginberri were shut down by the unions even after the employer had won the case in the Industrial Relations Commission.Labor's way of running the economy in the 1980s was no way to run the economy. Our economy then was about a quarter of the size it is now. The government and the Treasurer will deliver an economy in the next 12 months worth about a trillion dollars. Labor's industrial relations policy is no way to take that forward. It would completely undermine productivity in the workplace and therefore undermine growth in the economy.I will finish with a quote from Access Economics, back in 2004, about the preferred economic model of the Australian Labor Party. Access Economics had a close look at Labor's industrial relations policy back then and concluded:The likely outcome is lower productivity growth and less accurate matching of wages and productivity at the enterprise level.For our economy to continue to grow and expand we have to be able to compete and we have to be competitive at home and abroad.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I thought the news conference delivered by my colleague on Saturday was a very good news conference. He is, along with other members of this government, a great believer in wage increases. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition what I think is a good wage increase, not wage cut. A good wage increase is about 16.8 per cent in real terms over 10 years. That is a very good one. I will tell you what is a bad real wage increase: 1.3 per cent over 13 years, because that is the real comparison. Can I finally say - again - that Mr de Bruyn is a union figure for whom I have considerable respect. I think he is a very good man. We do not agree on everything, but he is a very fair man and that is why he was disturbed by the way in which some of the Leader of the Opposition's frontbench colleagues were distorting the truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and look forward to his own contribution to the birth rate next month - and we thank him for doing his duty. There are reports in today's newspapers that 1 July 2004 was a record day for the number of births in Australia, which was the day of course that the maternity payment, or baby bonus, was introduced. Medical advice is that no-one should delay the delivery of a child, which would put either the mother's or the child's health at risk. But 1 July 2004 was the day that the maternity payment, or baby bonus, was introduced and it was in the sum of $3,000. Since then the sum has been indexed and increased and currently stands at $3,166, and on 1 July the maternity payment, or baby bonus, will be increasing to $4,000 for children that are born after that date. The government has also announced another increase - on 1 July 2008, when the maternity payment, or baby bonus, will increase to $5,000.Whether it is the introduction of the baby bonus, whether it is the $600 increase in the family tax benefit - remember that payment that 'did not exist': it seems to be paid to millions of Australians - whether it is the changes in the taper rate for family tax benefit or whether it is the record number of child-care places that are being delivered under this government, the good news is that for calendar year 2004 Australia recorded the highest number of births in 12 years, the highest since 1992. In fact, for the year ended 31 December 2005 there were 261,400 births in Australia, a 2.4 per cent increase on 2004.It seems that many Australians are taking up the challenge to have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country, and that is a positive thing for Australia. It is a positive thing for Australia because it represents confidence in our future. It is a positive thing for Australia because with an ageing of the population an increase in the fertility rate over the long term - not in the short term but over the long term - will do something to deflect the problems of the ageing of the population in 2040, 2050 and beyond. So the family-friendly policies of this government are helping millions of Australian families. There is a welcome pick-up in the birth rate in Australia and we would encourage many more Australians to benefit from this government's family-friendly policies.</DOC>

 - I did see the remarks attributed to His Eminence, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, last night on television. Let me say that I do not entertain the concerns expressed by the Cardinal. The basis of that is that this government has been a good friend of the low paid in this country. I might say that measured by some of the principles of both more broadly Christian social justice and more specifically Catholic social justice, this government has been a good friend of the low paid in the Australian community. In fact, more Australians have jobs under this government than was the case 10 years ago.It is true that the rich have got richer in this country over the last 10 years, but they have not got richer at the expense of the poor. Most of the studies that have been carried out produce evidence on some occasions - indeed, to the great surprise of the researchers - that the low paid enjoy a higher relative increase in their position than people in the middle and at the upper end. Any fair analysis of our family benefits system will reveal that low-paid, single-income families, including single parents, have, relatively speaking, been the best endowed of all as a result of the family tax benefit and welfare policies that have been introduced.I remind all of those who follow this debate that, when we introduced our industrial relations reforms 10 years ago, people said that all sorts of terrible things were going to occur. They have not occurred. In fact, we have seen real wages go up by 16.8 per cent, we have seen unemployment fall to a 30-year low and we have seen 1.8 million new jobs created. It is my confident prediction that, just as the doomsaying of the Labor Party 10 years ago was proved wrong, so the doomsaying of the Labor Party in 2006 will by 2016, and through the 10 years to then, also be proved wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his interest in this subject. I can inform him and the House that there are significant protections available for workers in Australia under the Work Choices legislation - in particular, the significant increase in funding to the Office of Workplace Services in this regard.It is interesting in this light that the ACTU have been using workers in their advertising that they claim to be victims of Work Choices. The reality is that the Office of Workplace Services has power to enforce compliance with the Workplace Relations Act. It has staff trained, and additional staff who have been brought on board, to do that and who have been appointed as workplace inspectors. They have power to go into workplaces, to require the production of documents and the giving of evidence about a range of matters and to take action on behalf of employees against employers where they find that there is a need to do so.Despite the ads that have been run, the very interesting thing to note is that the unions have not referred a single one of the people featured in these advertisements to the Office of Workplace Services. Not only that, the ACTU on its website does not refer workers who have a complaint to the Office of Workplace Services, despite the fact that significant resources are there for workers to make a complaint if they believe they have been hard done by.The Labor Party and the unions claim that they have the interest of workers at heart. If that were true, they would stop playing politics with these people and refer these cases to the Office of Workplace Services. There is no clearer indication that this is simply a matter of the unions and the Labor Party playing politics. If they did have the interests of these workers at heart, they would refer them to the Office of Workplace Services, where a proper investigation could be carried out.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, through you to the member for Banks, there is no low pay commission that I am aware of. I am very happy to engage with the member for Banks on these matters. He is a hardworking member and a good member. Let me simply say, though: don't be deluded into asking questions -  - based on false assertions. I would say to the member for Banks, by all means engage in vigorous debate, but do not be lured by the tactics committee into making false statements; otherwise, Joe de Bruyn will have a go at you as well. That is what will happen. And if Joe gets amongst some of the branches in Banks you never know what might happen, because he does not have a bad track record. I have made this remark before and I will say it again: people ask me for guarantees - my guarantee is my record. My record is of somebody who has led a government that has presided over huge increases in real wages and who has presided over the introduction of a tax and welfare system which I think, compared with the tax and welfare systems of other governments, has been far closer to the aspirations of Christian and specifically Catholic social justice than have been the programs of other governments. I am very proud of that record. I always welcome the contributions to public debate made by that very eminent, ecclesiastical figure, Cardinal George Pell, for whom I have great regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his obvious interest in this issue. He is obviously acutely aware that the unfortunate reality is that for decades many Indigenous Australians, particularly but not exclusively in the Territory, have been locked out of owning their own home, a right that the rest of us enjoy. They have also been locked out of being able to own their own businesses in the place where they live. This of course has led to them living in what many people would now recognise as little communist enclaves, where money comes in - they cannot own anything, they cannot run a business, they cannot own their own home - and where someone else determines who owns the house.This government has before the House the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill, which, amongst other things, will provide for 99-year lease-backs of town centres to allow a headlease to be provided to the Northern Territory government and for Aboriginal people, for the first time, to be able to own their own property in these places, build their own home, build their own businesses and build their own future for themselves and their families.I am asked about comments and people's views. I can inform the member for Solomon that last month I went to Nguiu in the Tiwi Islands and spoke with the people about a 99-year lease-back of the township of Nguiu so they could benefit from this legislation. They signed a heads of agreement there. They saw it as a new beginning for their people and their children so that they could join in the market economy like other Australians. Over the weekend I went back to the Territory. I went to Galiwinku and sat down with the traditional owners and said to them, 'This is what the Commonwealth is proposing to do.' We talked through the many issues of a headlease. Can I tell the House how excited they were and how engaged they were in the opportunity for the first time of being able to own something of their own. It is not understood by many people that many of the Aboriginal people who live in Galiwinku are not traditional owners. They do not have the rights of a traditional owner in the place where they currently reside because they were displaced from their own lands many years ago.I then travelled on Sunday to Wadeye, an area which has been in the press quite a bit. I sat down with some of the leaders in some of the remote communities, such as Wudapuli, which is an outstation, and spoke about how they could also own their own homes in the land that they wish to occupy, where their children could go to school and where they could have the rights of other Australians. They, too, embraced this idea.In the political arena, we have had eminent people like the National President of the ALP, Warren Mundine, warmly welcoming these initiatives and I appreciate his support. We also have in the Northern Territory the Hon. Elliott McAdam, Minister for Housing, who, in the Sunday Territorian, said:Not everyone in Aboriginal communities is going to be in a position to own their own home, but the important thing is that people will now have a choice.And he is right. This legislation is about providing a choice to Aboriginal people that has been denied to them through collective ownership up to this day. Unfortunately, there are still some people - not all of them, I might add - whose spokesman, Senator Chris Evans, on 13 June made a statement -  - It is sad that the honourable member opposite does not want to hear what his own party has to say about this particular issue. This consultation has gone on for nine years, and the only people who seem to continually have their head in the sand are some of those who sit opposite. And I deliberately use the word 'some' because some people, like the President of the ALP, see that in the past it has failed and a new way is needed and that being part of the market economy and having the right to own your own home should apply right across Australia. But the Labor Party, in a statement on 13 June, said, 'Labor will not support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill in its current form.' The most controversial part of the bill includes the 99-year leasing provisions. There is nothing controversial about giving Aboriginal Australians the same rights the rest of us have and have had for a very long time. I ask the federal Australian Labor Party to support their Territorian colleagues, get their head out of the sand and support Australian Aboriginals having the same rights as the rest of us.</DOC>

 - I have seen a report of that case and I might make the observation -  - that it appears to have been a decision made in relation to matters that occurred under the law that operated before Work Choices was introduced. In accordance with my well-established practice - a practice the wisdom of which has been borne out on at least three or four occasions over the last week - I will examine the detail of the case. I will examine the detail of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition and have something further to say about it, because I think I am justified in saying, on the track record of the member for Perth and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you cannot always believe what the opposition say at question time with their questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper and acknowledge his tremendous interest in this issue and his undying determination to have something done about upgrading the Pacific Highway through his own electorate and through the whole of coastal northern New South Wales. I know he will be particularly pleased that, at long last, a contract was let at the end of last month for the Bonville deviation. That is a part of the $4.9 billion that this government is making available to New South Wales over the five years of AusLink. This includes close to $3 billion for major land transport construction projects - a 171 per cent increase on what was available over the previous five years. That is starting to make a real difference. Of course, on budget night there was $800 million provided for the Hume Highway in addition to what had previously been included in AusLink and another $160 million for the Pacific Highway. The details of those projects will be announced very shortly.The reality is that this government is getting on with the job in New South Wales of trying to do something about upgrading the state's road system. We do not get a lot of cooperation from the state government, who can find all sorts of reasons why projects should be delayed. There are any number of examples. I know the honourable member for Riverina talks often about the Coolac bypass, where, a year after tenders closed, work still has not started.I was really interested in the New South Wales budget handed down the other week, which actually listed 10 projects under AusLink which it described as being 'jointly funded by the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments'. Of these 10 projects, six are in fact 100 per cent funded by the Australian government, with not a cent required of New South Wales and not a cent provided. The other four may require a 20 per cent or 50 per cent contribution from New South Wales, but the money included in the New South Wales budget was only the Commonwealth share. The New South Wales share of the money was left out altogether.That is the kind of approach and the lack of cooperation that we so often get from New South Wales when it comes to dealing with road-upgrading projects - the black, green and red tape, the bureaucratic inertia and the policy analysis mean that the money piles up and projects do not get built. So it was really refreshing over the weekend to hear the New South Wales coalition state that, when they are elected to government after the next election in New South Wales, they will commit to work cooperatively with the federal government to get on with the task. They are going to stop the blaming and they are going to work constructively. What a refreshing change it will be to have a government that wants to work with the Commonwealth government to make sure that these vital road projects in New South Wales are actually built.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Bendigo: it is not correct to say that we do not have monitoring. We do have monitoring and there was, in fact, monitoring that was carried out in the lead-up to the Queen's Birthday weekend. That monitoring produced the outcome that was consistent with monitoring of similar events on other occasions, and that is that the discounting of the retail price which takes place during the week because of the higher volume demands at the weekend disappears. That results in the alteration in the price.I know, as the member for Bendigo knows and I think everybody in this country knows, that the price of petrol is painfully high. It is, however, of no help to sensible debate and no help to the hard-pressed Australian motorist for false claims to be made and false dawns to be offered in relation to how you can cut the price. It is due overwhelmingly to the high price of crude oil. If there had been a solution, that solution would have been lighted upon and implemented with enormous enthusiasm long before now. But I can assure the member for Bendigo that, if there are other productive things that can be done in relation to price monitoring, the government stands ready to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his very important question. It is a very relevant question in the light of an article that appeared on the front page of the Melbourne Herald Sun today, apparently based on a claim made by the member for Wills, which in turn was in part informed by some research carried out by the Parliamentary Library. In essence, what was claimed in the article was that, since the introduction of the GST, some $10 billion in GST revenue has been collected yet only about $4.6 billion has been forgone in excise; whereas the government claimed in 2001 that, when introducing the GST, it would adjust the excise so as to ensure that there was no additional revenue collected.The claim being made is false. It is false because, in the calculations that have been made, no allowance has been made for the two discretionary reductions in fuel excise that were made in 2000 and 2001. There was a reduction in excise of 6.7c per litre on the introduction of the GST and there was a further reduction of 1.5c in March 2001, which produces a combined reduction of 8.2c a litre. In addition to that, the abolition of fuel excise indexation in March 2001 has resulted in cumulative savings in relation to excise of something in the order of $1.4 billion.So when you carry all of that together, when you allow for the two discretionary reductions and the removal of the excise, you have a situation where the excise forgone is about $11.5 billion. The estimate in the Herald article of GST is $10 billion. So, on the basis of that, there has been no overcollection, and in fact the government has kept faith with its commitment that the introduction of the GST would not result in an increase in the overall tax collected on petrol.I end my answer by making, in any event, the observation that if people, including the member for Wills, believe that too much GST is being collected from petrol, they might like to drop down to Treasury Place - not the Commonwealth end of Treasury Place but the Victorian government end of Treasury Place - and have a word with Mr Bracks about coughing up some of that $1.5 billion extra that the states appear to have got.</DOC>

This is a matter which is being brought to my attention not just by this question in this House but also by the member for Gwydir, who has made regular representations to me on this. I have also had some discussions on this with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England, the former head of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I think they have put in a good application. The government is certainly considering it. The information about the latest developments from the New South Wales government is interesting and constructive. I think that this is something that would be a positive for rural health.I should point out in conclusion to the member for New England that the policies which the government has already put in place have, around Australia, if not necessarily in every rural community, produced an increase in the number of GPs of over 20 per cent since 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. It is a very important day for the people of Gilmore, as it is for Australians. This morning the Prime Minister announced on behalf of the government that the government will acquire 34 further multirole helicopters, the so-called MRH90 helicopters. These will add to the 12 that the government decided to purchase in August 2004. These 46 helicopters will replace the Black Hawk helicopters. They will also replace the Sea King helicopters. The first of them will arrive at HMAS Albatross in the electorate of Gilmore in 2010.This is a well-developed helicopter at a cost, ultimately, of $2.7 billion for these 34 and $1½ billion for the earlier 12. More than $4 billion is being invested in seeing that the next generation of air capability in Australia delivers Australia with good air combat capability to support special services, to provide helicopter air lift, to support our activities currently being done by the Sea King in rescuing people at sea and other important things and to support the civilian community in Australia.This package includes $1.2 billion in specific support to Australian industry in terms of composite construction, aerospace avionics, software development and engine production. The first two will come from France in December next year. The next three will come the following year, and the first of those will be off the Australian production line in Brisbane. There will be 350 Australian jobs supported directly by this decision. It is yet more evidence of the two things the government has been determined to do in defence: to provide very strong political will for the defence and security of Australia and to see that Australia runs a very strong economy so Australia is in a position to be able to afford to protect itself, its borders and its interests in the region and throughout the world.</DOC>

In fact, since becoming Special Minister of State I have been quite surprised at the number of changes that take place with respect to electorate offices, and it happens right across the board. Circumstances change, electorates change, responsibilities change -  
A government member - Senators change. - and senators change - exactly. Senators change as well.

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for the question and I know how concerned he is to try to ensure better living conditions for people in the remote Indigenous communities in his electorate. I think it is important to keep the House informed on this issue because of the great public interest that it has generated. But it is important to dwell not just on the extent of addiction but also on the determination of local Indigenous people to make a difference, because they can see how these substances are poisoning their kids.In the recent budget the government did commit $55 million to combat petrol sniffing and other substance abuse in Indigenous townships and settlements. This includes $20 million that has been earmarked to roll out the unsniffable Opal petrol to an additional 33 sites, including 15 roadhouses that are close to Indigenous townships. That will take to 92 the total number of sites around Australia where unsniffable Opal petrol is available. The budget commitment also includes $15 million to support community patrols and community justice groups and also youth recreation programs, because it is important to make sniffing less attractive as well as harder to do.All of this can work. For instance, I am advised that since Opal was put into the Papunya community the number of petrol sniffers has dropped from about 60 to almost zero, according to the community council chairman. But there are quite a few problems in this area. I have recently been advised that kava abuse is now a problem in up to eight Aboriginal townships in Arnhem Land. The government is currently working with the Northern Territory to try to address this issue. Unfortunately, there are no magic bullets here. Alienation and directionlessness do not dissipate overnight. But the government is determined to make the investments necessary. The government will not hesitate to make the investments necessary where we think there are programs which are reasonably capable of making a difference.</DOC>

I notice the Labor Party have not given the current member for Isaacs much support, which will be to the great detriment of the Labor Party, I think, because I think she has been a good member. She was certainly a very good Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation when I chaired it. But, as I said, circumstances do change and it is necessary for members and senators to relocate their electorate offices. We try to get the best deal that we can. The individual members and senators work closely with the department to get the best deal. We try to minimise the amount of excess rent sometimes when things have to change, and this happens -  - I can probably trot out the names of a few Labor members and senators and what it has cost to relocate their offices -  - if the member would like. I do not have the exact dollar figure for that right here at the moment, but I am very happy to get the actual dollar figures and come back to the parliament - and I might provide a few dollar figures of other changes as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question, because there is continuing interest in the situation of national security. Last week I tabled a report on the Security Legislation Review Committee that was chaired by a retired judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Simon Sheller. The committee was established to review the operation, effectiveness and implication of the package of measures that were implemented in 2002. That report recognised that the current level of threat to Australia and Australian interests from terrorist activity justified the continuing need for our strong counter-terrorism laws. As the Age editorial today correctly points out, the report also found that there had been no excessive or improper use of Australia's counter-terrorism laws.Of course the government will consider very carefully the recommendations of the review, but we have formed a preliminary view on several key issues. It is appropriate that I should outline what those matters were, as I did last Friday. We believe very firmly that the listing of terrorist organisations is open and transparent as a process with sufficient safeguards and with parliamentary oversight. The power has been used on some 19 occasions, and I was satisfied at the time, and I remain satisfied, that each of the 19 organisations meet the criteria for listing. Based on advice from our intelligence organisations, each of them is assessed to have engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering a terrorist act. I might say it has nothing to do with any religious faith or cause which members or adherents might have.The government believes concern expressed by the committee about the offensive association is also unfounded. The idea that it interferes with ordinary family, religious or legal communication ignores the fact that provisions in the law now explicitly exempt associations with close family members and associations for the purpose of religious worship and for the provision of humanitarian advice and legal advice. The government does remain committed to engaging with the community on security issues explaining the legislation to all members of the community. We will continue to denounce terrorism and all those who support it or promote it directly or by association.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by the business community of Australia. Last week the Mines and Minerals Association of Western Australia stated that removing Australian workplace agreements would cost the mining industry over $6 billion. Austral Ships, one of the absolutely premier examples of Australian inventiveness and capacity, which employs over 1,000 Australians in Western Australia, said last week:This would not be here in Western Australia under a collective agreement. Our productivity would be nowhere near high enough. We would not be able to survive.Michael Chaney, the Chairman of the Business Council of Australia, said that the policy announced by the Leader of the Opposition misses the fundamental point that AWAs have played a significant part in improving productivity. Today, the national body, the Minerals Council of Australia, in a news release called for Labor to reconsider the proposed workplace reforms because they are 'ill-conceived and potentially detrimental to the long-term viability of the Australian minerals industry'. These are not the words of somebody uninterested in the great resource sector of Australia; these are the words of the Minerals Council of Australia. The Minerals Council's companies produce more than 85 per cent of Australia's annual minerals output.Every time I see the member for Perth interviewed on the issue of industrial relations productivity, he says, 'It is all due to the boom in the mining industry.' Well, if it is all due to the boom in the mining industry, why is the Labor Party trying to lower the boom on the mining industry? Basically, that is what the Labor Party is trying to do - it is trying to lower the boom on the boom. That is a monumentally counterproductive thing to do for the future of this country. The Minerals Council went on to say - and these words could well echo the views of many on the Labor Party front bench, who regarded the announcement made last week by the Leader of the Opposition as a sell-out to some gangsters in Sydney:The MCA is deeply concerned by the ALP's proposal to abolish Australian workplace agreements, re-invigorate collective bargaining, strengthen the award system and reposition unions as an external third party in negotiating terms and conditions. The impressive transformation of the minerals sector over the last decade is in part due to flexible workplace laws transforming work practices, pay and conditions and productivity in the mining industry.They are the words of an industry which is part of the great 21st century wealth of this country. They are words of advice that the Leader of the Opposition would do well to listen to and heed.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. Let me give a guarantee. In addition to reminding the Australian people of my record, let me give this guarantee. I can guarantee that wages will always be higher, unemployment will always be lower, productivity will always be higher and growth will always be stronger under a coalition government than under a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I am aware of some further plans. I was not aware of them until I read my copy of the West Australian newspaper, which I did with great interest this morning, but I am aware of some further plans by courtesy of Unions Western Australia secretary, Dave Robinson. Dave very helpfully had something revealing to say about his plans to further regulate the Australian economy. Let me set the scene for Dave. We are all aware of the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to abolish Australian workplace agreements. We are all aware of course that in the Sydney Morning Herald at the weekend a Labor Party frontbencher 'described it as a gutless rollover to appease a mob of gangsters in Sydney'. And we are all aware of the fact that Australians do better under AWAs than they do under collective agreements and awards - far better; according to the ABS, by about 13 per cent compared to collective agreements.We are also told by the Leader of the Opposition - I think we were told this by him at the ALP conference - that what would happen if he became Prime Minister would be that he would not allow any new AWAs; he would allow the existing ones to run their course. In less than a week, the friendly Dave from Western Australia has belled the cat on that one. What Dave has really told us is that:Under a Labor government, only employers who had genuine agreements with staff would be able to maintain their agreement until the AWA's expiry date.In other words, according to the unions who run Labor policy on this issue, not only will there be no new AWAs but, even in relation to the existing AWAs, if Mr Beazley becomes the Prime Minister, according to Dave what will happen is that the unions will run a ruler over the existing AWAs, and those they do not like they will tell the newly elected Labor government to knock out. So I look forward to reading my copy of the West Australian tomorrow to get the latest instalment on Dave Robinson's plan to reregulate the Australian labour market.</DOC>

 - I must confess, in reply to the question asked by the honourable member, that I am at a distinct disadvantage because I do not get invited to meetings of the Labor Party's IR task force. I am quite certain that if I were invited to meetings of the task force I would be able to inject a bit of intellectual rigour into what they are debating. And do you know what I would ask that person and also the gentleman referred to in the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition? I would ask those gentlemen: do you recall 17 per cent interest rates? Do you recall that in 1996 industrial disputes were monumentally higher? - I was asked about the proceedings of the ALP's industrial relations task force and I was suggesting, Mr Speaker, that if they asked the right questions they would get completely objective answers. As for the questions that ought to be asked, they ought to be asked: what has happened to productivity? What has happened to employment? What has happened to taxation? What has happened to interest rates? What has happened to the general prosperity of Australia? What has happened to real wages? I would be asking what the real wage rise was between 1983 and 1996. I would have to truthfully answer, if I were a member, '1.3 per cent'. I would ask what it was between 1996 and 2006. Truthfully, I would have to say '16.8 per cent'. I have finished my answer, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. The government is very concerned by reports that North Korea may be preparing to test-launch a long-range missile, which we would view as a highly provocative act that would only isolate North Korea further. A long-range missile test would be contrary to North Korea's September 2005 joint statement pledge to maintain peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in North-East Asia at large. On Friday we called in the North Korean Ambassador, Ambassador Chon, as a result of action the DPRK was taking to prepare for the launch of a long-range missile. We called him in again yesterday, after further international concerns were raised, and underlined the serious consequences that would follow any launch. We will continue to work closely with our allies and friends to persuade North Korea to maintain its 1999 self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile testing.North Korea is gravely mistaken if it thinks a long-range missile test would improve its security or its bargaining position at the six-party talks. We call upon it to re-engage immediately and without condition. A missile test would place additional strain on an already deadlocked six-party process and would cast serious doubt on North Korea's willingness to engage the international community and move towards denuclearisation. North Korea's track record on missile exports adds to concerns about its development of long-range missiles. Australia continues to play an active role in combating missile proliferation, including through participation in the missile technology control regime. The government calls on North Korea to back away from preparations for a long-range missile test launch and return to the six-party talks without precondition.</DOC>

 - We have not misled the Australian people and nor have we misled the parliament. The person who has done the misleading is, in fact, the member for Perth. - I remind the member for Perth that the AWA offered to Esselte staff increased the minimum hourly rate to $18.39 an hour -  - compared to the collective agreement rate of $17.13. This was said in the parliament yesterday. - On this basis, a calculation along the lines of that made by the member for Perth shows an employee working 38 ordinary hours and three hours overtime would actually be $27 a week better off and over $4,000 better off over three years. The member for Perth asks me to release the calculations. I have just repeated them; I do not need to release them. Self-evidently, the member for Perth has been caught out telling porkies. He said, '$65 a week worse off', '$27 a week better off'. - He is arithmetically challenged to the tune of $92 a week. He is the person who has been telling the porky. He has been caught out. You do not have to be very bright to work out from those calculations that the member for Perth has been caught out again.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can inform him that in two weeks time, on 1 July, every Australian paying income tax will receive an income tax cut as a result of this year's budget. Low-income earners will benefit from an increase in the low-income tax offset so that they will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000. Those on the lowest tax rate of 15 per cent will not go into a higher tax bracket until their taxable income goes past $25,000. Those on the 30 per cent tax rate will not pay a higher marginal tax until their taxable income goes past $75,000. For those on the two top tax rates, both the rate is cut and the threshold is increased so that the 42c rate is cut to 40c and applies to those on incomes between $75,000 and $150,000 and those on the top rate have a reduced top rate of 45c in the dollar and it applies only to each dollar of income over $150,000. That means that, from the lowest paid to the upper income earners, every Australian will receive an income tax cut from 1 July - the beginning of next month.These tax cuts follow on from the tax cuts in the A New Tax System, which was introduced in 2000. They follow on from a round of tax cuts in the 2003 budget of $2.4 billion per year, tax cuts in the 2004 budget of $14.7 billion over four years and tax cuts in the 2005 budget of $21 billion over four years. These tax cuts, which start on 1 July, total $36.7 billion over four years. This compares favourably to those of previous governments. The last Labor government did not fulfil its promise to cut taxes even though it put them into legislation before the 1993 election. Not only could you not believe what the Labor Party said; you could not rely on the legislation of the Labor Party, which legislated tax cuts before the 1993 election and then took them back. Mr Keating, the then Prime Minister, famously said, 'They are not a promise; they are l-a-w.' But they turned into a complete falsehood, of which the current Leader of the Opposition was very much a part.From 1 July 2006, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Under the tax scales announced in the 2006 budget, a person on average weekly earnings will pay $1,209 less than they would have under an indexed 1995-96 scale. Let me repeat that: if we had indexed the 1996 scales to CPI, a person on average weekly earnings would have paid $1,209 more than they will pay from 1 July. This government has been able to run economic policy, to manage the economy, to cut taxes and to give Australians opportunity at work. The Labor Party has fought us every step of the way. Labor is the anti-reform party of Australian politics, and the Australian people would be worse off under its policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. I can inform her that the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, continues to take successful action against corporate wrongdoers. Last week ASIC banned two Melbourne directors who were associated with an unregistered managed investments scheme from providing financial services. This followed a successful action last year where the Federal Court made orders regarding the companies, prevented the companies from operating their scheme and permitted the assets of the scheme to be returned to investors. The action by ASIC ensured that $2.8 million was returned to 26 investors - that is, a repayment of all moneys.Last year ASIC secured convictions against 27 people, with jail terms of 97 years; 58 company officers were banned; 12 auditors and liquidators were disciplined or deregistered; 60 companies were wound up; and, 215 criminal civil and administrative proceedings were undertaken. The success of Australia's national corporate regulation depends on a referral of power from state governments. The Commonwealth does not have unqualified power over corporations. The High Court has found that on a number of occasions, and this system can be maintained only if the states refer their residual power over corporations to the Commonwealth government.Mr Speaker, you will recall that on two occasions I have raised the matter in the House that the current referrals are due to expire on 15 July, and I am pleased to report that many of the states have now extended that referral. However, the date for the referral, 15 July, is less than four weeks away. If we do not receive the remaining referrals, Australia's system of corporate regulation will collapse. I regret to inform the House that one government has still not got around to referring this power, and that is the New South Wales government. Again, the New South Wales government has not been able to refer to the Commonwealth its corporations power, which underpins all of the Corporations Law. This is not a matter to be played around with. Recently in the Australian Financial Review, Professor Ian Ramsay was quoted as saying:It's hard to imagine this delay is simply due to tardiness ... I suspect it reflects brinkmanship ...It is brinkmanship coming out of the New South Wales government - the factional controllers of the Leader of the Opposition - in relation to Corporations Law. We had the Investment and Financial Services Association, IFSA, putting out a press release yesterday calling on the states to extend the referral power and saying we are risking:... the regulatory framework and governance underpinning around $1 trillion worth of Australian savings and investments.I call on the Leader of the Opposition to get in touch with the New South Wales government as a matter of urgency and to instruct his union backers and factional allies to give the referral to the Commonwealth - a referral which underpins the whole system of corporate regulation in this country, a referral which is necessary to $1 trillion of investments which are held by average Australians - rather than play brinkmanship. - He interjects in defence of the New South Wales government's tardiness. He interjects in defence of them rather than standing up for once and saying to these factional backers to get on with it - take a position in the interests of financial investors. He interjects in that way in which he attempts to absolve himself from any responsibility. This is an important matter. We call on the New South Wales government to do it. It is necessary for every investor in Australia.</DOC>

 - I think all of us around here know that nobody misleads Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes is a very competent journalist. Let me say to the member for Perth that what I said on Sunday is perfectly true, and that is that under the law - and I am glad he asked me this question, because people have been running around the country around telling porkies about it; they really have. It amazes me - it shocks me, in fact - that people would go around saying that under the law you can bargain away your four weeks annual leave. You cannot do that. - I am telling the member for Perth that my assertion in relation to annual leave is absolutely true. Loadings were the subject of bargaining long before Work Choices. There is nothing revolutionary about that. Let me just remind the member for Perth in case he has forgotten that under the Work Choices law you are guaranteed four weeks annual leave. You cannot give that away. You are allowed at your request - that I think has to be in writing - to cash out up to two weeks of that. And do you know the state of Australia on which that particular provision is modelled? It was modelled on the industrial relations legislation of the Western Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and very strong support for the global fight against terrorism and the support of democracy in Iraq. Yesterday the nationally democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq made an announcement which represents a significant milestone in the move towards democracy in Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki announced that the first province in Iraq which will transfer entirely to provincial Iraqi control will be that of Al Muthanna.The Australian Defence Force currently has some 1,350 of its personnel, of whom we are very proud, across the theatre of Iraq, from the security detachment in Baghdad through to the North Arabian Gulf in one of our Anzac class frigates, conducting surveillance flights with P3C Orions, heavy airlift in C130 Hercules and a variety of other important roles in Baghdad, including security. We have had 460 soldiers protecting some 600 Japanese engineers in the Al Muthanna province. Over that time our soldiers have done us proud. They have trained around 1,650 Iraqi army soldiers of the 2nd Brigade of the National Iraqi Army. They have also supported a number of very important projects. The member for Moore in particular will be interested in the mobile health clinic. There have also been veterinary clinics, water purification, the restoration of a community centre, the refurbishment of bus stations, the development of an ambulance station, the reconnection of electricity and a whole variety of very important tasks.I am advised that very shortly we can expect the Japanese Prime Minister and the Japanese defence minister to announce the future of the Japanese engineers in Al Muthanna. Should the Japanese government announce that it will be withdrawing its engineers then the Australian government will redeploy our 460 soldiers to Tallil, which is an American air base just north of the Al Muthanna-Dhi Qar border. They will there undertake training at the basic training centre and further provide training for the Iraqi security forces. They will also -  - So the government is disposed to having the Australian Defence Force in Al Muthanna provide training from the air base in Tallil. They will also provide further training in support of border protection to the Iraqi security forces in the southern part of Iraq. In addition to that, if the Iraqi security forces, under the direction of the democratically elected Iraqi national government and the provincial government of Al Muthanna, require it, and if the legal, administrative and military arrangements are to the satisfaction of the Australian government, we will provide in extremis support to the Iraqi security forces. This is a very important step and an important milestone in the move to the democratically governed country of Iraq. We are very proud of what our soldiers have done. This job is associated with risk because it is an important job. We are very proud of them and we look forward to further progress in Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. It is very important to Australia and to Australians that stability be brought to the Middle East. It is also extremely important that we appreciate that the war against terrorism is a global activity. It is not confined to our borders or to our region. -  - Terrorist activity in Iraq and in countries in the Middle East has everything to do with Australia and the next generation of Australians. The Labor Party cannot on the one hand celebrate and welcome -  -  - As was foreshadowed some months ago, the progress in Iraq is that, having had a democratically elected Iraqi government, where 12 million Iraqis at risk to their lives voted on three occasions, the process in Iraq is to move to provincial Iraqi control. What that means is that the coalition, working with the Iraqi government, including the provincial government, has been working with the British forces, the Iraqi forces and all of those who are in Iraq to negotiate the arrangements under which the Iraqi people will govern themselves and be responsible for their own security. Of course there has been a detailed intelligence and risk assessment undertaken of this, and the Leader of the Opposition of all people should know that under no circumstances do we discuss intelligence issues in a public arena. - I further say to the opposition: you cannot on the one hand -  -  - The third most senior operative in al-Qaeda, al-Zarqawi, was killed the week before last. That was news that was welcomed by the Leader of the Opposition. You cannot on the one hand argue that the fight against terrorism should not be undertaken in Iraq and then welcome the outcome of the heavy lifting being done by the rest of the world. The Leader of the Opposition is no more than the bloke at the back of the tandem bike who does not -  -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and his interest in workplace relations in Australia. It is true that the government believe that we should have one single national system of industrial relations. We believe that because it would reduce duplication, it would reduce complexity and it would reduce the cost and confusion for both employers and employees. The reality is that we have some 10 million Australians in work in Australia - the highest number historically - but thousands of different state and federal awards and pieces of legislation. There are six competing systems of industrial relations operating, which is costly, confusing and complex. The government are committed to reducing this burden.I was asked by the member for Ryan whether there were any other significant figures who have supported one national system of industrial relations. As far back as 1972 the then Labor Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Whitlam, supported a national system of industrial relations. It was interesting, when I read the Workplace Express email recently, that the member for Perth had told an industrial relations society conference in South Australia just last Friday that it would 'not be inappropriate' for the ALP to contemplate a national system of industrial relations. - I hear the member for Perth interjecting. It was a bit like him running around to the business community in Australia in the last year saying it would not be inappropriate to have AWAs. I take it from that that the member for Perth is advocating that we have a national system and is joining with what the government wants to do. He is not the only one who would see a national system as being valid. Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, said last March:We are not necessarily in principle hostile to having a more cogent and clear national system of industrial relations. I think the economic efficiency argument is quite clear.That is what we on this side of the chamber have been saying month after month. If we can remove this duplication and cost, it will be of great benefit in productivity to businesses in Australia and therefore indirectly to the workers of Australia as well. We know that the architect of the Leader of the Opposition's backflip on AWAs, Mr Robertson, the Secretary of Unions NSW, is implacably opposed to a national system of industrial relations in Australia. The question out there is this: who is going to write part of the ALP's policy on industrial relations? Is it going to be the member for Perth, who was rolled on the last part of their policy, or is it going to be Mr Robertson, the leader as I understand it of the 'gang of mobsters' - the 'mob of gangsters' - in Sydney? Is it going to be the shadow spokesman for industrial relations or is he going to get rolled once again by the union bosses?</DOC>

It is interesting, even ironic, that the member for Werriwa should be asking this question today, because the coalition party room has had quite an extensive debate on the independent contractors legislation. In fact, great care has been taken in the preparation of that legislation to look after the goodwill of the very people you ask the question on behalf of.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. I acknowledge his long-term passionate advocacy in this area and his advocacy on behalf of the Mental Illness Fellowship North Queensland and, in particular, its members working in his area. As the Prime Minister announced earlier this year and as was confirmed in the budget, this government will spend an additional $1.9 billion to boost mental health services over the next five years. This includes, amongst other things, about $800 million for psychologists consultations and mental health nurse services that should benefit up to 71,000 patients a year. The details are still being worked out in consultation with the relevant professional bodies, but the delivery will resemble current referred and 'for and on behalf of' services and services currently provided under the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program - which I should inform the House will be retained and expanded. I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing for the good work he has done in developing this important package of measures.The government is also spending $130 million to train an additional 400 mental health nurses and an additional 120 clinical psychologists a year. There will be $370 million to help mental health patients to gain work and also to provide 650 new respite places for the families of mental health patients.I think this demonstrates that the Howard government has certainly lived up to its responsibilities in this area. I can inform the House that so far the New South Wales government has committed an additional $420 million, the Victorian government $170 million, and the Western Australian government $47 million to improving mental health services. We would like to see some additional commitment from those governments but we would like to see some commitment to start with from the Queensland, the South Australian and the Tasmanian governments. I think, given what the federal government has done, the Australian people have a right to expect commensurate commitment from each of the states.</DOC>

 - I did see the report and I am informed that these allegations are being investigated jointly by the department of immigration and the relevant state and federal agencies. On 16 June this year, the department's officials in Guangzhou met with representatives of the Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation company to discuss the allegations. On 20 June, the department and the Office of Workplace Services will visit ABC Tissue to make further inquiries. On 23 June, the department will meet the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union to discuss further the issues they have raised. Occupational health and safety concerns have been referred to WorkCover New South Wales. The department takes, so I am informed, all allegations of exploitation of workers and the inappropriate use of the temporary skilled migration program very seriously. All allegations are fully investigated and, where they are proven, appropriate sanctions are applied. In other words, there has been a full, prompt and, I believe, to date, unarguably an effective investigation in relation to these allegations.There was some suggestion in the article and perhaps in some commentary that there had been some approach by way of representations by the Attorney-General to the minister to intervene. Let me say at no time did the Attorney-General make representations or discuss this case with the minister or the department of immigration. In no way did he try to influence the process. In other words, the allegations are being taken seriously and obviously the outcome of that investigation will be made known. If something wrong has happened, sanctions will be applied. If something wrong has not happened, then no sanctions should be applied. What fairer, more transparent, more decent system could you possibly have?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. We know that the honourable member for Deakin has a very genuine and ongoing concern about the plight of the world's refugees. Today being World Refugee Day it is appropriate to acknowledge that 8½ million refugees in the world today are living in some of the most appalling circumstances. What pleases me is that the figure has significantly declined and is at its lowest level since the early 1980s.If you look to see why that is the case, you find it is because many have been able to return home; that in many places there has been effective local integration; and that some countries, such as Australia, play a part in resettling those who have no prospect of returning home and are in the most difficult of circumstances. It can also be attributed to Australian policies - the decisive action taken by governments to ensure that the most despicable regimes, of the sort that we have seen in Afghanistan and Iraq, have been removed. Such circumstances have meant that fewer people have had to flee.Australia continues to punch above its weight in resettling refugees and is consistently among the top three countries, along with the United States and Canada. This year some 13,800 refugee and humanitarian places will be offered. That is almost double the number that were being resettled from offshore in 1999-2000.One of the reasons that we are able to do this is that offshore detention, which has been referred to by members opposite, as part of our border protection measures has been able to work and has worked. The government's record shows that we have been able to give genuine refugees assistance and, in appropriate cases, resettlement, but we have also been able to give more support to the refugees who are in greatest need. It is in that context that we on this side of the House have a very longstanding commitment to helping refugees.I would contrast it, as I have been asked by members opposite, with the approach that they seem to want to take to these issues today. Contrary to the position that the Leader of the Opposition was advocating back in 2001, when a bipartisan approach was sought, the Labor Party want to play politics with this issue now. That is what they are about. -  - I have the courage to support policies and programs that work and support the most vulnerable. We are not about to chop and change in the way that members opposite have and to walk away from policies that have been shown to work effectively and in Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. He was celebrating with a lot of us last night in the Great Hall because one of his constituents, Mr Warren Suradi, was a finalist in the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole Achievement Awards. As one of the great participants - an outstanding participant - Mr Suradi had been involved with a team of fellow work-for-the-dolees in building greenhouses and a market garden in an Indigenous community in the Northern Territory. We strongly commend all of last night's finalists and particularly Mr Suradi.Work for the Dole is now nine years old and it is an extraordinary program. It began with some controversy. Some felt that it was not appropriate that the long-term unemployed were asked to work in their communities to meet a mutual obligation and, therefore, to have a sense of greater contribution, given that they were being supported by that same community. We have statistics now which show that some 80 per cent of people who complete a Work for the Dole program say that it has improved their self-esteem and improved their capacity to find a job and, indeed, their sense of wanting to go back and find work. In fact, over 42 per cent of those who finish a Work for the Dole program within three months are in a job or are doing work related training. However, it is not just the individual who has had such an extraordinary benefit through Work for the Dole. There have been nearly half a million Work for the Dole participants in these last nine years. No doubt these half a million who have moved on to work as a result of the program have helped bring down the unemployment statistics in Australia to some of the lowest rates in 30 years.We know, for example, that the 29,000 projects that these Work for the Dole teams have worked on in communities right across Australia - from metropolitan areas to rural areas - have helped build community. They have given back where someone could not have been employed on a salary. It was not work that was in any way supplanting a paid workforce; it was work that built back - for example, gardens and toys for preschools. There has been a lot of natural resource development work and cultural and heritage protection. Just one project, for example - the Work for the Dole team in Ulverstone, Tasmania - has built a safe area for dementia sufferers in the Mount St Vincent Nursing Home. In Shoalhaven, the member for Gilmore's area, the Scrap Shop at Bomaderry has recycled materials and, while the Work for the Dole trainees or participants have been doing this work, they have also been training in retail and business through a TAFE course.Let me tell you that, after nine years, the Work for the Dole program has proved itself to be among the most outstanding in our suite of programs that help Australia's unemployed; it has helped to bring down our unemployment statistics to their lowest level in 30 years. I thank all of the members of the opposition who attended the Prime Minister's awards last night in the Great Hall, celebrating the outstanding work of our Work for the Dole participants, the CWCs and the sponsors. In this day and age, we should commend the courage of our long-term unemployed who are getting a better life through participating in community work that is meaningful for them and meaningful for their families and the places they come from.</DOC>

 - Could I say the reason why: in the 32 years I have been in this place, I have not, like many other members, made a habit of altering in any way the Hansard record of things I have said, so I want that withdrawn. -  -  -  - I did not alter Hansard. -  - I did not alter Hansard, and the Leader of the Opposition is so fond of throwing allegations around. I would like the Leader of the Opposition to have the courage to demonstrate in a proper forensic way what happened. I would like him to do it. -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition asked me a long question which included an inaccurate claim that I had altered Hansard. If he is referring to the fact that, through a slip of the tongue, I said 'Labor' rather than 'Liberal', I can assure him the correction was not made at my request or instigation. It was made automatically by the Hansard staff. I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that he has wasted 10 minutes of question time making a phoney allegation like that. It is of a piece with the absurd, over-the-top claim he made that in some way the government is behaving in an evil fashion in order to have the committee system that operated for 12 of the 13 years that the Labor Party was in office. Because we are bringing that back, we are somehow or other overturning parliamentary democracy. This is a bit rich coming from a man who served as Deputy Prime Minister to Lord Keating when he was Prime Minister, who basically looked across the dispatch box, looked at the serfs on the other side and said, 'Question time is a privilege extended by the executive to the parliament.'If the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten, let me remind him that in a very interesting interview back in 1994 -  -  - Yes, I have a very long memory, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition. I remember this interview very well because I took part in it with the Leader of the Opposition. - The indomitable John Shovelan asked a very searching question on the PM program. He said, 'Mr Beazley, why is it that the government thinks it is unnecessary for the Prime Minister to turn up each day? Why is it that we need to cut his requirement at question time?' Mr Beazley said in response, 'Well, there are very few governments who think it is necessary for the Prime Minister to turn up every day.' Such arrogance. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that, for so long as I am Prime Minister of this country, I will turn up every day, I will make myself accountable and I will go on answering double the number of questions of any of my predecessors, let alone Labor predecessors. This is the most accountable executive since Federation.</DOC>

 - If I can be a little more forensic, let me remind the House that over the last 10 years real wages in Australia have risen by 16.8 per cent. This compares to the 1.3 per cent growth in the 13 years of the previous Labor government. Using the national accounts statistics, a calculation can be made that the average Australian worker is $127 a week better off as a result of the 10 years of this government. They are $127 a week better off after 10½ years of this government than they would have been compared with the economic performance of the former government because, if the real wage pattern of the previous 13 years had continued over the last 10 years, the average Australian worker would have been $127 a week worse off than they have been. That means that the Australian worker is $6,655 a year better off than they would have been under a Labor government. This is not an illusion; this is real money. This is the real dividend and fruits of this government's economic management. I am asked about threats posed to this prosperity. It gives a great deal of relevance to the warnings of the Business Council yesterday and it was all summed up extremely well in the Melbourne Herald Sun today by that eminent and respected economic commentator Terry McCrann when he had this to say:The resources industry is the goose that lays Australia's golden egg. Kim Beazley is prepared to slaughter it - mindlessly, cynically -  - He said:... and almost casually irresponsibly. Let there be absolutely no mistake. If Labor won the next election and if it delivered on its promise to abolish Australian Workplace Agreements, it would seriously hurt every single current and future Australian ... AWAs are the fundamental basis of that flexibility and productivity. Abolish them and you rip away the foundation of the resources industry's success.The member for Tangney asked me about threats. Terry McCrann has nailed the nature, the extent and the dimension of the threat posed by a Beazley Labor government.</DOC>

 - I quite like Laurie, but let me say his analysis is not one that I would accept. Let me put it graciously: his analysis is not one that I am minded to accept. But I am in a benevolent mood and I do not want to be too harsh about an esteemed correspondent, particularly as I am attending that press gallery bash tonight - although, Mr Speaker, I will have to be very careful of how I behave. Seriously, this is an issue relating to credibility and credibility is about performance and is about delivery. If you want to compare the wage credibility and performance of this government with the former Labor government, I am very happy to engage in the analysis.The other observation I would make is that I have an enormous amount of respect for Cardinal Pell, as I have said before. I do not always agree with him; he does not always agree with me. I think we have well-documented differences of view about whether or not Australia should become a republic, but I do have an enormous regard for the leadership that he brings to the 27 per cent of Australians who claim the Catholic faith. I think he is one of the most impressive ecclesiastical figures in Australia, but I would also invite the member for Perth to have a look at the rest of Cardinal Pell's statement. He has some very interesting observations about workplace agreements and you ought to read them.</DOC>

 - I regret to say to the member for Hume that my attention has been drawn. I think it is an outrage that the parents of children attending government schools all around Australia are not getting the full value of the $1 zillion Investing in Our Schools program in government schools and low-fee independent schools that I announced at the time of the 2004 election. We have done this because the states have not invested enough in government schools. We have done this because the rate of increase of state government investment in government schools has been slower than the rate of increase of federal government investment. I think it is outrageous that, as you move around the country, you can find countless examples. There is an example in Western Australia where figures of up to 16 per cent are being deducted. An example was quoted in the Sunday Telegraph, drawn to my attention by the member for Hume who asked the question, of the Iemma government deducting about $600,000 from about 30 schools. These are basic provisions that we are making. We are filling the space that should have been occupied by the state governments and they have got the nerve and the effrontery to charge the schools for administering our program. Our program was intended to help the schools. I call on the state governments to stop docking from Australian parents the money that we are providing because they have not done their job.</DOC>

Thirty of our soldiers will be involved in providing further training at the basic training centre in Tallil. Another three will be supporting education at the counterinsurgency unit, which is some 20 kilometres from Baghdad. The training and mentoring that they will be undertaking will be not only for the general support and training of the Iraqi security forces in Al Muthanna but also for border protection and support and training for those who will be undertaking border protection not only on the Saudi border but also on the Syrian border.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Of course, representing that part of Queensland that he does, he understands the importance of export industries such as the Australian coal industry. We have seen some incredible growth in resources exports in recent years. In fact, the coal exports grew from 2004 to 2005 from $13 billion to $22 billion - a lot of those being exported out of the ports in the member for Hinkler's electorate. So our export industries are very reliant on the infrastructure available, not just the transport infrastructure such as the ports - we all remember the debacle in Dalrymple Bay last year holding up the flow of exports and particularly coal exports going out of Queensland - but also the social infrastructure that is largely the responsibility of the state governments in Australia to maintain, provide and support.To this end, we do not believe that some of the state governments have the same focus on the importance of exports, industries, employment and safety in regional Australia as the Commonwealth government does. To give an example: last year BHP's Blackwater coal mine in Central Queensland was compromised by the Queensland Labor government's chronic underfunding of public hospitals and health services in Queensland. When the Queensland Health doctor at the Blackwater Hospital was away on sick leave, the Queensland government refused to replace him. They refused to provide a locum at that hospital to service that part of Queensland. In that area, BHP operate the Blackwater mine and, to their credit, BHP had a helicopter on stand-by in Emerald to fly a doctor into Blackwater if needed because the Queensland Labor government would not replace the doctor at Blackwater Hospital. Because of the Queensland Labor government's failure to deliver reasonable health services in regional Queensland, the Blackwater mine operation was interrupted by an unlawful industrial action. It was aimed at the Beattie government because they would not replace the doctor at Blackwater when he was off sick.Australia's export industry should not be put at risk and Australia's exports should not be interrupted because state Labor governments like that in Queensland - who participate in receiving $42 billion during the course of the health care agreements to help pay for public hospital services - do not live up to their responsibilities. Not only that but also Queensland this year are in receipt of an extra $525 million in GST receipts. So they are $525 million better off. They get money for their public hospitals through the Australian health care agreements, yet they still do not deliver the services where they are needed and they are interrupting the ability of Australian companies to export out of Australia. The states have to get serious about supporting Australian exports and they have to get serious about providing a decent level of services to regional Australia.</DOC>

 - The government is not acting in any way to appease Indonesia. As evidence of that, I do intend when I next see the Indonesian President - notwithstanding the advice tendered by the gentleman quoted by the member who asked me the question - to raise the question of Abu Bakar Bashir and I do intend to put to the Indonesian President the strongly held views of the Australian people regarding this issue.So far as the legislation to which the member refers is concerned, this government remains quite firm in its resolve to, where opportunity presents, further strengthen our border protection. Unlike the Labor Party, we have a strong, unequivocal position on protecting this country's borders. Unlike the Labor Party, we have a very strong and determined position in relation to deterring illegal immigration. If the honourable gentleman is candid enough about the research that I am sure he has done on this issue, he will know that back in 2001 there was no more frequent advocate of the need to cooperate with Indonesia than the current Leader of the Opposition. In fact, on one occasion the Leader of the Opposition effectively said, 'Oh, you can fix all this border protection stuff by ringing up the Indonesian President and having a chat about it.' - In other words -  - the sine qua non of everything he said on this issue was that you have to get along well with Indonesia. It is an element. It is not the only element. I would remind the member for Watson that, in contrast to those very difficult months of 2001 when there was a veritable flood of illegal immigrants coming to this country, the reason that has stopped is essentially a combination of three or four things. It is first and foremost the policy that we resolved upon in 2001 of intercepting and returning boats to Indonesia. That could not have been achieved without the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities in receiving the vessels back. The second element was the introduction of the Pacific solution, which the Labor Party has pledged to abolish. Let it be remembered that the Labor Party will abolish the Pacific solution, yet that played an enormous part in bringing about the turnaround and the change. The decision in relation to processing people offshore has been fundamental to deterring people from coming to Australia, to cooperation with the Indonesian security and police authorities and - might I say - to the excellent work carried out by the Australian defence forces and the Australian Customs Service. All of these things together have stopped the flow of boat people. It is only the coalition parties that had the courage then and have had the consistency since to maintain that policy. If you want a return to those bad and difficult days, vote for the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that small business employs about 3.3 million Australians and is absolutely critical to the success of the Australian economy. In fact, in the last 10 years there has been a 12 per cent increase in the number of small businesses in this country. In the recent budget, the government announced a number of measures to assist small business further. One was increasing the assets test so that small business could get the advantage of capital gains tax rollover. They could get the 15-year exemption on capital gains tax and the retirement exemption. Another measure was cutting the incorporation fee from $800 to $400, at an estimated cost of $216 million over the next four years, to help small business with incorporation fees.One of the major improvements for small business which this government announced in the budget was an improvement in the depreciation arrangements by increasing the diminishing value rate for depreciation from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. Let me give the House some examples of what this will do for small business. For a business acquiring a new truck worth $230,000, this budget announcement alone would give a benefit of $15,333 in the first year of ownership. In other words, the write-off, by increasing the diminishing value, would be of direct benefit to that small business. For a farmer acquiring a tractor worth $90,000, the change in the depreciation - the diminishing value depreciation rate - will give a benefit of $6,750 in the first year of ownership. These are very strong incentives for investment in new plant and equipment and they are real benefits.I was thinking of these real benefits to small business as I was sitting in my Canberra flat last night, cold and alone. -  - Alone, yes; feeling unloved, yes; and watching Lateline, as I do, to cheer myself up. I saw the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations talking about the advantages to employees of $338 a week, if they were able to get a job in the retail sector. He held up the $338. It woke me up, Mr Speaker. He is a man of great financial acumen. I waited for the response from the Australian Labor Party. We had the member for Perth, who said:... let me just respond, first of all, by making this point. My 2c trumps his Liberal Party fistful of dollars every day of the week because it's illusory.The $338 is illusory! And that took my mind back -  - to another payment of $600, of which when it was given to the families of Australia the Labor Party said - remember - that it wasn't real, it didn't exist. This is known as 'rooster logic'. It started off with the member for Lilley, spreading like some kind of bird flu to the member for Perth. One of the symptoms of 'bird flu' is that you have delusional fits - speaking of which - Government members - No! - These are real benefits - real benefits for real people. They are real benefits on depreciation, they are real benefits on family tax benefits and they are real benefits in their wages. No amount of rooster logic will take away from the fact that this is real money, real benefits, to Australian people and they are delivered by the coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and for his interest in creating jobs in Australia. Australia now has a workplace relations system which recognises that employers and employees want to work out the wages and conditions which best suit their needs -  - rather than having them imposed upon them by remote industrial tribunals and third parties. Indeed the best workplace arrangements are those which are developed and agreed to by employers and employees alike. Australian workplace agreements, which the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite want to abolish, are an essential part of that workplace relations system and they deliver significant benefits. On average, Australian workplace agreements deliver benefits that are 13 per cent more than those on collective agreements, and very significantly they deliver 100 per cent more than those on -  - I was saying to the chamber that AWAs deliver substantial benefits - 13 per cent more, on average, than those on collective agreements and 100 per cent more than those on awards. We have had the Labor Party and their union bosses running around Australia, seeking to highlight instances where, they claim, people are losing benefits as a result of Work Choices. - We had the member for Perth come into this chamber and claim that workers at Esselte would be worse off because of a proposed AWA, because they would lose Saturday penalty rates. The only problem with this claim is that Esselte does not actually roster workers to work on Saturday. - If workers do on occasions work on a Saturday voluntarily, they are paid overtime rates. - If the member for Perth does not understand even this basic point, it is no wonder that some of the union bosses want him stripped of his shadow portfolio. - Before coming into this place and making these claims, did the member for Perth bother to check the facts for himself? No. He simply relied upon the biased and inaccurate information provided to him by the unions. We had another example last week when the Leader of the Opposition came into this place and asked the Prime Minister why a Melbourne grandmother had been sacked with no recourse. The problem is that, at the very time the Leader of the Opposition came in here to ask this question, the union representing the lady in question had already said that it was commencing unlawful termination action on her behalf.The Leader of the Opposition must have known that yet he chose, as the member for Perth chose, to misrepresent the facts of this case. So what we see here once again is Labor's pattern of deceit. That is what we are seeing here. The Leader of the Opposition cannot understand that these policies are about creating jobs for Australians. He would not have a sense of that because when he was responsible for employment in this country we had over a million people on dole queues; we had an unemployment rate of 10.9 per cent. The sad reality for the opposition is that the Leader of the Opposition is interested in only one job: his own. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. He will probably have heard that a group of south-east Queensland mayors are proposing to come to Canberra to complain that the Australian government is not contributing enough for infrastructure works in south-east Queensland towards the state government's south-east regional plan. Putting aside whether or not the Commonwealth government should be paying for a state government plan, most of it probably would not be necessary if the state government had not neglected infrastructure in south-east Queensland over recent decades. They have not yet got over their period of neglect. In fact, in last year's Queensland budget they put in $296 million for transport infrastructure but in fact spent only $164 million - a 33 per cent underexpenditure and yet they are asking the Commonwealth for more money.The mayors were particularly concerned about having some additional funding for the Ipswich Motorway. But of course we have committed $556 million for the Ipswich Motorway; $160 million for the Logan Motorway junction - that money has been available to the state for at least a year but they have not got on to spending it yet - $320 million for widening the Wakool to Darra section; $66 million for the Granad road intersection; and $10 million to do the work for the northern section between Dinmore and Goodna, being the planning work so that we can get on with those projects. They also asked us for some money for around Caboolture. There is $200 million being spent around Caboolture, and I am sure the honourable member for Longman and others would be very pleased to see the progress that is being made there. They wanted money for the Pacific Highway. There is $120 million in the budget for our commitment to the Tugun bypass. We have paid off the $163 million commitment to the Pacific Highway two years early, and of course there is a whole range of other projects which we are funding as well. So when the state government has spent the money that we have already allocated, that will be the time to come and ask for some more.The mayors would also like some money for the Bruce Highway. The honourable member for Fairfax and I would like to see some money spent on the Bruce Highway as well but, as I have reported to the House previously, we cannot spend any money on the Bruce Highway because the Beattie government are intent on flooding it. They are determined to go ahead with the Traveston Dam, which will flood at least nine kilometres of the Bruce Highway, plus all of the favoured options for upgrading. Beattie is still determined, it seems, to build this dam. He was actually quoted as saying the other day that he will build the dam no matter what. The fact that he has not done any environmental, engineering, social or feasibility studies is beside the point; he is going to build it and he is going to build it in spite of the fact that the University of Queensland has told him that half of the water will evaporate or leak away because the dam is being built in country which is not suitable for a dam.Indeed the minister has now admitted that, from their drilling, the wall cannot be built on the site which the Queensland government has located for this dam. In addition to that, they have also had to admit that this dam was only rated fifth on the list of priorities for the preferred site for a dam for south-east Queensland. It was rated fifth but it was elevated above everything else. In spite of all the evidence, Premier Beattie is going to build it. Despite the fact that it is going to flood 900 farms and it will require a bund to be built around the town of Kandanga so that the town does not go under water, despite the fact that the cost has blown out to $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion, it is still going to be built and the road is going to be flooded irrespective of what the sense might be. I think that if the south-east Queensland mayors want some road funding for the Bruce Highway, the first thing they had better do is persuade Premier Beattie to stop flooding the road so we can get on with building it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and a very deep interest in and commitment to defence issues. The defence capability plan refers to the long-term strategic commitment that the government makes to investment in Australian defence infrastructure. Yesterday, on behalf of the government, I released the defence capability plan for the decade from 2006 until 2016. It contains $51 billion in fully costed defence projects and, in addition to that, $31 billion in projects to be funded over the next 10 years.It includes, for example, the government's restated long-term financial commitment to the construction of three air warfare destroyers in Adelaide, South Australia, at a cost of $6 billion and, in addition to that, two LHDs, or amphibious ships, at a cost of $2 billion. The government has restated its commitment to the new air combat capability arrangements, at some $15 billion, and in addition to that, amongst many projects, the government will be replacing all of its Army land vehicles at a cost of around $2½ billion.It is important to note that in our naval commitment, for example, there is more than half a billion dollars of new projects to improve the effectiveness of our naval air-surface capability. On Monday morning, the Prime Minister, amongst these projects, announced on behalf of the government - at a cost of $4.2 billion in total - that the Black Hawk helicopters will be replaced, as will the Sea King helicopters at Nowra, with the multirole helicopter, the MRH90.Those investments are not just in the helicopters but are for the average Australian. People in Townsville, for example, will see another $30 million invested in infrastructure to support the 24 helicopters that will go there. The people of Gilmore will see a $40 million investment in Nowra to accommodate six MRH90s; at Oakey there will be a $30 million investment. Also, as the member for Hughes knows, we are investing $100 million in fully restructuring the Holsworthy facility to take 12 MRH90s. What is extremely important is that Australians recognise that the Howard government has made a very strong political commitment to the defence of this country and that, thanks to its leadership in economic management, has significant resources available to invest in the protection, security and defence of our country for the next decade and beyond.</DOC>

 - I certainly do thank the member for Bass for his question. I acknowledge that he has been long concerned about these issues, particularly the issue of youth suicide from his days as a schoolteacher in the Tasmanian system. We have had a landmark report released today by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and it confirms the joint view of the premiers of the Labor states and the Prime Minister that Australia's health system is amongst the best in the world. Certainly it is not flawless - the government is working with the states to address the problem of Indigenous ill health and the obesity epidemic - but it is a very good system by international standards.I can report that at just over 80 years, Australians' life expectancy is among the top five countries in the world. Cancer death rates have declined by 14 per cent since 1986; deaths from strokes have declined by 30 per cent since 1995; coronary heart disease deaths have declined by 40 per cent since 1995; and infant death rates have declined by almost 50 per cent since 1983. Importantly, for the member for Bass, the youth suicide rate has almost halved since it peaked in the mid-1990s, and suicide rates generally are at their lowest rate since records were first kept in 1907.These good results did not happen by accident; they happened in part because this government has invested the money needed to make a good system even better. I think this government, on these figures, is entitled to say that it is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. By contrast, since 3 May, the Australian Labor Party has officially been a policy free zone when it comes to health. I looked at the website today and the nearest thing to a hard policy on health that I could find was a commitment to spend $5 million on food allergy research. That was the nearest thing to a hard policy I could find. I can tell the members opposite that this government spends more than that already through the National Health and Medical Research Council. Mr Speaker, let me just say this: if you have no policy on health, you have no hope of ever forming a government in this country.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I can claim it for a number of reasons. I can claim it first and foremost because, demonstrably, we do have a skills shortage at the present time. Clearly, with the economy in many parts of the nation running at or near full capacity, with an absolutely voracious demand for skilled tradesmen in areas such as the resource sector, there is overwhelmingly a need to have a policy that allows skilled tradesmen to come into this country on appropriate terms and conditions.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot seriously argue that, if you have a skills shortage - which she has been running around the country saying that we have; and I agree with her on that - and you have in many parts of the country effectively full employment, it stands to reason that you have to close the gap in the short term until you can bring more tradesmen on stream from the local area by bringing in people from overseas. It is elementary that you would have to do that. I might remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, in many cases around Australia, the certifying authorities for the people who get the visas are state Labor governments, and they are amongst the most passionate advocates of this system.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted four companies, one of them Teys Bros. She has been demonstrated to have misled this House in relation to Teys Bros. So, in those circumstances, I do not think her argument carries any weight at all. We need to have a balance in this country, certainly in the short term, between bringing in people from overseas with the requisite skills and bringing on more skilled trades men and women in Australia. This government has struck the balance. Where there are abuses, we will investigate. Where there are breaches, we will sanction them. But we do not intend to throw out a system that is clearly meeting an urgent need and is important to the continuing growth and development of Australian industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. The fact is that this government has demonstrated a very strong commitment to protecting Australia's national security. The government has funded over 200 national security related measures at a total cost of more than $8 billion over 10 years. Our national security agency, ASIO, is being well resourced. Currently, there is a recruitment campaign which is attracting, as I think we have seen in some reporting today, the best and the brightest. While it is not appropriate to go into detail, some of these measures have resulted in successful prosecutions for terrorist related offences. The government has been taking firm measures because we are concerned about the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Bali bombings, in which Australians lost their lives and the London and Spain train attacks, where thousands of people have lost their lives over time. But it appears that there are other views.The member for Fremantle, who is the senior vice-president of the national executive of the ALP, has written a new book. It is always interesting to look at her views. The member for Fremantle in a radio interview - I think yesterday - suggested that our concerns about terrorism are bordering on the irrational. She went on to suggest that security measures such as we have here are almost frivolous. She feels that we have overreacted to attacks such as September 11, the Bali bombings and the attacks on London and Spain. Why? Because more people are killed in road accidents. Her logic seems to be that, where attacks are deliberate and on our way of life and might be able to be dealt with, they are the same as road accidents, where there is often no deliberate intent of taking innocent lives. Yet we pay considerable attention to those matters. We run prominent campaigns on road safety and we have legislated for vehicle safety. Perhaps she says those matters are an overreaction or perhaps an invasion of civil liberties.But I am pleased about the very high level of cooperation that we have between the Commonwealth and the states of Australia. Quite clearly, Labor premiers do not support her views. They have welcomed and embraced the antiterrorism laws that we have. I want to assure the House that this government will protect the community. We will take appropriate action to prevent terrorists achieving their role in Australia. And the Leader of the Opposition should be concerned that the member for Fremantle, a member of his own executive, appears to have given up the fight against terrorism, something which this government has not.</DOC>

The honourable member will appreciate the complexity of the issues surrounding the introduction of a code and the need to avoid unforeseen consequences to the detriment of growers and others throughout the whole of the supply chain.

 - I thank the member for Casey for his interest in defence and defence industries. It is timely, as many of the nation's defence industry representatives are here in Canberra today for the 14th annual Defence + Industry Conference. As the Minister for Defence has outlined, the government has a defence capability plan, but a key support of that is the capability of our defence industries.Last Friday was a special occasion. The last frigate built by Tenix at its iconic Williamstown shipyard was delivered on time, on budget as part of a 17-year fixed-price contract worth over $7 billion. It is important to recognise the quality of that work and it shows the capability within our defence industries. The ships are of outstanding quality. In fact, the Chief of Navy said it is the finest ship he has ever taken receipt of. It is a credit to Tenix, its workforce, the expertise of its subcontractors, the dedication of the Anzac system project office and the collaboration between the Royal Australian Navy and the Defence Materiel Organisation.I sense there is an interest for metrics and numbers in the House, so I will provide a few. This project has benefited two economies - that is, Australia and New Zealand. On both sides of the Tasman there have been 1,300 companies involved, with 73 per cent of local content, producing about 8,000 jobs. I am sure the House would be interested to know that the Perth is 3,600 tonnes of ship with a top speed of more than 27 knots and a range of about 6,000 nautical miles. It is very highly equipped and it has already proven itself to be of considerable value to the nation, with an effective contribution in the Persian Gulf and off the north coast of Australia.Some of those in the House would be aware that the ship was tested in the Middle East as part of the Navy's contribution to the Gulf War. It was off the Al Faw Peninsula, and the Anzac was identified as the ideal ship to support the commando assault on that peninsula. The passage to the fire support area was shallow, most likely mined, yet the Anzac made it through safely. It was the first of several ships called upon to fire, with the target being a major Iraqi military installation. For the first time since the Vietnam War, our Navy provided combat gun support. Those 45 rounds of five-inch shells, otherwise known as bricks, were precisely delivered and it is thought to be one of the most effective operations of its kind for accuracy and support in naval history. I commend the project to the House, congratulate Tenix and its workforce and recognise that the Anzac ships continue to evolve and have their capability increased. To the Perth and all those who sail on her, we wish you fair seas and a following wind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. There are two issues inherent in the question. The first relates to the Glock nine-millimetre pistol. As former Chief of Defence Major General Cosgrove remarked, I think on Monday, whilst the design of the pistol is aged, the pistol itself may not be. All of the equipment issues in the Australian Defence Force are under constant supervision by the Defence Force and its military. The second issue is the system which delivers equipment to our soldiers. Shortly after my appointment to the portfolio I initiated an independent inquiry into the System Program Office, which delivers supplies to our Australian soldiers. That office has 33,000 line items and more than $22 million a year in budget. I have received that report. I have had a preliminary meeting with the secretary, the defence chiefs and the chief executive of the Defence Materiel Organisation in relation to it. It is currently being considered by me and the ADF. The outcome of the report and what I intend to do about it will be released in due course.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. The good news is that from 1 July all Australians will have their tax cut. This follows on from the government's tax cuts in five of the last six budgets. The government cut tax in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. From 1 July we will be lifting the low-income tax offsets so that you will not pay tax until you reach $10,000 if you are a low-income earner. We will be increasing thresholds so you will stay on the 15 per cent rate to $25,000. We will be cutting the top rates - the 47c rate to 45c and the 42c rate to 40c - and, as a consequence of that, we will be giving much more incentive.One of the ways in which you can assess the effect of policy is by looking at real disposable income, which is wages and allowances less tax. Let me give the House an example - a single-income family with two children. In 1996 their real disposable income was $38,171. In 2006 it is estimated that their real disposable income will be $52,024, a 36.3 per cent increase. That is because wages have gone up, taxes have come down and family benefits have improved. The government first reduced the family taper from 50 per cent to 30 per cent, and then we reduced it further. We lifted the threshold for the maximum rate of family tax benefit in 2005 to $37,500 and in this budget to $40,000.The other great improvement to the family tax benefit system was the $600 lump sum payment per child per annum. There were some people who claimed that was not real money. As I was sitting in my cold Canberra flat last night, alone, it was too late for Lateline, so I turned to my favourite reading matter - The Latham Diaries. The Latham Diaries told us:The night before the policy release, I - this is Mr Latham - asked Swan - that is the member for Lilley -  - I was never as obsessed with Mark Latham as the roosters were. When Mr Latham asked Mr Swan how to deal with the $600 annual payment, Mr Swan replied:'Just say that it's not real money ...Mr Speaker, $600 per child per annum, which is being received by millions of Australians, and we had the member for Lilley saying, 'It's not real money.' I prefer the observations made about this by Ms Gillard, the Manager of Opposition Business. She told the Age on 1 November 2004:In some of our traditional booths we saw swings against us ...  I think probably the $600 played a role in that. I think we've got to be frank and say there were a lot of people who received $1,200 or $1,800 ... in a lump sum and they were pretty keen to keep it, and they identified needing to vote for the Howard Government as the way of keeping it.They sure did. It was real money. Single-income families, dual-income families and families with children are a lot better off as a consequence of the family policy, the tax policy and the wages policy of this government. The next instalment is on 1 July, and the only way to keep that is to keep a coalition government managing the economy in the interests of average wage earners in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question, and I take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Indi on her recent marriage. The Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations that are fast reaching conclusion are very important for all Australian exporters, but particularly a number of exporters in the electorate of Indi. Australia has been pursuing improvement in this area ever since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.In the electorate of Indi, the beef producers, the sheepmeat producers, the fat lamb producers, the dairy producers and the wine producers all stand to benefit from a successful outcome to this round. We are determined to deliver the benefits of a successful outcome. For example: the Indi beef producers face tariffs of 38 per cent into Japan and 146 per cent into Europe, and we want to get those down; the Indi dairy producers face tariffs of 246 per cent into Europe, and we want to get those down; the Indi fat lamb producers face tariffs of 92 per cent into Europe, and we want to get those down; and, of course, the Indi wine producers face tariffs of around 25 per cent into the Japanese market, and they would like to get more product into the Japanese market.So, across the board, multilateral trade negotiations can deliver a very wide range of benefits to many industries within the Australian economy, and particularly in the electorate of Indi. The objective, particularly for those agricultural industries, is that we see the EU make greater commitments to open its markets to agricultural products. We need to see the United States reduce the subsidies it pays its farmers. We need to see the developing countries lower their tariffs on industrial products in order to open up trade across the world. If we are successful with these improvements, the extra access gained could boost agricultural exports from Indi by about 15 per cent.Just recently an OECD report was released that indicated that Australia had the second lowest level of agricultural support in the OECD. The challenge now confronting the rest of those OECD countries in these negotiations is to match what Australia has already done.</DOC>

 - In answer to the last part of the question, the bill will be debated, being the intention of the government, when we return in six weeks time. In relation to the other matters, self-evidently - and I think he is asking for a legal opinion so I will chance my arm; I have been out of practice for about 30 years but I will have a go -  - Don't remind me of that. I will have a go. Self-evidently, the laws of Australia have application except in those limited cases where some degree of extraterritoriality has been accepted by private international law. The laws of Australia only apply to Australia and the territories under the control of Australia. But it is the case, for example, so I am advised, that the actions of Commonwealth officials in other places can remain within the purview of somebody, for example, such as the Ombudsman. I might, on that basis of giving legal opinions, quit while I am in front.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I would like to say to the students from the Corpus Christi school that they have an outstanding member in the member for Lindsay, one who, I might say, has taken a great deal of interest in family law and related issues. On that basis, I can certainly say to her constituents and prospective constituents that she made a significant contribution to one of the hallmark reports of this parliament, Every picture tells a story, which was the genesis of the family law reforms about which I have been asked. I was able to launch for her in her electorate the proposed family relationship centre last year and of course I commend her involvement in the task force that has been assisting in the development of these initiatives.Next month will herald a new era for Australian families in dealing with the family law system. These are the most significant changes to the law in three decades and they will take place on 1 July. The first 15 family relationship centres - including a centre at Penrith, in the member's electorate - will open their doors on 3 July, as will the new website and the new family relationships advice line. Combined with significant legislative changes and the biggest investment - some $400 million over four years - in the family law system, we will see a cooperative approach encouraged to deal with the difficult issues surrounding family breakdown. Families will be able to access support at all levels of their relationship. Where separation is inevitable, it will ensure that parents are focused on arrangements that are in the best interests of their children.These reforms have been widely anticipated by most and certainly welcomed, but I am sorry that there are some who have been trying to talk down these initiatives and misrepresent them. For instance, the member for Gellibrand has resisted supporting these changes, despite the fact that a number of colleagues on the parliamentary committee agreed with them. She has had hardly a positive thing to say about them. She said that family relationship centres would be 'sausage factories'. She made out that they would expose women and children to violence, when it is clear that we have put in place arrangements to ensure that should not happen. - I will not spend much time on this, but she also suggested that staff would not be qualified. She begrudged services for families, particularly in the northern suburbs of Sydney because they were represented by the coalition, but failed to acknowledge that 44 per cent of the centres will be in areas covered by the Labor Party. She did not even acknowledge that there would be one in the seat of the Leader of the Opposition and of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, I might just say, she even suggested that there were some difficulties about contractual arrangements - which are in place. But when the first family relationship centres open their doors to Australian families despite the negative views we have heard from the member for Gellibrand, those views will be seen for what they have been: very irrelevant.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the figures quoted by the member for Port Adelaide. I am not saying they are wrong but I would like the opportunity myself to check them. What I had in mind, in reply to the member, when I talked about appropriate 'conditions' or 'circumstances' - I forget which word I used - was a situation where it is appropriate to bring in skilled tradesmen when there is a demonstrable shortage of them in this country. I think most Australians agree with that. I think most Australians bring a commonsense attitude that, if there are adequate numbers of Australians available to fill skilled trades positions, then they should get the jobs and you do not bring in the foreigners but, if there is a shortage of skilled tradesmen, you bring in the foreigners to fill the gap, to keep the industry going - and you keep our prosperity intact.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, for his question. Last night the Lateline program had a very sobering account of a Central Australian community, Mutitjulu, where allegations of child abuse, sexual abuse, serious violence, trafficking of petrol and other substance abuse were put to the test. Doctors, youth workers and workers in women's shelters came forward and gave evidence - as did a senior female elder from Mutitjulu who gave some very moving testimony - about the heart-rending pain caused by the crimes that have been committed in their community. These are things which we hope to address directly and fully at the summit next week with our state and territory ministerial colleagues, in a bipartisan approach which can put an end to these blights on our society. The program last night on Lateline clearly demonstrated that there is an absolute need to restore law and order in these communities today. Unfortunately, it was also sobering to hear from the doctor and others that this is not restricted to Mutitjulu. As many in this place have heard before, it is very widespread.During the week I met with the National Indigenous Council, and we discussed these issues. They are an advisory body to the ministerial task force, and many of my colleagues were present at that meeting. They raised many important issues and gave good advice to government. One recommendation to government that I am taking up is to have an independent audit of the safety of these communities and the need and appropriateness of policing in these Indigenous communities to ensure that they have the same right as others to a safe environment and that their children are free from the predators that were described in this program.Dr Sue Gordon, herself a magistrate in Western Australia and the chair of the National Indigenous Council, had this to say:An audit is the only way we will get a true picture of the actual needs and resources required at each community. A national audit may also shed light on the number of police stationed in a community at any one time. Police numbers may be higher on paper than the numbers actually stationed in communities. It is important to understand the true situation.The federal government is spending some $2 million to provide a police station to Mutitjulu. We all understand that policing has always been a state and territory responsibility, but we also understand that this situation is a national disgrace and that it needs a national response - and we are willing to step up to the plate and work with our colleagues in addressing those needs. The NIC also recommended that we fast-track cases involving sexual abuse so that perpetrators are not back in the communities where often, in doing so, they are able to reap what is called in these communities 'retribution' or 'payback'. The recommendations included: a greater use of protected bail conditions; the supporting of boarding schools to remove children from dangerous environments - expenditure on that was also increased in the last budget; and that it was important not to ignore these problems occurring in urban areas. I say this to the lady who wrote to me from Perth this week and to the numerous other Indigenous people who called my office and said, 'We know that this is a remote Australia problem, but please don't forget us, because there is pain in many Australian communities - in regional Australia and remote Australia but equally in some of our suburban areas and our cities as well.' We will not be forgetting them.Finally, I am asking the states and territories to come here with goodwill and with an acknowledgment that this is a problem that we must deal with today. We do need more police. They have to be where they are needed. We need better interaction between the courts and the police. We need to engage locals and empower them so that women, in particular, can feel that they can talk to someone in confidence and in trust about the pain and indignities that they have suffered. It will take a coordinated and comprehensive approach, and the federal government stands ready to deliver that to make the lives of Australian people safer and better so as to realise the same opportunities that we all take for granted.</DOC>

Some of them are still under investigation. The celebrated one involving Teys Bros in Naracoorte in South Australia was investigated and the allegation was found to be incorrect. I say to the member for Blaxland that the member for Oxley raised a particular query with me yesterday. I have responded to him, indicating that that matter is being investigated. I do not pretend for a moment that everybody involved in business in Australia is lilywhite, and I would not rule out the possibility that some people do not do the right thing, but you do not damn a whole program on the basis of that. Where you have specific allegations, you raise them and you have them investigated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I appreciate his concern to preserve rural health services, a concern which is shared by many members on this side of the House, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, as demonstrated recently. I am aware that the New South Wales health department will close the specialist children's ward on weekends at Goulburn Hospital starting this weekend. A children's ward that is shut on weekends means that children will have to face potentially dangerous transfers. I quote Dr Andrew Keegan of the New South Wales AMA, who said:Young children on drips or needing oxygen will need to be transferred to adult wards or to other hospitals such as Canberra, an hour's drive away. There is a strong likelihood of cross-infection.This weekend closure of the specialist children's ward at Goulburn Hospital comes on top of the closure last year of 12 surgical beds at Goulburn Hospital. This is not the first time that the Greater Southern Area Health Service has been in trouble. I am advised by the member for Eden-Monaro that last year small businesses in his electorate had to wait up to four months to have their bills paid by this health service. I am advised by the member for Riverina that the Greater Southern Area Health Service hospitals in her area have sometimes had no milk because the local milk vendor had not been paid. Sometimes motor vehicles have been grounded because the registration has not been paid and the ambulance has not been operational because the petrol bill has not been paid. - This is simply unacceptable behaviour from a New South Wales agency. Whatever is happening in Goulburn and elsewhere in this health area, there is certainly no lack of money in Macquarie Street. The Commonwealth government is giving New South Wales public hospitals almost $14 billion under the health care agreements. Then of course there is the $10 billion that the New South Wales government is getting this year through the GST.I want to say to the New South Wales government that the closure of the children's ward at Goulburn Hospital is a clear breach of the Australian health care agreement, and I call on the New South Wales government to immediately honour its obligations to the people of Goulburn and to other people living in southern New South Wales.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. With some 800 cane growers in his electorate, I well understand his concern since a disease outbreak was officially diagnosed on a property at Childers on 12 June. This is the first known case of smut disease in eastern Australia, although it has previously been found and contained in Western Australia in the Ord in 1998. This is an extremely serious disease which could significantly reduce the yield of Queensland's billion dollar sugar industry, with around $100 million of this originating in and around the Bundaberg region in the honourable member's electorate of Hinkler.As of today, the disease has been confirmed on 12 properties. Each of these properties has been quarantined and the movement of plants and machinery off these properties has been prohibited. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, in conjunction with all sectors of the industry, have moved swiftly and with great competence. We are working closely with the Queensland government and the industry to determine the nature and extent of the outbreak. Indications are that, currently, smut disease in Queensland is a controlled incursion and there is no evidence yet that the disease is spreading widely. The Australian government, specifically officers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, are providing leadership and technical expertise and have been fully involved from the moment the suspected diseased plants were first identified.The government has moved to invoke the emergency plant pest response deed, which sees government and industry working together to implement a national response to an emergency plant pest such as this. The response team has some 30 field staff, including experts from both industry and government, on the ground working long hours and weekends. While this outbreak is of grave concern to growers, I have been enormously impressed by the sophistication and the maturity of the response. Nobody is panicking or losing their heads, even in the face of such a grave crisis. Instead, they are focused on containing the outbreak. The disease has been found only in a small geographical area and it spreads slowly. I can assure members of the House, especially the member for Hinkler, that the government will continue to work closely with Queensland and the sugarcane industry on this issue.</DOC>

 - I am not aware, nor is it possible for me to be aware, of the individual circumstances of the almost 10,000 changes in employment - I am told 10,000 people a week around Australia go into or go out of jobs. As the member for Perth knows, it is quite impossible for me to know the individual circumstances. But, generally speaking in relation to unfair dismissals, I do know that over the 12 or 13 years that unfair dismissal laws have operated in Australia they have cost tens of thousands of jobs. There have been tens of thousands of Australians who otherwise would have had jobs in this country who have not. I also know that there was a near universal call from the Australian small business community for a change in the area of unfair dismissals.It was a call that had even lapped upon some Labor shores. It had even reached the Hunter, where the member for the electorate bearing that name is a person I know has spoken on occasions in favour of getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws because he does have a little resonance with small business. I think his wife has a very successful small business. The truth is that there was justification for changing the unfair dismissal laws, and I do not run away from the fact that we have changed them in relation to firms employing fewer than 100 people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for that question. The member for Grey is a terrific guy too - he is a great guy and he has a great electorate. He has been a part of the roll-out of the family assistance offices right across Australia. When we came into human services and we linked Centrelink with Medicare and a range of other agencies, it became immediately apparent that we could get better services to more families by rolling out services in Medicare offices across Australia. The Howard government are very proud of what we do for families in Australia, so we want more families to be able to access more benefits and to get access to more money. - Toxic! There are 238 Medicare offices in Australia, and so far this year we have rolled out family assistance services to 150 of those offices, including those three in the electorate of the member for Grey at Port Pirie, Whyalla and Port Lincoln. The good news is that more than 100,000 families have already accessed this service through those Medicare offices.There are parts of Australia that do not have Medicare offices or even, for that matter, Centrelink offices. I know one town in the member for Grey's electorate - Mungeranie. I am sure all my colleagues have been to Mungeranie. It is 1,000 kilometres north of Adelaide, 1,000 kilometres west of Broken Hill, sitting on the Birdsville Track with a population of three. They may want to access Medicare services. They might want to access Centrelink services - John and Genevieve Hammond out there. They can do it by telephone or online, even though I think they are unlikely to access the maternity payment. Ten people per day access the maternity payment, and the maternity payment is going up to $4,000 on 1 July. If that is not an encouragement to have more children, then I do not know what is. I am going to give it a shot! We must be close to the summer break - the winter break, I mean! - Out of all of this, Australian families can access the family tax benefit through these FAOs; 1.8 million Australian families get family tax benefit part A; 1.3 million Australian families get family tax benefit part B; 574,000 Australian families get the child-care benefit; and 200,000 Australian families have accessed the maternity payment in the first nine months of this year. My colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing has said that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. The Howard government is the best friend Australian families have ever had.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I would have thought protection of Australian children was not only an absolute priority but also in the political interests of all political parties. I do not think it is exclusively in the interests of my party any more than it ought to be in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. The reason we have adopted the policy outlined yesterday by the Minister for Communications, Information Economy and the Arts is that it achieves the goals of providing protection for Australian children without imposing the unreasonable restrictions and cost burdens of the Labor Party's policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and acknowledge her very strong support for small business in her electorate. I understand the concern expressed by the member for McPherson in her question. I can tell her and other members of this House that, yes, I do know that, if ever the Leader of the Opposition were given the opportunity to make the sorts of changes that he wants, small businesses in her electorate and every electorate represented here in this House would be hurt and there would be a loss of jobs.The Howard government's Work Choices legislation has delivered a simpler, fairer and more flexible system for small businesses. They have definitely benefited from our getting rid of unfair dismissal, the reduction of red tape and increased productivity. This would all be at risk if the Leader of the Opposition were to ever get that opportunity. I would like to record in the Hansard what small business people themselves say. Diana Williams of Fernwood Women's Health Club - and I know there is a Fernwood in the member for McPherson's and the member for Deakin's electorates - said:Ninety-nine per cent of my staff are female, and they are very happy with our AWA arrangements as they provide flexibility and accommodate the kinds of conditions that women in the workforce are looking for. The Opposition's move to abolish AWAs -  - This is so important I will repeat it:The Opposition's move to abolish AWAs is very disappointing and a step backwards for small business operators.A step backwards. What small business knows is that Labor is no friend to small business.</DOC>

We actually had a lengthy discussion about the government's policy on telecommunications and the commitments that the government made last year when we passed that legislation through this place. As you would expect, and as you know very well, Mr Williams is a great advocate for himself and his peers in business in the area of Inverell -

 - I thank the outstanding member for Kalgoorlie -  - for the question. The member represents one of the largest electorates in the world, covering some 33 council areas. I am very pleased to inform the member, and to inform the House, that those 33 councils in the electorate of Kalgoorlie will receive before 30 June this year a supplementary Roads to Recovery payment of $12,920,000 that they can use on building better and safer roads in their council areas. That is of course on top of the first payment this year of another $12,920,000.I note that some 18 mayors from south-east Queensland visited Canberra yesterday to talk about road funding. I am pleased to inform those 18 mayors from the councils in south-east Queensland that they will also receive before 30 June $22,246,000 in extra payments for their councils so they can get on with building better and safer roads. Of course, for the Brisbane City Council that also includes a $7,156,000 extra payment on top of the $26 million that Brisbane council received in financial assistance grants this year. I am sure that the member for Lilley, the member for Brisbane and the member for Griffith will welcome that extra payment to the Brisbane City Council and to councils all around Australia.</DOC>

 - There have been disputes involving two airports, Adelaide and Perth, in relation to the payment of rates. In the case of Perth, the Westralia Airports Corporation have reached agreement with two of their three local authority areas but not the third. There are difficult negotiations going on at the present time in an endeavour to resolve these issues. I do not seek to inflame the issues any further by making additional comments, other than to say that we will be working diligently and carefully with the City of West Torrens Council and the City of Belmont in an endeavour to have the issues resolved promptly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for an excellent question. He is a go-ahead guy in a go-ahead part of south-east Queensland. I will illustrate that point by making it plain that in 1996 the federal electorate of Bowman came 52nd in the ranking as far as unemployment is concerned - 52nd best in Australia. Now it is the 20th best. It is No. 20. That in itself underscores the fact that 3.2 per cent unemployment is the figure in Bowman today, which shows that around Cleveland and Redlands there has been a terrific amount of development with businesses investing in themselves. The best way that businesses can invest in themselves is to take on apprentices.The Australian government is backing that decision of Australian business with record amounts of incentives and benefits to both employers and apprentices. Some $571 million in the coming financial year is anticipated, with $43.7 million in personal benefits directed to apprentices themselves. If we go back to a full set of figures that can be properly analysed from the 2001-02 financial year, we see that employers spent $3.6 billion in direct expenditure on structured training. This in fact represented a 52 per cent increase on where they were at in 1996. There we were five years ago: employers realised that investment in training was important and they were getting on with it.The recent Australian Industry Group report, World class skills for world class industries, looking and talking to business, outlined that a 30 per cent increase on top of that is anticipated by Australian business over the next three years. All I can say to the member for Bowman and all members in this place is that the prospect for further job growth is very real. Factored in, of course, with the Australian government's Work Choices legislation, we will see businesses being confident enough to invest in themselves by taking on more apprentices. This provides opportunities for young people to get a start in a job and thorough training to develop technical and employable skills. They, of course, also help to create the employers of the future. We know on this side that, when we came to office, we saw just 161,500 people in training in 1995-96. There are now almost 400,000 people in training in this country. That is an increase of 141 per cent.Government members are always attentive to this point: the low point in Australia's history was back in 1993 when the employment of apprentices reached its lowest ever ebb of just 122,700 people. And who was in charge? Who presided over the single biggest drop in Australia's history? The now member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. As I think he will know, the government has already given some $5 million. We will consider adding to that. It is true that Australia has a very significant population of people of Lebanese descent. Let me take this opportunity to record my, the government's and, I think, the Australian people's immense respect for the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in arranging for the withdrawal from Lebanon of something in the order of 5,000 Australian citizens. To the best of my knowledge, not one death or injury has been occasioned to an Australian citizen for want, in reasonable terms, of a speedier facilitation. I think it is a remarkable effort and it does rather fly in the face of some very foolish things that were said at the beginning of this by a number of those opposite and a number of spokesmen for the Lebanese community in Australia.Let me say that Lebanese Australians almost without exception as they have returned to this country have expressed their gratitude to the Australian government and their gratitude to the Australian ambassador in Beirut, Lyndall Sachs, which I also record - and I had the opportunity of talking to her directly - who has done a first-class job in very difficult circumstances. Sometimes self-appointed community spokesmen ought to bear in mind that when ambassadors and embassy staff in these situations try to help Australians overseas they risk their lives in doing so. The ambassador remains in the danger of Beirut. The ambassador is staying at her post. She is doing her job on behalf of the Australian people and I take this opportunity on behalf, I hope, of all members of the House to express my great gratitude and admiration for her in the job she has done. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his department have done a superb job in safely evacuating 5,000 Australians and some of those people who criticise him, including the Leader of the Opposition, ought to eat their words.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can inform him that the OECD released its report last week on Australia. The OECD survey noted that Australia's recent macro-economic performance since the turn of the millennium has averaged around three per cent and growth in real domestic income averaged four per cent, placing Australia amongst a handful of OECD countries which achieved such rapid growth. The unemployment rate has fallen to five per cent, and the OECD noted in its report that:_ Australia is now one of the few OECD countries where general government net debt has been eliminated.That is because this government has now relieved Australia of Labor's $96 billion of net debt.The OECD report was picked up by the Financial Times of London, which in its editorial on 1 August wrote the following:What can you say about an economy that is a textbook case of good policies, well executed? That is the challenge facing the authors of the latest survey of Australia by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development _The Financial Times went on to say:Though the OECD identifies some causes for concern, its report card is mostly straight 'A's.The list of achievements is impressive. After years of sustained growth, Australia enjoys higher living standards than all the Group of Seven economies except the US.Let me stop there. After 10 years of economic management, living standards in Australia now exceed the living standards of every one of the G7 countries with the exception of the United States. The OECD said that this was the result of impressive reform - reforms like balancing the budget, repaying $96 billion of debt, introducing the GST, reducing income taxes and reforming industrial relations. All of those reforms were opposed by Labor, and if Labor has its way it will roll Australia back to where it was suffering under the poor administration of the Labor Party back in the 1990s. The coalition has turned Australia's fortunes for the better, and that is the pay-off from reform.</DOC>

 - Yes, I'm real nervous, Jenny! She's got me on the run! Perhaps I can best respond to that question asked by the Leader of the Opposition by referring to a question that I was asked on this subject not after the election but before the election. It was a question asked of me by Neil Mitchell of 3AW in Melbourne. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows Mr Mitchell. He is about the most respected radio broadcaster in Melbourne at least and he is amongst the very best in the country. This is what he had to say. This was the question:So you wouldn't be embarrassed to win the election and then have an interest rates rise _That is a fair question, and that is what has happened. We won the election and there has been an interest rate rise. This is what this debate is all about. You know what my answer was? This was on 23 September 2004. This is what I had to say:Well I don't seek to give guarantees, judgements about individual movements. My argument is that they will - The member for Parramatta then left the chamber. - I said:Well I don't seek to give guarantees, judgements about individual movements. My argument is that they will always be lower under our policies and that argument is supported by the last time Labor was in government and the impact of their industrial relations policies.The truth is that under 13 years of Labor interest rates on housing averaged 12¾ per cent; under 10 years of this government they have averaged 7¼ per cent - five percentage points lower. Every homeowner in Australia over a certain age, their children and, in some cases, their grandchildren know that under the former government housing interest rates reached the astronomical level of 17 per cent. I believe that the government's credibility as the parties in politics best able to deliver lower interest rates remains absolutely unchallenged.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, first can I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. He made many representations for support for constituents of his, and family and friends of constituents of his, who were caught in Lebanon after the fighting broke out on 13 July.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade started off with a situation where it was estimated there were 25,000 Australians in Lebanon and, with a tremendous amount of determination and in the most difficult circumstances imaginable, have evacuated 5,200 Australians or permanent residents and their families. Now, most of these people - not quite all, but most - have been evacuated to Cyprus and Turkey, using 16 voyages on six different chartered ships. The fact is, Mr Speaker, the evacuees were provided with transit accommodation and other assistance before boarding aircraft which were chartered by the government for a trip to Australia. And so far more than 4,600 of the evacuees have already returned to Australia.I just want to make the point that the major phase of the evacuation is now complete but some capacity still remains. We obviously have to take into consideration, in particular, around 100 people who we believe - we are not sure - are trapped in southern Lebanon, who would like to get out and are unable to do so. So we are continuing to do everything we can to try to evacuate that group of people - working with the United Nations, the Red Cross, privately organised convoys and, obviously, other partner governments. But the security in southern Lebanon rather obviously remains very dangerous. It remains volatile, and any further evacuations would be extremely difficult.I would like, in conclusion, to join with the Prime Minister and say that the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did a simply extraordinary job evacuating 5,200 people, 15,000 kilometres away. Some people were saying, 'Well, the French can get people out, and the Spanish and so on.' Those countries are on the Mediterranean Sea, as I think all members would be aware. Australia happens to be 15,000 kilometres away from the Mediterranean Sea and it was a simply massive undertaking for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Yesterday, I went down to the department and met with the officers who have done this excellent work at the Australian end, and I made the point to them that the Australian people were proud of what they had done. And I add - because she obviously could not be there - that we are very proud of what the ambassador, Lyndall Sachs, and her staff over there in Beirut have done, in trying circumstances, and showing enormous courage.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the truth is that housing loans are larger today because people are wealthier today than they were 10 years ago -  - and the value of their homes is higher. And I thought even the member for Lilley would understand that if the value of your home is greater then the loan you need to buy that home has to be greater. But let me content myself as I cast around for a description of the state of the Australian economy at the present time. I found some words spoken on 30 July 2006. These words were:... Barrie, because times have been good, unemployment is low, the economy is relatively prosperous ...I couldn't have put it better myself. Wayne Swan, Insiders, 30 July 2006.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I can inform him that the Australian census, which is taking place tonight, is something that is important for all Australians. The census will be used to allocate over $40 billion of GST revenues to the states and the territories. It will underpin the delivery of health services and educational services. It is important for overall demographic trends and it is a five-year snapshot of the importance of our society in terms of its income, ethnic background and, of course, overall population.There will be three new topics in this year's census: whether a person needs assistance in day-to-day activities, the type of internet connection households have, and whether voluntary or unpaid work or caring is being carried out - this will give us a fixture for the first time of the amount of voluntary work that is going on in our society. There is also a fourth question, which is only asked on a more infrequent basis, which is a question about female fertility. The question is used for estimating Australia's future population figures and is very important to work out what Australia's future population will be, particularly the ageing of the population and the demand which we will be having for childcare centres, nursing homes and the like.I emphasise the census is confidential. Nobody need disclose their name but there is an option, if a person chooses to do so, to have the information kept for 99 years by the National Archives and then it will be available to historians, genealogists and their own descendants. There are some people who want the right to do that for the sake of their own descendants.There is a 98 per cent compliance rate with the census. There is enormous cooperation from Australian households and I thank Australian households in advance for taking part in that. I will certainly be going back to my flat with my two flatmates and we will be disclosing the nature of our household - two married men with a single boarder sitting in a flat - which will no doubt add to the interest of the social composition of various family types in Australia. Who knows what the genealogists will make of our household in 99 years time - two married men with a single boarder in Canberra on 8 August 2006. No doubt, there will be others in this House who have even stranger family relationships, but I invite all members of the House to take part in the census tonight.</DOC>

 - I very happily and readily concede that people pay more for their houses now than they did 10 or 20 years ago and as a result they borrow more. It stands to reason that if you are richer with your assets, in order to acquire those assets you have to borrow more money. That is the explanation for what the Reserve Bank said. - On any measure, including measures used by the Reserve Bank, this country is wealthier than it was 10 years ago. Average Australians are better off than they were 10 years ago. The debts are higher but the assets are larger. It is a matter of elementary economic logic.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I think all members of the House acknowledge his interest in and experience and professionalism of issues of foreign affairs. Obviously, the government is deeply concerned about the loss of life in the Middle East since the fighting began on 13 July. With that in mind, we welcome the United Nations Security Council's consideration of a draft resolution which has been drawn up, in particular, by France and the United States and which was brought forward on Sunday. I hope that this will be voted on soon.This resolution calls for a full cessation of hostilities - that is, for Hezbollah, a terrorist organisation, to stop all attacks and in that circumstance for Israel to stop offensive operations and for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire based on a set of principles, including strict respect by all parties for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries, and full implementation of resolutions requiring the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon. As I said, I hope this resolution can be agreed on quickly and pave the way for a cessation of hostilities and for a second resolution which would mandate an international stabilisation force under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. But let me make the Australian government's position perfectly clear on this. We are not interested in seeing some kind of temporary solution - or bandaid solution - which several months or a year down the track is going to fall apart and when there will simply be a resumption of hostilities and more people will be killed. Now, out of this crisis, there is the opportunity to achieve a sustainable peace built around a quite simple and obvious proposition: that there must be a two-state solution to this problem.Israel must be guaranteed by all parties its right to exist within secure borders and there must be the establishment of a Palestinian state. It is important that people understand that the problem here is that, while most countries in the world agree with that, there are some countries that do not. Amongst those countries that do not support the two-state solution are Iran and Syria. They are funding, supporting, aiding and abetting terrorist organisations Hezbollah and Hamas. They are supporting those organisations, which equally do not support Israel's right to exist.Some people say that Israel should negotiate with Hezbollah and Hamas or Iran and Syria. Those countries and those organisations do not believe Israel has a right to exist. The only thing Israel has to negotiate with those countries and those organisations is its own country. They have nothing else to offer, because those countries and those organisations want to eliminate Israel from the face of the earth, to use the words of President Ahmadinejad of Iran.We completely reject that. It is not that we are somehow biased or play to domestic constituencies, or anything like that. It is simply that Israel has a right to exist, and so does a Palestinian state have a right to come into existence. That is the only solution here. For those who think that they can solve the problem of the Middle East by trying to destroy Israel, the simple answer is that they will not. All they will do is cause war. That is all they will do. Some people on the other side may mock, as the member for Sydney does, but my view is that all those people will do is cause war. I have made it perfectly clear -  -  - She just laughed at me! -  - Don't be so sensitive. Why are you sniggering? - You were sniggering at me; I will not withdraw it. -  - The second point to that point of order is this: the Minister for Foreign Affairs said a great deal more about the member for Sydney than simply characterising her attitude. He went on to describe the member for Sydney - I am sure, if you check the record - as having a particular attitude towards war and encouraging it. Quite frankly, they were utterly offensive remarks. The member for Sydney took objection -  - Mr Speaker, I did not say she supported war. Of course I did not. I think she is objecting to my saying, as she sniggered, that she was mocking me on a serious issue. I would suggest that, on a serious issue, the opposition, instead of sniggering at ministers talking about it, do not do so in the future - and they won't get themselves into trouble. It is as simple as that.</DOC>

 - New Zealand, of course, has substantially higher interest rates than Australia, because New Zealand has had nearly as strong a growth as Australia. But, as I said earlier, Australia has had stronger growth than every country in the OECD and, in living standards, has overtaken all the countries of the G7 except for the United States. Let me make this point: the standard variable mortgage interest rate is 7.8 per cent, and the Reserve Bank noted in its decision that many people pay less than that. That was one of the things that it put into its statement. We can measure that mortgage interest rate against the historical situation in Australia. Under this government, the mortgage interest rate has averaged 7.16 per cent, whereas under the Labor Party it averaged 12¾ per cent. - The standard variable mortgage interest rate, which is now 7.8 per cent, compares with the mortgage interest rate of 10.5 per cent when this government was elected. So, if you look at it in comparison with the Australian experience, and if you especially look at it by comparison with the Australian Labor Party's record, these are substantially lower interest rates than under the previous government and lower than they would be under the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I am sure that, on behalf of the beef exporters, the sheep meat exporters, the dairy products exporters and the wine industry in his electorate, he is interested in knowing where the global trade negotiations are heading from here. From the outset, can I say that it was disappointing that discussions a few weeks ago broke down, as they did in Geneva. That was a disappointment not only for Australia's farmers and exporters but also for many of the developing countries across the world that are looking for an outcome in this round to give their economies the opportunity to grow and expand.In answer to the member for Barker's question, this round of negotiations is not dead. It is very close to just hanging on by a thread but it is not dead. The opportunity still exists to close the gap. What members opposite also know is that there are 149 members of the WTO and they all have to agree on an outcome. Australia has been playing the role of an honest broker in trying to bring the major parties closer and closer together so that we can deliver on the objectives we have set ourselves. There has been some significant progress made since we launched this round in 2001, and I instance one aspect of it. There was a commitment at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting last year to eliminate export subsidies by 2013. That would mean, for example, the opportunity of an extra $600 million worth of business for the Australian dairy industry if those export subsidies were eliminated. That opportunity is still in prospect.We know what is needed to be done to achieve an ambitious outcome on market access in agriculture and industrial goods, and we know what is required to be done to achieve an ambitious outcome in reducing the level of domestic support for agriculture across the world, so we have been playing an honest broker role. We remained in contact with the major players since the negotiations were suspended in Geneva. In fact, in the coming weeks and months, we will be participating at different levels in discussions to try to restart these negotiations. Meetings are coming up with ASEAN ministers in Malaysia in a couple of weeks time, and we will be hosting a meeting of the 20th annual meeting of the Cairns Group, a group started during the Uruguay Round in Cairns -  -  - And by Labor; I acknowledge that. The Cairns Group was established during the course of the Uruguay Round, and it is still alive and exercising influence today. In November the APEC ministers and leaders will be meeting in Vietnam, and we aim to continue to raise the level of ambition with colleagues at all these meetings to try to take advantage of the window of opportunity that still remains open. It is still this government's No. 1 trade policy objective to get a conclusion to this round. We are not prepared to agree to an outcome that has a low level of ambition and does not deliver for agriculture and our exporters of industrial goods and services. We want a highly ambitious outcome to deliver benefits to the exporting industries in Australia, because it is only that way - through our trade policy objectives - that they will deliver on our objectives of keeping the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

 - I have seen those remarks by Debbie Bridgman - is it? Let me say to her, and let me say to families all around Australia, that last week's interest rate rise was not something that anybody in the community welcomed. However, it was an unavoidably sensible and responsible response by the Reserve Bank of Australia to a number of factors. As I said at the time, and I repeat it here, the action taken by the Reserve Bank at the time it was taken could well have reduced the likelihood of more severe action being taken in the future.As my response to Neil Mitchell on the eve of the last election indicated, at no stage in the last election campaign did I give guarantees that interest rates would never rise. What I said - and as sure as I stand here at the dispatch box, I know it to be true - was that interest rates under the coalition will always be lower than they are under a Labor government. I would say to Debbie Bridgman that, if you are really interested in long-term interest rate sustainability and affordability, please do not vote Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. It is true that in June this year the ACTU commenced a series of advertisements claiming to be the real experiences of Australians under Work Choices. Those experiences have been investigated by the independent umpire, the Office of Workplace Services, to see whether any rights of workers were being abused. The result of that investigation was that the Office of Workplace Services, an independent body, found that these claims were phoney and misleading. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. I remind him that, in the last election campaign, he promised to put more money into the Office of Workplace Services. - What we have now is the secretary of the ACTU and the opposition attacking the umpire, the Office of Workplace Services, simply because it has revealed that these advertisements were phoney and misleading. This week the ACTU has launched a new series of ads but, instead of these being the real experiences of ordinary Australians, they are now using actors. They are now using actors in this new series of ads. - Why are they using actors? Because it was shown that what was in the previous series of ads was misleading and did not stack up. What we have here is the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party dipping their hands into the pockets of ordinary working Australians and ripping out $20 million to pay for a series of deceptive and misleading ads. That is what has happened, and that is what the Office of Workplace Services has shown. -  -  - What the Leader of the Opposition has just confirmed is that he is prepared to attack the independent umpire on the orders of Greg Combet and the ACTU -  -  - These are honest Australian public servants doing their job, and they do not deserve that sort of description from the Leader of the Opposition. The only reason they get it is that the Office of Workplace Services dared to reveal the truth about the misleading ads from the ACTU. At the start of this campaign, the Leader of the Opposition and the unions said that the new laws would be a green light for mass sackings in Australia. What has happened in the last couple of months is that we have seen 100,000 new jobs created in Australia. That is what we have seen. We are proud of these laws. We are not going to rip them up and go back to the 1980s and the sort of economy that the Leader of the Opposition was partly responsible for. We are about building the prosperity of this country, and these reforms are about doing that.</DOC>

 - I have not read last week's issue of the Catholic Weekly. I apologise to the Catholics in the House for not having done so. I accept I apologise particularly to some of those opposite and behind me, but I am not surprised - may I be frank and, I hope, courteously frank to His Grace - that Bishop Manning should have made those comments. Over the years I think Bishop Manning on a number of issues has been quite critical of the government's policies. I respect his right to do that, but I would point out that even a Catholic bishop does not speak for all Catholics in this country. I know many devout mass-going Catholics who are very strong supporters of this legislation. I know that they have absolutely no difficulty in reconciling support for this legislation with their Catholic faith. We have been talking a little bit about politics and the Christian heritage in the last few days, and I think it is very important to make the obvious statement that there is no such thing as a Catholic position on industrial relations. I do not claim any particular support of Christian doctrine in relation to it. - I think many of these issues are such that, if you read the Bible conscientiously, you could probably find some passages that supported our point of view and you could find some passages that supported the other point of view. I think if we are sensible, we will not try to invoke the plot for either side of the argument. If we are to have a sensible debate on the merits of this legislation, my advice to every person on this side of the House is: let's leave out of the debate indications by the clergy to either side of the argument. As to the substance of what I said on Meet the Press, do you know what I had ringing in my ears? - It was not the words of Bishop Manning or indeed the words of somebody of the cloth who was supporting our legislation. What I had ringing in my ears was the denunciation of the ACTU advertisements by the Office of Workplace Services. We had a number of examples. We had the lady who had worked for the RSL. What Greg Combet's ad did not disclose - there was no reference to it - was that she received a severance payment which was above what she was entitled to by law. What the Office of Workplace Services revealed -  - As I was saying, what was ringing in my ears - and as I remember correctly and I think I heard it correctly, the member for Perth asked me about my interview on Meet the Press - was what Greg Combet's ad said was that the workers at the Cowra Abattoir had been unfairly treated as a result of the Work Choices legislation. What was found by the Office of Workplace Services was that the firm was losing money because of, inter alia, the drought; therefore, it had no alternative but to let staff go. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and everybody who sits behind him that, back in the early 1990s, many firms in Australia were going broke and those opposite had a very highly regulated industrial relations system. The member for Gorton then left the chamber. 
 - What I also had ringing in my ears was, having read the Australian the previous day, there was reported a case before the -  - The ringing in my ears was the case of the former employee of that union in Victoria, the union that is run by - who is it? - Dean Mighell. In this case, an employee of the union was taking the union to the IRC complaining about an unfair dismissal. I wonder what law she was using. But the interesting thing is not what she was doing but what Dean's response was. He said, 'This is all nonsense' - he did not quite say that, but that will do for parliament - 'this is not an unfair dismissal, this is a genuine redundancy.' In other words, when Cowra Abattoir does it, it is outrageous but, when the union does it, it is a genuine redundancy. That is what I mean by phoney.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and for his very strong commitment to the Townsville defence community. Traditionally Australians have considered, understandably, Australia's defence as relating directly to Australia itself, but in this century as things have changed so too has our defence strategic outlook. Defending and protecting our people, our interests and our values relates to protecting not only our borders but also countries in our region and indeed the global interests of Australia. In that regard, as we go forward it is obvious that the security of countries in our region relates directly to the security of Australia. And so the Australian Defence Force has been called upon recently - and is likely to be again in the foreseeable future - to support, amongst other things, the protection of borders in countries in our region and the stabilisation of governments and security in countries in the Pacific region and other parts of Asia. We are also required to support humanitarian and disaster relief. At the moment Australia is actively involved in counter-terrorism arrangements in a number of countries.I think we all recall the Boxing Day 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. We were all impressed that within 48 hours the Australian Defence Force was providing humanitarian relief. We were all impressed in April this year when we saw 110 specialist troops fully armed in combat gear deployed within less than 24 hours to the Solomon Islands. The Defence Force peaked at 400 in the Solomons. Similarly, in May we saw the Australian Defence Force go into East Timor at the request of the East Timorese government to provide and support peace and security. In all of that Australians should be equally proud of the courage and efforts of the Australian Federal Police. Very often we see the high-profile activities of the Australian Defence Force and the Army, but working alongside them in these countries is the Australian Federal Police.It is extremely important to us as Australians that we appreciate that we cannot afford to have failing states in our region. The so-called arc of instability, which basically goes from East Timor through to the south-west Pacific states, means not only that Australia does have a responsibility to prevent humanitarian disaster and assist with humanitarian and disaster relief but also that we cannot allow any of these countries to become havens for transnational crime or indeed havens for terrorism. We are extremely proud of the efforts of the Australian Defence Force. We will be building on those in the future. Australia has a responsibility in protecting our own interests and values to support the defence and protection of the interests and values of these countries in our region.</DOC>

 - I did not make the prediction attributed to me. I said that there was in the immediate term no likelihood of it going down but I entertained the hope - and I think I used that expression rather than making an educated projection - that it was possible that it might return to a lower level, and I think I did indicate that. I gave no time frame to it. I do not in any way withdraw what I said. I am grateful that what the member for Hunter has done by his question is to confirm the fact that the price of petrol is overwhelmingly governed by the world price of crude oil. I think that is a very valuable acknowledgement in the current debate and I thank him for it.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Solomon for his question and I thank him for his consistent interest in this very important topic. I can inform the House that successive federal, state and territory governments have consistently invested more resources in better health facilities for Indigenous people. Since 1997 the number of Aboriginal medical services funded by the federal government has increased from 108 to 183 and there has been an 87 per cent increase in the number of episodes of health care given to Indigenous people. Spending on Aboriginal medical services has increased from $100 million in 1996 to $350 million a year now. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous doctors and a 30 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous nurses. It is one thing to spend more money; it is another thing to see measurable improvements in Indigenous health. There has been some encouraging recent news.A study just published in the Medical Journal of Australia shows that in the Northern Territory - and this will be of particular interest to the member for Solomon - the increase in diabetes death rates has slowed from 13 per cent to three per cent a year over the period from 1992 to 2001. The increase in heart disease death rates has slowed from six per cent to one per cent a year. Lung disease death rates, which were increasing at three per cent a year, are now dropping at six per cent a year. I see that the member for Lalor is giggling. No-one should be complacent about this. This does suggest that in at least some areas government policy is working.I notice that on the weekend the Leader of the Opposition came out with a commitment to entirely eliminate Indigenous health disadvantage within two terms of government. I welcome that commitment, because I have to say that this government has no monopoly of wisdom or insight in this area. I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to specify precisely what he would do differently. What new programs would he introduce? What new spending would he commence? Because if he cannot say exactly what he would do differently, he is guilty of peddling false hope in an area which is far too important for more Beazley bluster.</DOC>

 - The ACCC monitors the daily average retail prices of unleaded petrol, diesel and automotive LPG at 3,600 sites across Australia. Under a new arrangement which I have announced today, E10 will be included in the ACCC's price monitoring program. There is daily monitoring of 3,600 sites across Australia. From memory, there are around 6,000 sites in Australia, so that is nearly 50 per cent of the sites - although, as I say, I am going from memory. There are 3,600 sites and they are put up on the ACCC website. - I don't even remember what your question was, old son. - The point is that the shadow Treasurer could not possibly be relevant, because no-one cares what his questions are. I will table a statement which has been produced by the ACCC in relation to petrol prices. - I will table for the benefit of the House and both sides of the parliament the prices from the International Energy Agency data on petrol, ex tax and with tax, in the countries of the OECD. It shows that there is a remarkable uniformity in the ex-tax price right across the OECD, that the only substantive variation is in relation to the tax component and that the tax component in Australia is the third lowest in the OECD after the United States and Canada - meaning that in the relevant quarter, which I believe was the March quarter, the price in Australia was up around $1.30, compared with countries such as Norway, where it was about $2.70, and the United Kingdom, where it was about $2.20. I will also table the release I put out in relation to daily average retail price monitoring at 3,600 sites across Australia - and I invite members of parliament who want to access that information to look at the ACCC's website.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question and also for his sage counsel and advice as chair of the backbench task force advising in relation to the implementation of this very important program. I am delighted to be able to advise the House that all 15 family relationship centres opened to the public on schedule at the beginning of July. I might say that that happened notwithstanding suggestions that it may not occur. I commend those who were very much involved in ensuring that this investment of more than $400 million by the Australian government could play a very positive role in the lives of Australian families.In the first month of operation the 15 relationship centres have received more than 2,000 phone calls, and over 720 people have dropped in for assistance with relationship issues. They have conducted more than 1,000 interviews, and hundreds have attended group sessions. The family relationships advice line answered more than 8,600 calls during July. Thousands of information kits about the family law system have been distributed to those seeking advice from the advice line. More than 31,000 visits have been made on the family relationships online website. It is clear that the community is ready to embrace the government's vision in relation to relationship problems, which is that it is better to talk than go to court and that parents should focus on their children rather than treating them like another item of property over which you litigate.I have been officially opening centres over the past few weeks. We have been able to open nine centres so far - at Salisbury, Elizabeth, Hobart, Sutherland, Penrith, Wollongong, Strathpine, Sunshine, Ringwood and Frankston - and I am going to launch the Canberra centre this afternoon. All the centres are staffed by committed and enthusiastic professionals who are concerned with helping families on relationship issues. I have nothing but praise for the good work the staff are undertaking at all the centres I have attended. - The member for Batman does not seem very interested, but I might say that the member for Gellibrand was able to visit the Sunshine centre this week and has seen firsthand the professional and safe advice and service that has been provided. She welcomed the opening of that centre, and I hope she will be able to welcome generally the implementation of these very important measures.</DOC>

 - I am not suggesting that. What I am saying - and let me repeat it again - is that, because of the increase in the cost and value of housing, mortgages have risen very sharply in this country. For example, I am informed that the average mortgage in 1989 was $65,000. That figure is now $220,000 a year. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition that the relevant comparison that ought to be made for the purposes of today's debate is to look at the interest payment today on the average loan and compare it with what it would have been if the interest rates of earlier years had obtained. The interest rate today on the average loan -  - is $1,430 a month. - If you applied the average interest rate of the Labor years - that is, 12¾ per cent - it would be over $2,300 a month. That is being charitable, because it so happens that, in 1989, interest rates hit the notorious level of 17 per cent, and if you applied that to today's loan it would be $3,100 a month. So it is now $1,430. Using the opposition's logic, charitably speaking, if their average interest rate had obtained, it would be $2,300; but, if the interest rate of 1989 had obtained, it would in fact be $3,100 a month.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe -  - for his question and for his interest in superannuation policy. In this year's budget the government brought down the biggest plan to reform superannuation in Australia's political history. - In this year's budget the coalition government announced the biggest reform of Australian superannuation policy in Australia's history. That plan is to take effect on 1 July next year. It will sweep away the raft of taxes on benefits at the end of a person's superannuation plan when they come up to retirement. Even former ACTU member and industry fund advocate Garry Weaven wrote recently in Investor Weekly:The government's recent budget initiatives have proved the Liberal Party is now the official party for superannuation.Let me say that this plan will make a 25-year-old earning $1,000 a week and receiving super guarantee $136 a week better off in retirement. A 45-year-old earning $1,500 a week and receiving the nine per cent super guarantee will be $92 a week better off as a consequence of this plan. The budget was brought down in May this year and the ALP is yet to announce a position in relation to this reform. We are waiting for the Labor Party to actually say whether or not it will support -  An incident having occurred in the chamber -

 - I am aware of a lot of Reserve Bank figures and I am also aware of figures that show that unemployment is at a 30-year low. I am also aware of the fact that, if the average borrower in Australia today were paying the average interest rates of the Hawke-Keating years, instead of paying $1,430 a month they would be paying at least $2,300 a month. If they were paying the notorious 17 per cent interest rate, they would be paying over $4,000 a month. I hope the member for Lilley continues to ask these questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and his interest. As he comes from Darwin, he has a very great interest in the welfare of Australians serving in East Timor. I think the House would be aware that the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police, with the assistance of the Malaysians, the New Zealanders and the Portuguese, have been extraordinarily successful in bringing stability back to East Timor. We are very proud of the job that they have done.I have always made the point that the East Timorese ultimately have to solve their political problems, not the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police or the Australian government. Where there was a breakdown of security in East Timor caused by political arguments and differences, it had to be resolved by the East Timorese. The point I would make is that they have made good progress in addressing their concerns. A new government was sworn in by President Xanana Gusmao on 14 July. At the time, the Prime Minister, the defence minister and I welcomed the appointment of Jose Ramos Horta. Of course, we continue to wish him well in his new and very difficult role. In Kuala Lumpur the week before last, I was also pleased to spend some time with the new foreign minister, Jose Luis Guterres, who is well known to a number of members of this House from the time when he was the permanent representative of East Timor at the United Nations in New York.The next stage in all of this is going to be the United Nations Security Council's consideration of a further resolution to extend the UN mission beyond 21 August. We expect there to be open discussions in the Security Council on 15 August - that is, next week. I think it is more or less agreed that the successor mission to the existing UN mission will strengthen the capacity of the local police. There will be a significant international police presence. It could be very significant, with over 1,000 international police coming under the auspices of the United Nations. The United Nations mission is likely to be charged with the task of encouraging political reconciliation and assisting with the improvement of overall governance in East Timor.The one issue that is still being worked through by the permanent members and with countries such as Australia and Portugal is the role of the military. There clearly will need to be some military presence in East Timor for some time beyond 21 August - some sort of rapid reaction force. There will need to be military liaison officers and so on. But the question is going to be whether it will be a blue-helmeted or, as they say, a 'green-helmeted' operation, which comes under the UN, or whether it will come under a national command with the approval of the UN. That is still to be worked out and is still being discussed in New York. But I think there is a real mood in New York to ensure that there is an effective successor mission to the existing UN mission so that the UN can play a more active role in trying to help the East Timorese overcome their differences and to improve the quality of governance.We are committed to East Timor for the long haul. We will continue to do our best to help them but, in saying that, never detract from the simple point that as an independent country they are responsible for their own decisions. They are responsible for their own destiny. We can help them but we cannot take on that burden of responsibility. That is their job.</DOC>

 - I do not regard household debt as 'irrelevant'; I have never said that at all. What I have said is that what is highly relevant in the current debate is a comparison of the interest rate burdens of two periods. If you take the average mortgage now, the truth is that, whereas the average mortgage now attracts an interest payment of $1,430 a month, if you applied the average of the Hawke-Keating years, that figure would climb to $2,300 a month. If you climbed the dizzy heights of 17 per cent, which people in this country still bitterly remember, it would be $3,100 a month. I think those figures are highly relevant.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and acknowledge his expertise in relation to the building and construction industry, particularly in his home state of Western Australia. The government has made significant progress in bringing about much-needed reform in the $50 billion building and construction industry in Australia. The Cole royal commission presented compelling evidence of an industry replete with unlawful activity, and corruption in some cases, resulting in extensive inefficiencies and increased building costs in the industry. Following the Cole royal commission, the government put in place a comprehensive reform package to address many of the problems identified by Mr Justice Cole in his report.As the member for Hasluck intimated in his question, today the John Holland Group announced the settlement of a longstanding industrial dispute with the CFMEU. This dispute commenced before the government's reforms were in place, and indeed the John Holland group said today that they 'can't see any need for us in our capacity as an employer to take that sort of action again, because there is now a comprehensive legislative regime in place that effectively prevents this sort of unlawful action'. As I said, there has been perhaps no other industry in Australia, such as the building and construction industry, that was in need of a comprehensive clean-up of activities which were taking place. The John Holland Group also reaffirmed its support for the government's legislation, saying, 'We welcome these new laws and are confident that they will assist in securing more productive workplaces.'An important point about this is that the John Holland Group identified that, because of the reforms put in place, efficiencies are being generated in the order of 20 per cent on major building and construction projects in Australia. We know that industrial action in the past has cost up to $200,000 per day on major construction projects in Australia. Of course, that ultimately flows through to the consumers in Australia.For another piece of data about the impact of these reforms put in place by the government one only has to look at the working days lost per 1,000 employees. In the March 2005 quarter, 43.5 working days were lost per 1,000 employees. In March 2006, which was the first period in which data has been recorded since the building and construction industry reforms were put in place, that figure of 43.5 working days lost per 1,000 employees had fallen to just 5.7 working days lost. - As the Prime Minister says, that is great news, and not just for the building construction companies. - It is great news for the workers themselves and for all Australians, because they bear these costs ultimately. So this industry is a clear example of where this government has been prepared to meet challenges and put in place major reforms and we see the economic dividends for all Australians occurring as a result of those changes.What stands in the way of these changes? Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Labor Party, who have promised to rip up these reforms and to turn back this sort of efficiency which ordinary Australians are benefiting from as a result of these changes. They would rip up these reforms. They would take us back to the past. This proves once again that the Australian Labor Party under Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, is not interested in Australia's prosperity. The only parties in this place that are interested in continuing to grow the prosperity of this country are the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - All members of this House when the time comes will face the judgement of the Australian people about all manner of things, including trust. As always, I will both await and accept the judgement of my fellow Australians on those matters. Let me simply say again, respectfully, to all Australians and to members of this House that I did not guarantee that interest rates would never rise. I simply said, and I know it to be true, and most Australians know it to be true, that interest rates under a coalition government would always be lower than they would be under a Labor government. Let me repeat again, in case the Leader of the Opposition did not hear: the average loan repayment today on a monthly basis is $1,430 a month. If the average of the Labor years, the Hawke-Keating years applied, it would climb to $2,300 a month. If we were to reach the bitterly remembered heights of 17 per cent, which generations of Australians who did not pay 17 per cent nonetheless know about, it would be $3,100 a month. I am happy for the Australian people to make a judgement at any time on that comparison.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. Obviously wine export is very important to his electorate as a major contributor to the export effort of Australian agricultural industries. For the information of members, particularly the member for Barker, there has been strong growth in the last 12 months. In the 12 months to July, we exported a record 743 million litres of wine from Australia. If you hark back about a decade, nowhere near that amount of export was going out of Australia. It is a great tribute to the great Australian wine industry that this has been achieved. Australia now exports $2.8 billion worth of wine each year. There has been an increase in value as well as volume, as far as wine exports are concerned, going out of the electorates of the member for Barker, the member for Riverina, the member for Mallee and the member for Forrest in Western Australia. Exports continue to grow.We understand that, in the agricultural industry, there is pressure on some of the wine grape growers across Australia. I am aware that the member for Barker and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry visited some of the growers in the member for Barker's electorate recently to talk about this issue. One of the things that we can do to relieve the pressure on wine grape growers is to increase our exports, to increase the pull-through of the product internationally to markets across the world. We are doing that in multilateral and bilateral negotiations. Wine tariff reductions across the world have been a very important target in our government's negotiations.Of course, in the current WTO round there is the opportunity to eliminate all export subsidies in our competition in the international marketplace. That will make Australian wine more competitive in the international marketplace. We are also arguing to cut tariffs, on a multilateral basis, on our wine going into many markets across the world. We have already achieved that in a number of our free trade agreements that have concluded; for example, under the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement, we have seen significant and ongoing reductions in the tariffs on Australian wine going into that market. All importantly, one of the great supporters of the Australia-United States free trade agreement is the great Australian wine industry, because it has seen significant improvements in market access to that growing market in the United States. Australia almost dominates as an exporter into that US market.One of our objectives in negotiations with China in the Australia-China free trade agreement is to further reduce tariffs on imported wine into China. We achieved a certain amount there. After China's accession to the WTO, it came right down to about 16 per cent. Our target is to get that down even lower bilaterally in the interests of the great Australian wine industry. All those efforts - as well as the broader suite of reforms that the government is introducing, particularly workplace relations reforms - are helping to strengthen the ability of the Australian wine industry not only to grow at home but also to compete better in the international marketplace.</DOC>

 - I stand by everything I said on the Channel 10 program. As for the projections made by the NRMA, my recall is that that was based upon the most recent spike in world oil prices produced by the mishap at the BP installation in Alaska. It is easy for people in the situation of the NRMA and, indeed, of many other organisations to alarm people with projections. We are all painfully aware that world oil prices are pushing up the cost of petrol at the bowser. Those in the community who peddle simplistic solutions - and, incidentally, I do not include the NRMA in that description, but there are others - are only serving to make a difficult situation for our fellow Australians more difficult.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. After all, I think he has the world's second largest uranium mine in his electorate. With the expansion of that mine, it will eventually overtake in size the Canadian mine, which is currently the largest. I know that the honourable member has been a great supporter of the Roxby Downs project. Next year will be the 30th anniversary of the Australian nuclear safeguards policy. This policy, introduced by the Fraser government in 1977, has been a great success. Under this policy, Australian uranium can be used only for peaceful purposes. It must be subject to the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Australian uranium must be protected under the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials. In 2005 we made an amendment to the policy under which IAEA additional protocols allowing access at short notice at any location would be a condition of the new supply of uranium to non-nuclear weapons states. Australia has a very solid nuclear safeguards policy. As an IAEA board member, we have been one of the main advocates of IAEA activities, including most recently in relation to Iran.I was asked whether I was aware of any concerns about Australia's policy. I had not been aware until the Leader of the Opposition announced that he was doing a backflip on Labor's so-called three mines policy - a policy that he did not think was in need of change a few weeks ago and suddenly he decided, for reasons of his own, that it had to be changed.What is interesting about the statement that the Leader of the Opposition made was that he was going to introduce three specific strict new measures to Australian exports of uranium. What this revealed was that the Leader of the Opposition simply had not done any homework and did not know what the existing policy was. He said that we should only export to NPT states. Well, we do only export to NPT states. That is a longstanding Australian government policy. He said that he promised the strictest safeguards in the world. We already have the strictest safeguards, and I think it holds Australia in very good stead that we do. Thirdly and most interestingly, he said he wanted a diplomatic initiative which would bring together -  - countries involved in the uranium fuel cycle. Since 1978 Australia has been a leading member of precisely such an organisation - the Nuclear Suppliers Group. What is interesting about the Leader of the Opposition is that this is once more a revelation of the character of the man. He makes a backflip because, of course, he is weak and he has not done his homework; he does not know what the existing policy is. For those people in the Labor Party caucus who are well-known champions of the three mines policy and run the old uranium scare campaigns, which are very much out of the 1960s and the 1970s, the Leader of the Opposition, in wanting to change the three mines policy, offers them his three point sop, which is to embrace the government's existing policies.

 - Do I agree that there are no quick fixes to petrol prices, which are rising because of world oil prices? Yes, I do agree. Do I believe that a stunt like signing a letter would bring petrol prices down? No, I do not. It reminds me of the last federal election. What needed to be done by the Labor Party for interest rates? Sign a blank cheque. Why don't you write a letter 'To whom it may concern' - the President of Iran, the President of Iraq or the President of Russia - 'Please bring the world oil price down.' Can I say - and Australians know it and the Leader of the Opposition just implied it with his previous questions - that petrol prices at the bowser in Australia are principally determined by the world oil price. - The second significant factor in petrol prices is the taxation regime. The reason why Australia has the third lowest petrol prices in the OECD is that we have the third lowest taxation regime in the OECD. Let me repeat, as I did yesterday: the ACCC, on a daily basis, monitor 3,500 retail sites across all the metropolitan capitals and 110 in country towns. When they find any evidence of price fixing, they bring proceedings, including in relation to Ballarat recently, where a case in respect of price fixing has gone to the full Federal Court and fines of $20 million were imposed. Petrol prices are of concern to Australian families, and they are of so much concern to Australian families that they will not be helped by stunts like the member for Hunter's.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. As I have often heard the member for Mackellar say, people who help build our country in their prime deserve to be looked after in their declining years. - The Howard government has massively increased spending on aged care facilities, from just $3 billion in 1996 to almost $8 billion in the current year. Since 1996 there are some 31,000 more residential aged care places, and since 1996 there are some 32,000 more community aged care places. That is a 40 per cent plus increase, and there will be a further 26,000 additional places over the next three years.The government is working with the states to avoid having nursing home patients filling public hospital beds. The Transition Care Program will help 13,000 older people a year to leave hospitals for more appropriate care, and the Pathways Home Program gives the states $254 million for rehabilitation and step-down services. In hailing some of these new programs, the Premier of New South Wales, Morris Iemma, said after COAG:... we've made significant progress on tackling some of the blockages in our health system. The Prime Minister's mentioned the elderly awaiting placement in nursing home ... These are significant agreements that will ... provide for sustained improvement in the quality of services in our hospitals ...That is what Premier Iemma said. But the member for Lalor must have been out for lunch when these announcements were being made, because she is now claiming some deficiencies as an excuse to revive, yet again, our old friend Medicare Gold, the policy she will not let die. It is the Labor policy that won an election - for the coalition! The Leader of the Opposition keeps killing it, and the member for Lalor keeps reviving it. It is a bit like the three mines policy: the Leader of the Opposition keeps killing it, and the member for Grayndler keeps reviving it. But he is a very strong leader! Let me say this to the member for Lalor: 1,000 complaints do not constitute a policy, and 100 opinions do not constitute a principle. On the evidence so far, at least in health, Labor has no policies, no principles and absolutely no hope of winning an election. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question, because -  - I am aware of a report which the member for Perth referred to this morning by the Workplace Rights Advocate about this particular AWA. An interesting part of this report is that the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate, appointed by the Victorian Labor government, says in his report that, for reasons that he sets out, he is referring this complaint to the Office of Workplace Services -  - which the Leader of the Opposition described in this place yesterday as 'snivelling liars'. The Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate is referring this matter to that very same Office of Workplace Services. This is an indictment on the Leader of the Opposition and the ALP for his disgraceful, cowardly and slanderous comments that he made yesterday. - This report reveals two things. One is that, yes, there is a reduction in the base rate of pay of up to four per cent. But what the member for Perth failed to reveal in his question - as we have heard from him in the past - is that there is also a bonus system introduced under this arrangement, a bonus system that returns up to 16 per cent per annum. -  - If the member for Perth was prepared to come in here and tell the whole truth about this matter, he would have also revealed that there is up to a net 12 per cent increase for workers under this particular arrangement. The member for Perth has form. He came in here earlier in the year in relation to an agreement with Esselte and failed to disclose the full terms of that agreement, which, when investigated, revealed something else. - We have the ACTU running misleading and deceptive advertisements which, when investigated by the Office of Workplace Services, are shown to be wrong, are shown to be misleading and deceptive. And he is up to the same old tricks once again here in the House today. I say to members of the House and I say to the Australian public: whenever you hear an allegation, whether it is from the member for Perth or the Leader of the Opposition or the ACTU, you cannot take it on face value because, even on what he said today, he has failed to tell the whole truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question about the construction of three air warfare destroyers in South Australia - a $6 billion investment which is important to the economic development of South Australia and essential to the defence and future protection of Australia. Last week I opened the Air Warfare Destroyer System Centre in Adelaide, along with the Minister for Finance and Administration. This centre now houses 200 Australians who are employed across naval architecture, maritime engineering, and major project and financial management. It houses not only the Defence Materiel Organisation but also the Australian Submarine Corporation, which has been chosen to build the air warfare destroyers. Raytheon is going to install the Aegis combat system into these ships which, amongst other things, will be able to detect, track and intercept missiles and other objects at a distance of up to 150 kilometres.It is very important also for the people of Wakefield and right across South Australia to appreciate that another 1,000 South Australians will be employed in this project - everything from boilermakers to high-end engineering. Another 1,000 Australians will be employed in other parts of Australia in not only shipbuilding yards but other places of manufacturing, design and development. The government mid-year next year will make a decision between one of two designs. The two that we are looking at are the Spanish Navantia F100 or the evolved Gibbs and Cox design, as they are called. These ships will carry missiles and helicopters and will be able to cruise significant distances from Australia - indeed, up to 6,000 nautical miles.It is also important to appreciate that these air warfare destroyers will play an important role in protecting the two amphibious ships that the government has also commissioned - another $2 billion investment. They will provide close protection of those ships and surface and air defence for our soldiers on those ships, once they go to land. It is also important that Australians appreciate - and Australians recently had significant reason to pause at the Taepodong 2 missile launched by the North Koreans - that these air warfare destroyers will give us the capability, if we choose to go down this path, of having an antiballistic missile capability.This project is nation protecting and nation building. It is about making sure that we have a good, strong maritime capability in our region and throughout the world and also, at the same time, about investing Australian resources in seeing that Australians build Australian warfare destroyers of which they will be justifiably very proud.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the honourable member's question is no. If the honourable member had cared to even look, for example, at the report of the Victorian government official into this he would have seen what they stand to gain. The official, I again remind the House, saw fit to refer it to what the Leader of the Opposition referred to yesterday as 'snivelling liars' - namely, the Office of Workplace Services - in his cowardly defamation of them yesterday. That is what it was: cowardly defamation. If the honourable member opposite had cared to look at the full details of the report, he would have seen, as a result of this agreement, that those workers stand to achieve a net gain of 12 per cent under these agreements.The other thing which was not revealed by either of the gentlemen asking these questions is that, on my advice, there are some 500 collective agreements - half of which have been negotiated by unions in Australia and contain clauses in relation to bonus payments such as are contained in this particular agreement. It has been good enough for union officials in Australia to negotiate collective agreements in the past which contain bonus clauses but apparently it is not good enough in relation to this particular agreement. What hypocrisy!</DOC>

 - I am pleased to be able to confirm that the government has delivered on its promise to fund new projects under the Working Together to Manage Emergencies initiative. In relation to the assiduous work of the member for Macquarie, who is very much aware of the significant risks that bushfire in particular poses to a community close to our urban centres, the Hawkesbury City Council received more than $25,000 to replace the bulk water storage facility used by its Rural Fire Service, and that I think is a very important initiative for the electorate of Macquarie.I might also note that the electorate of Macquarie received about $150,000 in the previous funding round for local councils and rural fire services. I was pleased to see amongst those a grant for Mount Wilson, a place I had the pleasure of visiting in my youth and know well. This initiative involves a collaborative approach with communities -  -  - I am pleased to see how interested the opposition is in these matters that might impact upon their electorates! We have funded in the order of 365 new projects valued at $13.1 million under this program. They cover rural, remote and urban electorates across Australia. They help communities with emergency water storage, developing emergency response plans, flood mitigation, training equipment for rural fire brigades and the installation of emergency lighting at regional airstrips as well as the purchase of satellite phones.Volunteers in all of our electorates play a vital role in assisting in emergencies and disasters. This is the second full year of funding under this initiative. There has been overwhelming support from the emergency services area. I might remind members - particularly members of the opposition, who do not seem very concerned about these matters - that applications for the next funding round will open in December, and members who are assiduous in representing the interests of their electorates may well be able to follow up on those.</DOC>

 - I was informed that Mr Andrews had decided to do an interview for the Lateline program on the afternoon before the interview took place on 2 June. The ABC approached Mr Andrews directly, before it knew of his appearance before the coronial inquest into the deaths of three young petrol sniffers. As is made clear in Mr Andrews's own public statement, the decision to appear was made by him alone. It is simply not true to suggest that Mr Andrews appeared at my request. Mr Andrews was speaking about these issues while he was still working at Mutitjulu, most particularly during the Northern Territory coronial inquest into the petrol-sniffing deaths in August last year.I was informed that Mr Andrews had decided that he would only appear anonymously as he had already experienced a number of threats, particularly at one time when his wife was pregnant, and, as a result, he had previously withdrawn testimony that he had given to the coronial inquest because he felt fearful. The reason he undertook to appear on Lateline is that he is concerned for the community of Mutitjulu. He had important evidence to provide. He was not the only person to provide that evidence. I would say to many of those that sit opposite that, rather than attempting to attack a person who is trying to uncover very serious issues, they should -  - I am advised that he consulted with the departmental executive to ensure that his appearance on Lateline would not contravene the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct. Mr Speaker, I suggest that people read Mr Andrews's own statement about his reasons for appearing. I especially commend to you his suggestion that those attacking the Lateline program should channel their energy into protecting the women and the children who have been subject to the vilifying claims that Aboriginal women, doctors and health workers all made independently on the Lateline program. Unfortunately, these are disgraceful circumstances to have occurred in Australia's community. It would do us all well to try to protect those who are trying to protect the most vulnerable in our society - not to throw stones at those who would put their own families at risk, as they believe, but to protect them and not damage whistleblowers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can inform him that today's labour force survey showed that unemployment has fallen further from 30-year record lows. It has fallen from 4.9 per cent in June to 4.8 per cent in July, a position that Australia has not been in for over 30 years. There was a solid rise in employment, with 50,700 new jobs in July - although, as the ABS indicates, some of that could have been generated by the training of temporary staff for the August 2006 census. This is to be added to the increase in jobs in both June and May, meaning that, over the last year, 219,000 jobs have been created in Australia - and, under this government, 1.9 million new jobs have been created. In addition to that, the participation rate rose to 65 per cent in July, which is a new record high. Putting those things together, the participation rate is higher than it has ever been before, yet unemployment is now at a 30-year low.Can I also indicate to the House an interesting statistic. Since Work Choices was introduced in March, 159,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. The Labor Party predicted there would be mass sackings and that the world as we know it would end. - 'What rubbish!' he says. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, some of us have a memory that lasts longer than 24 hours. We remember all of the doom and gloom which the Leader of the Opposition forecast in relation to Work Choices. He was wrong about that. There is no evidence whatsoever that Work Choices has led to doom or gloom - in fact, quite to the contrary. I should mention for the benefit of the member for Bass that unemployment in the seat of Bass was 11.1 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the relevant minister. It is now 5.4 per cent - double as good as it was under the Labor Party - because of the economic reforms which this government has put in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I note at the outset that in the 138 days since Work Choices has been in operation 159,000 jobs have been created in Australia. That is an average of more than 1,000 jobs per day - something which the member for Deakin and I are very proud of. Despite this creation of jobs and a record low unemployment rate of 4.8 per cent, we continue to have a misleading and deceptive campaign by the ACTU and the ALP about Work Choices.The latest of these cases in which they have been caught red-handed with misleading information involved, as the member for Deakin asked me about, employees at Lufthansa. Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU - and I remind the House that Sharan Burrow was the woman who, at the outset of this misleading campaign, made the infamous comment that it would be desirable to have the grieving family of a dead or injured worker to help their campaign; that is what Ms Burrow said at the start of this campaign and that set the tone for everything that has followed since in a misleading campaign - said yesterday about this matter at Lufthansa that the employees were denied the right of union representation. She said, and I quote from the transcript of her interview, 'And refused point-blank when they asked for the union to be involved.'This was what was peddled by the President of the ACTU yesterday, and it is simply plain wrong. The very respected legal firm Blake Dawson Waldron, one of the most respected legal firms in Australia, wrote to the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate in relation to this matter. - I quote from part of the letter written by Blakes, one of the most respected law firms in Australia, to the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate:The complaint investigated by you is not one made by an employee of GTS. No employee has sought to appoint the ASU - the Australian Services Union - as a bargaining agent in relation to an AWA. No employee has complained to you that the operation of an AWA has adversely affected them.So much for the false information from the President of the ACTU that the unions were denied involvement. Indeed, Blakes go on to say:There is questionable legitimacy in a complaint which is divorced from the opinions of employees who have the opportunity of agreeing or not agreeing to the terms of the AWA. - Mr Speaker, I table that letter from Blake Dawson Waldron. Beyond this, we have the hypocrisy of the ACTU - Mr Combet in particular and the member for Perth and others from the Labor Party - on the matter of penalty rates, because the member for Perth was saying, 'Isn't this a disaster that there is some trading of penalty rates going on in relation to this particular matter.' Trading of penalty rates is hardly new. Indeed, let me read you a quote:Who do you think might have said that? Who was it that negotiated these changes in penalty rates? None other than the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet himself. So Mr Combet is on record as saying he has been personally involved in the negotiation in relation to penalty rates, and yet the member for Perth comes in here yesterday and says, 'Isn't this a disaster that there was a negotiation of penalty rates.' What is most bizarre about this particular case and this allegation is that the Australian Labor Party, once the party of workers in Australia, is actually standing in the way of employees at this particular business achieving a 12 to 13 per cent increase in their wages.So we have got to the bizarre situation in the ACTU campaign that the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, if they had their way, would actually deny workers a 12 to 13 per cent increase in their wages. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition is so opposed to Australian workplace agreements? Why is it that he wants to rip them up when they can lead to desirable outcomes for workers, such as a 12 or 13 per cent increase in their wages? It can only be because of the vested interests of the union movement, who are ideologically opposed to Australian workplace agreements. I began this answer by recounting the fact that 159,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the last 138 days. There is no doubt about which parties represent the workers in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. If the proposition advanced by the member for Perth were correct, the reality would be that workers would not be taking up these AWAs. -  - The workers at this particular business have a choice of taking this AWA or remaining on their collective agreement. - So what we have here is another indication from the member for Perth and the Australian Labor Party that individual Australian workers should not have the opportunity to make a choice for an industrial instrument -  - that will make them better off. As I said earlier, this is the bizarre and twisted situation which the Labor Party has got itself into: it wants to rip up an industrial instrument that enables tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australian workers to actually be better off and to make a choice for that. But on top of that, if there was something so bad about these particular provisions, I am trying to remember when I heard a complaint from the member for Perth about, for example, the CFMEU and Dunlop Bedding Victoria enterprise bargaining agreement 2005 -  - which contains similar provisions to those in the Lufthansa agreement. Did I hear anything? Did anybody hear anything from the member for Perth about an agreement negotiated by the CFMEU which contains like conditions? No, nothing whatsoever. This again exposes the total hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this subject.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and for his interest. I also add to your words, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs; I am delighted to have him in Canberra today.The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI, celebrated its third anniversary in July. I think it is fair to say that, with the strong participation of New Zealand and Pacific Island countries, it has done a great deal to help Solomon Islanders put their lives back together again after the ethnic conflict that essentially brought the country to a halt. There is no doubt that RAMSI enjoys very strong public support in the Solomon Islands; perhaps not all politicians support it or appreciate it but certainly the general public in the Solomon Islands are enormously supportive.The Solomon Islands government now, after the upheaval of a few months ago, appears to be stable, and our expectation is that that will continue. The recent Foreign Investment Act has made the Solomon Islands a more attractive destination for investment, with palm oil and goldmining well on the way to restarting, but there still is a very long way to go. For example, we have some concerns about a commission of inquiry into the April Honiara riots, to be led by Mr Marcus Einfeld QC. We are particularly concerned that some of the terms of reference could interfere with the independence of the Solomon Islands judiciary and may impact on current court proceedings in relation to the riots. For example, a review of the arrests, charges and detention of two MPs, Messrs Dausabea and Ne'e, relates directly to the independent decision of a magistrate of the Solomon Islands judiciary.I note that the Solomon Islands legal profession is also concerned about the terms of reference. The Attorney-General has challenged two of the terms of reference in the Solomon Islands High Court and one of the commissioners has resigned because of these concerns. I mention this simply to underline the fact that there is still a long way to go in the Solomon Islands. We should not just be complacent that RAMSI is there; the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police have done a wonderful job. The media have withdrawn from the Solomon Islands so we do not hear about it anymore, but we remain extremely focused on it and there are still some concerns about activities taking place in that country.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the honourable member's question is no. What the honourable member for Perth is arguing is that there should be no choice between an AWA or a collective agreement. What this company has offered is a choice between an AWA or a collective agreement. Those workers who choose not to take the AWA remain on the collective agreement, and that was pointed out in advice from the company to the Victorian Workplace Advocate. The member for Perth knows that very well. Why is it -  - Do not get too excited, Stephen. The reality is that the Labor Party do not like Australian workplace agreements because they give workers choice and they give them the opportunity to earn more money. Why is it that the once great party of the Australian worker is abandoning the worker today?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. He has a very strong commitment to the global war against terror. The Prime Minister yesterday, on behalf of the government, formally announced that Australia will send another 150 Australian troops to Afghanistan, bringing to 400 those who will be working with the Dutch, NATO and other forces in Afghanistan to assist the democratically elected Afghanistan government in dealing with significant political, economic, social and military challenges.It is important that, as Australians, we appreciate that our contribution to this is not just about supporting the Afghanistan government but also about upholding our responsibilities to be a part of the solution in relation to global terror. Australians, and too many Australian families, have been touched, if not scarred, in this decade by two Bali bombings and by the bombing of our embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. And we have seen other evidence of terrorist activity in our region.There are a number of links between those who planned and committed these heinous crimes and Afghanistan. Samudra, who was sentenced to death for plotting the Bali bombing, testified during his trial that he had fought in Afghanistan in the 1990s, alongside Osama bin Laden. He also testified that it was his duty as a true Muslim to wage jihad against the West. The International Crisis Group in our region is headed by Sidney Jones - the respected and pre-eminent expert in Indonesian terrorism. A 2003 document to the International Crisis Group on Jemaah Islamiah in South-East Asia documented the relationship between those who trained in Afghanistan and terrorist activity in our region. Zulkarnaen, for example, who trained in Afghanistan in 1985, was a senior military commander of JI. Muklas, who was sentenced to death for the Bali bombing, trained there in 1986. Hambali, who is JI's chief strategist and primary link between JI and al-Qaeda, also trained there in 1987.Dr Zachary Abuza, who is head of the Department of the Political Science and International Relations at Simmons College, in a paper that was published in 2002 looking at Hambali and the relationship between those who trained in Afghanistan and global terrorism, said:One cannot underestimate how important the Afghan connection is.It is, he says, the basis for the al-Qaeda network throughout the world. It is extremely important for us as Australians to appreciate, particularly when five per cent of the Australian population is overseas at any one time, that the defence and security of our country, our people, our interests and our values is not just about our borders, nor indeed our region. It is about ensuring that we make a contribution, along with others, to demonstrate what the Australian newspaper describes as 'moral musculature' in taking up the struggle against global terrorism. There is no greater source of it than Afghanistan. We have responsibilities in this area. We are very proud of the Australian Defence Force, what it is doing and what it is about to do on our behalf and on behalf of the next generation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. Of course the member for Riverina knows only too well that it is just as important that we continue to invest in critical infrastructure across regional Australia to support our exporters as it is to open up new opportunities in export markets for them, whether it be the wheat growers in her electorate of Riverina or the manufacturing exporters like Celair-Malmet or Precision Parts that are doing very well. They are in regional Australia, and we support them. We support their efforts of competing across the world and providing jobs in those regions in the export industries.This year we have committed a significant amount of money to invest in infrastructure across Australia, particularly in regional Australia, through our AusLink program, in adding to the already successful AusLink program and in building it to a $15 billion investment in roads across Australia. But we have also announced a significant investment in communications infrastructure to underpin the need for modern communications across regional Australia as well as in the metropolitan areas. I instance the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package that we announced. It had two components: the $1.1 billion investment for services such as Broadband Connect to help fill in those gaps, particularly across regional Australia; and the $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund, which is going to provide the safety net for regional Australia for years to come. - I will come to that in a minute. So, where the market fails to provide new technology, there is going to be a guaranteed source of revenue to provide that technology in regional Australia for industries like those in the member for Riverina's electorate.It is well known that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to these two lots of investment in infrastructure in regional Australia. Firstly, he referred to the Roads to Recovery program as a boondoggle. In this year's budget we have added another $307 million to local authorities through the Roads to Recovery program, and I bet that the local authorities in the member for Brand's electorate take the money and want to keep it. They would not want it taken back and they would not believe it is a boondoggle. The Leader of the Opposition described the Connect Australia package as a National Party slush fund. I wonder if the member for Capricornia thinks it is a National Party slush fund when it helps her constituents get better communication services. People in country Australia do not believe, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that it is unnecessary and trivial. They do no believe that the Roads to Recovery program is a boondoggle. They believe that the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary and trivial.</DOC>

 - I welcome this resort by the member for Lilley to American and British analogies. I am reminded, in the context of industrial relations, of that immortal injunction of Tony Blair's that fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. I am fascinated that the member for Lilley wants this government to embrace the economic policies of the current United States administration. I wonder if the member for Lilley would like us to embrace, as one of his predecessors did -  - I wonder if they would like us to have a look at the capital gains tax on the family home that exists, subject to certain thresholds, in both Britain and the United States. When he asked me that question, I was reminded of that great Labor campaign in 1980, when Peter Walsh raised the possibility of having a capital gains tax on the family home. If the opposition wants - The member for Lilley then left the chamber. - If the Labor Party wants to start advocating American housing policies, including a capital gains tax on the family home, this government will be very happy to oblige the member for Lilley and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition. Of course interest rates in the United States have been lower than they have been in Australia; that is obvious. The reason is that the United States economy was flattened a few years ago by adverse economic developments. The reason the Australian economy was not flattened is that this government managed the Australian economy better than the American administration did the American economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I thank him for the passion and commitment that he brings to all of these health issues based on his long experience as a medical practitioner in the suburbs of Perth. I regret to say that cancer will afflict one in three Australian males and one in four Australian females before the age of 75, but the good news is that Australian cancer survival rates are the second highest in the world and that our cancer survival rates have increased by 14 per cent over the last 20 years.Bowel cancer, I regret to say, currently kills about 5,000 Australians a year, but the good news is that it is relatively easy to treat and cure if it is detected early. Over the next two years, everyone turning 55 and 65 - more than one million people - will be offered bowel cancer screening as the first stage of the government's national bowel cancer screening program. The first test kits went out in the mail this week in Queensland. Test kits will be going out in New South Wales from next week and test kits will be going out in Victoria from next month. I say to the Australian people: if you do have the chance to be screened, take it because it could save your life. It is estimated that, of the 25,000 people who participated in the trial program, some 20 lives were saved. Finally, I would like to thank the states and territories for their cooperation in establishing this important new national program.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the full contribution from BIS Shrapnel, but I certainly agree that one of the problems this country faces at present is a shortage of skilled tradesmen. I agree with that. The government recognised that at the time of the last election. - The most significant policy in the last election, dealing with the issue of skills, was the commitment by the government to establish Australian technical colleges. I am very pleased to inform the House that 20 of the 25 technical colleges will be up and running by the beginning of next year. - I remind the parliament and I remind the member for Jagajaga in particular of an interview on 8 August 2006 - it is very contemporary. It was an interview with Michael Costa, who is a senior minister in the New South Wales government. The intro from the ABC presenter said:After 11 years of Labor government, the Treasurer is happy to admit to other failures.Michael Costa: We failed to keep our apprentice numbers up - partly that was due to, you know, the focus on the balance sheet, the need to look at cost-cutting strategies - and unfortunately, it seems that apprenticeships was an easy one.In other words, what that does is implicate the states. The member for Jagajaga talks to me about the investment of this government in skills. Let me remind the member for Jagajaga that we now have 389,000 apprentices and trainees in training. That represents a 151 per cent increase since March 1996. We are providing 167,000 additional places between 2005 and 2008. By contrast, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in 1993 there were only 123,000 apprentices in training. - I remind those opposite that, since 1995-96, the Australian government VTE funding has increased by 85 per cent in real terms. Unmet demand for VTE - vocational training and education - places has halved. In other words, the allegation that this government has cut funding for skills training is absolutely incorrect.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question because he raises a very important question and Australians ought to be informed. It is important in the context of the conflict in the Middle East, in particular. Many in our community have strong ties to Lebanon and Israel. We understand that people are legitimately concerned about family and friends, but I would urge caution if people plan to join in the conflict or send funds to assist.While it is unlikely to be an offence if people join or are conscripted into the defence forces of recognised governments, the same cannot be said for engagement or involvement in Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a multifaceted organisation. It has political, social and military components. There is one element, Hezbollah's External Security Organisation, that has been listed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government since 2003. The External Security Organisation is a distinct terrorist wing of Hezbollah and has been responsible for attacks dating back to the 1980s. It is assessed as continuing to prepare, plan and foster acts involving threats to human life and serious damage to property. The military wing of Hezbollah, referred to as Islamic Resistance, is not proscribed, nor are the political or social components.So Australians who engage with or provide support to the External Security Organisation might be committing a terrorist offence under the Criminal Code and, equally, under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. But under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act it is an offence to enter a foreign state with the intent to engage in hostilities or to engage in hostile activities in a foreign state. The foreign incursion offence does not apply if a person is with the armed forces of a government, and that would mean it would not apply in relation to Israeli or Lebanese defence forces. However, Australians who engage in hostile activities with the Hezbollah military wing or the External Security Organisation could well be committing an offence.The whole of Hezbollah is listed for the purposes of our asset-freezing legislation, and it is an offence under the Charter of the United Nations Act to deal with its assets or to make assets available to it. I think this is a very important matter, which Australians who are thinking of dealing with Hezbollah in any way, shape or form should have regard to, because, as I have outlined, there is the potential for serious criminal acts to be committed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He represents two important Australian ports - Gladstone, which is one of the big-volume ports in Australia, and Bundaberg, which receives a large number of international recreational vessels as the first port of call - so he has a particular interest in the performance of our ports and in ensuring that our trade flows freely through those ports. - The reality is, of course, that it is very important for Australia to have a smoothly working port system. The BTRE, the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics, is about to release a report in which it forecasts that the volume of non-container trade to pass through our ports in Australia will grow from 0.6 billion tonnes this year to 1.4 billion tonnes in 20 years time. A big proportion of that will be going through ports like Gladstone. In addition, it is forecast that there will be an even bigger increase, a 5.4 per cent per annum increase, over the next 20 years in the movement of containers, from 5.2 million 20-foot equivalent unit containers this year to 14.9 million TEUs in 2024 - virtually a threefold increase.When you think back to 1996, the rate of moving these containers across the port was stuck on 14, 15 or 16 containers an hour. In fact, when the Labor Party were last in office they told us that it was physically impossible to move them at a faster rate than 17 containers an hour - that was the absolute maximum rate that could be reached. Of course, we are now well over 27 containers an hour and doing very much better. - Imagine what a crisis we would have in this country if we were trying to move 15 million TEUs a year with crane movement rates. How could we possibly get the freight across the ports if we were still operating our container terminals at the rate that Labor said was the maximum that could be achieved? The reality is that this government has made substantial reforms to facilitate trade, to get our ports working better. The bad news, of course, is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to roll back industrial relations reform. He wants to go back to 1996 and presumably 1996 container-handling rates, and that will bring our country to a standstill. Our trade will stop. Those are the kinds of policies that Labor is trying to put before the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question and lament his recent announcement that he will not be joining us again in this place after the next election. He has made a fine contribution on behalf of Western Australia, particularly in the resources area.The cornerstone of the Howard government's support of business innovation is very much the R&amp;D tax concession program, a market driven program that responds directly to the needs of industry. We now have almost 6,000 Australian businesses, 90 per cent of them SMEs, registered for the concession. That is an increase of some 52 per cent in the last five years. That is no accident, and it is also no accident that business expenditure now is at record levels, reaching $7.2 billion in 2004 according to the latest ABS study.Innovation is a critical part of our competitiveness for Australian industry. As I go around Australia as part of my preparation for the industry statement I will be discussing the issue of how we can further assist industry with innovation. Our international competitors are not standing still in this area, and neither can we. If we want to talk about people standing still, there is the opportunity to consider what is happening on the other side of this chamber in terms of policies or attempted policies that have recently been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. In raising for the Labor Party what he called the Innovation Blueprint, the Leader of the Opposition said that he was very attracted to the scrapping of the R&amp;D concession in favour of loans and grant schemes.Judging by the reaction from industry, people there are not quite so sure that the Leader of the Opposition has any idea about innovation. In fact, some of the responses that we received, particularly from industry bodies, are worth recalling. The AiG's Heather Ridout said that the proposal would mean that 'a board - or the government for that matter - decides what programs get up, but that under a tax concession it is a market driven scheme, which is far more accessible'. The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies said that scrapping of the tax concession would do 'more damage than good'. And R&amp;D tax experts from firms like KPMG and PwC describe the proposal as 'retrograde', 'unfortunate', sending the 'wrong message', creating a 'grant mentality amongst companies', 'picking winners' and being 'costly and time consuming'.What we have here is obvious opposition from industry but obvious lack of understanding of innovation and innovation policy by the Leader of the Opposition. It is no coincidence then that he has gone completely silent on this area as his reheated 'noodle nation' becomes limp and soggy. It was a poor attempt at policy which exposed the Leader of the Opposition for not only being a weak leader but also having no idea on innovation, no idea on industry and no idea to help either.</DOC>

I am also aware that there are still a number of taxation aspects that need to be resolved. They are in hand. I had a meeting with some people concerned in relation to this issue. Of course, the actual determination of the entitlements has something to do with the roles and responsibilities of the New South Wales government, as I think the honourable member for New England would be aware. - I cannot quite pick that up.

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and acknowledge his keen interest in education in his electorate. The Australian government's $1 billion Investing in Our Schools program is designed to provide funding for smaller scale projects for necessary infrastructure for schools. This program has become necessary because of the chronic neglect by state Labor governments of state government schools.There are state government schools that have been waiting years for some of the most basic amenities to be funded. To put it in context, there are about 6,900 state government schools across Australia. Just in the first two rounds - rounds 1 and 2 - of the Investing in Our Schools program there have been over 8,000 applications for funding from the federal government for state government schools. In round 3 there are now 10,000 applications from state government schools to the federal government. That is almost three applications per government school - per state government school - to the Australian government.The sorts of projects for which they are seeking funding are things like fixing up vermin infested sports sheds, fixing up threadbare carpets and fixing up canteens that have failed to meet state government health department standards, yet state governments are doing nothing to invest in their schools. You would have thought that perhaps the state Labor governments would be shamed into doing something about it but, according to the Sunday Telegraph of 9 July, the New South Wales state government will spend more money on buying new cars for public servants than on upgrading schools this financial year. You would think that members opposite would be slamming the state Labor governments for failing to properly invest in state government schools. - But, no, the members opposite -  - are complaining to the coalition about funding for state government schools. The member for Charlton wrote to us about sports facilities in a government school in her electorate. She said:The current facilities are inadequate, impractical and unsafe ...This is in a state government school. So under round 1 of the Investing in Our Schools program the Howard government provided the $50,000. The member for Chifley wrote to us about a lack of air conditioning in a school in his electorate, a state government school. He said:This is having an adverse effect on students' health and their ability to concentrate.He goes on:The students inform me they suffer headaches, dehydration, nosebleeds as a result of the school's lack of airconditioning.This is in a state government school. Did he write to the state government? No, he wrote to the Howard government, and we funded it under round 2 - $118,000. - The member for Chisholm has written to me recently about problems caused by flooding because of a leaking roof in a state government school in her electorate.The member for Chisholm then left the chamber. - But the member for Ballarat takes the cake. She is going around her electorate claiming credit for the shambles that the state -  -  -  - But the member for Ballarat takes the cake. In her newsletter to her electorate, she lists a number -  -  -  - I table the very public letter to some 80,000 voters in the member for Ballarat's electorate and, in tabling it, I point out that in this newsletter she claims credit for the $4.3 million in funding that has been directed to the Ballarat electorate for state government schools. - And nowhere in this newsletter is there any mention of the fact that this is Australian government funding under the Investing in Our Schools program for state government schools. - Members opposite ought to be ashamed of the fact that they do not publicly denounce state Labor governments across this country for failing to invest in their schools. - The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Mitchell. It is the second question he has asked me about this issue in a couple of weeks, and I appreciate his interest. The government welcomes Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed through the Security Council a few days ago, calling for the full cessation of hostilities followed by the deployment of Lebanese government and UNIFIL - United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon - forces in southern Lebanon and parallel withdrawal by the Israeli forces. The resolution authorises an increase in strength of UNIFIL to 15,000. Those troops will no doubt largely come from Mediterranean countries, and perhaps from some South-East Asian countries, to support 15,000 Lebanese troops which the Lebanese government has said it will deploy in southern Lebanon.I note that the cessation of hostilities is due to enter into force in about one hour's time, at 3 pm our time. The Israelis have agreed to a cessation of hostilities and Hezbollah has indicated that it does as well, but, for this resolution to succeed, there must be full and complete implementation. The government has no illusions that this will be very difficult. We do not know the extent to which Hezbollah will cease hostilities immediately. It said it reserves the right to attack Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. We do not know the extent to which the Lebanese Army will be capable of fulfilling Lebanon's obligations, not only under this Security Council resolution but under the previous Security Council resolution, 1559. We know that UNIFIL, the United Nations force in Lebanon, does not have the authority to disarm Hezbollah and this is, after all, a chapter VI, not a chapter VII, resolution. We know that the Lebanese cabinet is still divided and has yet to resolve its divisions on the issue of disarming Hezbollah, and we hope it will make a positive decision to support the disarmament of Hezbollah soon.I mention all of these things because these are unanswered questions. Positive answers to these questions are fundamental to the successful implementation of this resolution. There are a lot of ifs and a lot of buts about the resolution, and it remains unclear as to whether it will be effective, but let me say finally that there are two countries in particular that we would hope would strongly support this resolution. One of those countries is Syria, and the other is Iran. We would hope that Iran would take a more responsible position and start to support a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict as well, something that Iran has not done up until now. Until all countries and organisations in the region support a two-state solution, there will not be peace in the Middle East.</DOC>

 - It is obvious to everybody that the Inspector of Transport Security is a part-time position. He will be called in to undertake particular responsibilities as required. He is not, as the Leader of the Opposition and sometimes the member for Brisbane have tried to pretend, some kind of 'el supremo' who is in charge of all airport security in Australia. That is the job of the Office of Transport Security. It has several hundred staff, supported by the AFP, Customs, Quarantine, security authorities and, of course, the various employees of the particular airport. It is not his role to take on some particular oversight of all of the transport security arrangements in Australia. His task is to undertake specific inquiries on a no-blame basis into issues for which he has been commissioned by the government, and he is currently undertaking an inquiry into surface transport. That work is being done in cooperation with the state authorities and others who have a particular responsibility in that area.Let me also add that the legislation to underpin his work is a priority. We have needed to secure the support of the Australian states in order to agree on appropriate powers for the Inspector of Transport Security. So, if the Leader of the Opposition is interested in progressing this legislation, he might like to do what he can to encourage the Labor states to agree on an appropriate course of action and arrangements in relation to the Inspector of Transport Security. We are seeking to work constructively with the states. The states have been helping the inspector in relation to his current inquiry, and I think it will deliver good results for all the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can tell him that it is important to the Australian people that unemployment stays at 30-year lows, as it is currently, at 4.8 per cent. It is important that we continue to keep our economy growing, as it has, in the longest stretch of continuous economic growth ever recorded in Australia. But of course challenges will come to us from time to time. At the moment, we have the challenge of record high world oil prices - the challenge that that is bringing at the petrol pump - and also inflation, but it is important that we do not take our eye off the ball and that we continue disciplined economic management. This was a point that was made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank in an interview in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, which all members would have seen and read. Ian Macfarlane, the Governor of the Reserve Bank - a position he has held for the last 10 years -  - with probably the most significant economic job in Australia, was interviewed in the Weekend Australian. He was asked about fiscal policy. He said:I have been lucky - for most of my time, fiscal policy has consisted of small surpluses.He is contrasting that with the deficits that his predecessor had for most of his period. He said:So the movement in the government account has not been big enough to be important in the consideration of monetary policy.It might become an issue because the states are now part of that equation.It is a very interesting statement from the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He would very rarely make a comment about the states. The Commonwealth budget is now in surplus, with nine surpluses out of the last 11 budgets. In 2004-05 the states had a surplus collectively of $4 billion. In 2005-06, they had a surplus of $1.2 billion but in 2006-07 - the current budget year - collectively, the states and territories of Australia are forecasting fiscal deficits of almost $5 billion; that is, the Labor states and territories have now driven their budgets out of surplus and into deficit. Based on available information for the state sector as a whole, the states are forecasting to increase their net debt over the next four years, from 2005-06, by $43 billion. So here we are: we have had the Commonwealth government retire $96 billion of Labor debt and we have the eight Labor states and territories proposing to borrow another $43 billion of net debt.As I have said on a number of occasions, all other things being equal, if the government is a saver rather than a borrower, the government is exerting downward pressure on interest rates and, if the government is a borrower rather than a saver, the government is exerting upward pressure on interest rates. We now have the Commonwealth government exerting downward pressure on interest rates and fiscal policies at the state level working counter to that - a point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank felt compelled to make on Saturday, and I only wish that every single member of this parliament had read the newspaper on Saturday morning.</DOC>

 - That is because the Sunday program does its own transcripts and puts them on the Sunday program's website. Just because we are interested in the question of transcripts, I went looking for a transcript myself on Saturday, because I looked at the television and I saw a question asked of the Leader of the Opposition. He was asked whether or not he had any -  - I am entitled to answer a dorothy dixer from the member for Lilley. I went looking for the transcript on Saturday. I could have sworn I saw the Leader of the Opposition asked a question about Ian Macfarlane's comments. He went into this long diatribe about Ian Macfarlane and I thought, 'The poor old Reserve Bank governor; what's he done to deserve that? - Why is the Reserve Bank governor getting a serve from the Leader of the Opposition?' Mr Speaker, you might think it was Ian Macfarlane, the Reserve Bank governor. But, blow me down, it was not; it was the industry minister that was in the paper.As the Prime Minister said, whenever you see a statement from John Howard from now on, make sure it is not from John Howard the actor - because he could be attacking John Howard the actor. There are some people that get up and read newspapers on Saturday morning; there are other people that go out and share their ignorance -  -  - No. When I finally find the transcript - oh, here it is! Get a load of this: it is put out under the Leader of the Opposition's letterhead. - Well, the member for Lilley asked me - The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - Here we are: 'Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Kim Beazley'. Get a load of this. This is how it is headed up: 'Partial transcript of a doorstop interview, Pyrmont, 12 August 2006'. When you go all the way through here, there is only one question that never made it - we have Wilson Tuckey mentioned; we have Lebanon mentioned; we have the UN mentioned; we have Sydney airport mentioned - the question about the Reserve Bank governor. Why would you go to all the effort of putting out a partial transcript of your comments? I will tell you why. Because you faked the contents and you did not have the guts to put out the fact that you did not even know who the Governor of the Reserve Bank was. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for the question because I know there is a very real interest in what has tragically occurred in the United Kingdom. These terror related investigations of course are a timely reminder to us all that we here in Australia need to remain vigilant. There is no known link from this event to Australia, but our agencies are working closely with the United Kingdom and the United States on terrorism issues generally. Our agencies have recently recommended that Australia's national counter-terrorism alert remain at medium, which means that a terrorist act could occur in Australia. The words they use are that 'a terrorist act is feasible'. The government has recently ensured that our law enforcement and security agencies have the legislative tools they need, and one of those was preventive detention. Of particular interest is that the British government is using preventive detention now to limit the ability of suspects to engage in further activity.Another valuable resource we have in our community is the contributions that are made to the national security hotline. I am sure that we all remember the number 1800 123 400. The United Kingdom has a similar hotline and it has proven invaluable there. Our hotline has received more than 80,000 calls, more than half providing information to agencies. Members should encourage their constituents to use that hotline on appropriate occasions. ASIO has identified around 3,000 calls that warrant further inquiry. The government is properly resourcing agencies to handle those inquiries. ASIO is on track to meet the government endorsed target of 1,860 staff by the year 2010-11. The growth in staffing will continue to boost ASIO's ability to meet the challenges of the present security environment.The potential attacks in the United Kingdom were to be on a key element of infrastructure. This government has undertaken a comprehensive security assessment of all key infrastructure across Australia. A genuine partnership between government and industry has ensured that information sharing is in place to enable industry to make informed decisions on infrastructure security needs. While terrorists might attempt to strike directly at Australia, I can assure the House that the government is working hard to ensure that that does not happen.</DOC>

 - The introduction of the new aviation security identification cards has been a very substantial exercise which is now largely complete. Tens of thousands of cards have been required to be issued. We have had good cooperation from the airlines and the various airport authorities in implementing this substantial improvement in the security regime at our airports around the country. It is inevitable in any system that there will be a very small error rate, and in this particular instance you have identified a small number.In reality, it is an offence not to report those losses. They are individually followed up to ensure that, where a lost card occurs, it can be quickly identified and cancelled so that there is no risk of it being incorrectly used. But it is inevitable that, from time to time, cards will be lost and, therefore, you need to have in place appropriate mechanisms to deal with it. I am aware of some staff members and others in this place who lose their card from time to time and, therefore, attendants and others must chase them up and deal with the issues. We will have to do similar things in relation to aviation security, and there is an appropriate regime in place to deal with those occasional lost cards.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and recognise his interest in the safety of all Australians travelling around the world. Whilst the UK just a few hours ago reduced its assessment level from critical to severe in relation to the terrorism threat in the UK, the United States has maintained its level at high. As a result, there are requirements being placed on all international airlines, and passengers, operating into the United States. For instance, Australian passengers embarking on flights to the US are being asked to go through additional screening measures. They are not allowed to carry liquids or gels, of any size, through the screening point. That includes beverages, duty-free beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, toothpaste and other items of similar consistency. They can put these sorts of items in their luggage, and I would certainly encourage passengers who have any questions to talk to their airline, before they go to the airport, to make sure that the goods they are proposing to carry onto the aircraft will be allowed through security. Items excluded from the list of prohibited items include baby formulas and juice - if there is a baby or small child travelling with the passengers. Liquid medicines will need to be verified, so I would again encourage passengers to talk to their airlines and their doctors about what might be necessary to carry on flights of that nature.I thank passengers, who I appreciate are being put to some inconvenience as a result of these extra measures. The measures are a requirement of the United States while their terrorism threat is high, and we need to do what we can to cooperate with them in ensuring that passengers travelling to and from the United States can do so in safety.</DOC>

I also recall, as I am sure the Leader of the Opposition does, the statements contained in the white paper - and what they lay out is that LPG, which is currently excise free, will remain excise free until 2011 and that from 2011 through to 2015 there will be a rise from zero to effectively less than half the excise on petrol. As well as recalling the Treasurer's statements, I also recall the statements made by the member for Batman on ABC Radio National this morning when, in an interview with Fran Kelly, he followed the remarks made by the member for Hunter - and I recall his remarks, too. The member for Hunter was attacking the government's excise regime for LPG; the member for Batman was praising it. You see, I listen to these characters very, very carefully - I keep an eye and an ear on them - and what I heard from the member for Batman was a refutation of what the member for Hunter had said and an endorsement of the government's policy. Our excise regime provides a massive, ongoing incentive for investment in alternative energy.I also recall - and I might have something to say about this in my statement after questions - that several years ago the worst possible alternative fuel that anybody could possibly contemplate, in the eyes of the Australian Labor Party, was ethanol. Remember? It was not the demon drink; it was the evil ethanol - and the last thing that you should have was ethanol. They tried to destroy it. The member for Hotham and, I think, even the member for Batman, who is normally the acme of responsibility amongst opposition sinners on this issue, lapsed into a bit of rhetoric, of which I will be pleased to remind him of in my statement. Yes, I remember all of those things, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, and the thing that stands out is that we have got the right balance in relation to excise. - It is a balance which encourages very heavy investment in LPG and very heavy investment in ethanol but is also sensible about the future revenue needs of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his thoughtful question. I also recognise and welcome to the parliament members of the Australian Defence Force who are here today and thank them for their service to our country.Too many Australian families, and our country, have been scarred by terrorist bombings in Bali in this decade, and by 2010 this government will have increased its investment in counter-terrorism by $8.3 billion. In the Australian Defence Force, there are a number of initiatives which we have undertaken to strengthen our security, domestically and throughout the region. And the reminder that we as Australians and the world were given with the interception of the terrorist plot in the United Kingdom is a timely reminder of the importance of these initiatives.The government has established the special operations command, essentially for special forces, to enhance the coordination of the Australian Defence Force counter-terrorist capabilities. We have also established a second tactical assault group on the eastern seaboard. Our special forces presence in Swanbourne, Perth, is well known. They are now also established on the eastern seaboard. The Incident Response Regiment, comprising 300 Australian Defence Force personnel with specialist skills and equipment to deal with chemical, biological, radiological and explosive threats, has been established. In addition to that, there is a ready response force which is trained for short-notice response to domestic security incidents, including terrorist incidents and civil emergencies.Throughout our region, whatever the economic, cultural and political differences between the countries in our region, we face a common enemy. That enemy is terrorists, many of whom have hijacked the Islamic faith for evil ends. We are working with the Philippines in intelligence training and annual hostage recovery exercises. We are also developing, with the Philippines defence force, an army watercraft capability to support the policing and patrolling of the riverine and marshland areas in Mindanao, where terrorists have growing support and are establishing training camps. The Australian Defence Force has also been working with specialist units of the Indonesian military on counter-hijack and hostage recovery training. We are working annually with the Singaporeans, on the chemical, biological and radiological explosives exercise, and their counterpart unit. And across our region we are working with 15 countries in a Regional Special Forces Counter-Terrorism Conference, and those in the traditional Five Power Defence Arrangements are now moving their collective attention to non-conventional threats.We as Australians are involved in what will be a generational activity: fighting terrorism. It is not something that is confined to our borders, nor indeed to our region. Everything that we do throughout the world needs to be done to see that the next generation is not left hostage to a force that it may never control.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that I think I see a good amendment of life in the member for Batman because the member for Batman is talking sense on energy - unlike the member for Hunter, with great respect -  - Who is talking nonsense. I will have something to say about that issue but, if you really want to have a degree of bipartisanship on this issue, it would be a good idea if the views and the nostrums of the member for Batman on such things as uranium enrichment were absorbed by those who sit alongside him on the opposition frontbench.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Of course, the member for Greenway would have recognised that the trade statistics that came out last week showed that in 2005-06 the overall output of our exports was $192 billion - a significant increase on the previous year - and that manufactured exports made a significant contribution to that: they had increased by 12 per cent on the previous year. So, out of $192 billion worth of exports of goods and services, our manufacturing exports increased by 12 per cent, to a record $39.5 billion.There are a couple of examples from the member for Greenway's electorate that contributed to that. Antec Engineering in Blacktown export furnace parts to markets such as Japan, and Circuitlink International in Seven Hills export electronic equipment for the automotive industry. They are a part of that record of $39.5 billion worth of exports.Some of the other big performers in this category are as follows. Aluminium was up 28 per cent to a record $4.8 billion. Unworked copper was up 59 per cent to $2.1 billion. Motor vehicle exports increased 14 per cent to a record $3.1 billion. And medicines rose 18 per cent to a record $3 billion.It is interesting that that area of high-tech manufacturing - the medications sector - increased 18 per cent to $3 billion. I need to highlight one of those great success stories as far as medicines are concerned - one that is of personal interest to me - and that is Peplin Biotech Ltd, which produce a topical gel for treating non-melanoma skin cancer. They are exporting to the world a medicine that has been developed in Australia. The operation was opened on the Gold Coast by Ian Macfarlane - the industry minister Ian Macfarlane! - and there was no mistake by the staff at Peplin on who they had opening the plant. But, importantly, the point should be made that our exports are growing across the full sector and particularly in that biotech area. It is very important, and we recognise that.So, since the coalition came to power, manufactured exports have increased by 53 per cent. I have seen the comments by the Leader of the Opposition, talking about how they grew under Labor, but we should recognise that they were right down on a low base. What they need to recognise is the fact -  - that manufactured exports -  - have grown up to $39.5 billion. We have gone from $99 billion worth of exports in 1996 to $192 billion worth in 2006. There is a whole range of government policies that are assisting the manufacturing industries in Australia to export to the world, whether they be the sound economic management that we have given this country or the workplace reforms that we have introduced to ensure that they can remain competitive and produce more jobs in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - That is a great question from the member for McPherson, and I appreciate her asking that question and recognise and appreciate her opening the new Medicare office in her electorate recently, at Elanora. The member for McPherson and all Australian families would welcome the announcement made by the Prime Minister and the minister for health yesterday -  - and myself. Thank you, Prime Minister. I was trying to be humble. - Thank you, Prime Minister. The announcement yesterday was that, from around the middle of next year, all Australians will be able to simply swipe their Medicare cards and swipe a bankcard and they will not have to go to a Medicare office in order to claim their Medicare rebate. Currently 80,000 Australians queue up every day in Medicare offices to claim back their Medicare rebate. There are about 14,000 doctors' surgeries out there. Most of them already have EFTPOS machines. So commonsense would say that, if they can simply swipe their credit card or their debit card in the machine along with their Medicare card, why can't we put the money straight into their bank accounts and save them going to a Medicare office?We listen to the Australian people and we listen to Australian families and we are responding accordingly. It is a great win for people, I must say, not only in the metropolitan areas, where it takes an average of about 25 to 29 days for people to claim back their Medicare rebate. In the bush it can take up to 79 days for people to get their Medicare rebate. Under this new system, as soon as they swipe their bankcard the money will go into their bank account. They will be able to go down the road to their EFTPOS machine and claim the money back or spend it however they wish. So it is a significant step forward; it is a positive step forward for Australian families. The average cost to an Australian family of going and claiming their Medicare rebate is $10, and that does not include parking fees and a range of other charges that people have to put up with - so this is a no-brainer. It is a no-brainer that delivers real benefits to the Australian people, and it illustrates yet again, as my friend the minister for health would say, that the Howard government is the best friend Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Adelaide, I am aware of some examples of people driving away without paying for their petrol. That is a product of high petrol prices, I guess, and the willingness of some in the community to avoid their legal responsibilities. I am not personally aware - and I think she would agree it is hardly reasonable that I should be aware - of the employment circumstances of everybody who works at a service station. From two generations of my family's experience, I do know something about what is involved in working at a petrol service station. In fact, one of my own sons worked at a BP some years ago, so I am very familiar. But all I can say - and I am not casting an opinion on this case as I do not know the facts and circumstances and it would not be fair of me, in relation to either the young man or his employer, to express an opinion - is that generally speaking, irrespective of what industrial relations laws you have, some employers do the wrong thing and some employees do the wrong thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. In direct response to him, I can inform him and other members of the House that more than 950,000 Australian workplace agreements have been approved. - It was 950,000, almost a million. The member for Canning would be pleased to know that some 21,000 have been signed by people living in his electorate - just a few more than have been signed by people living in Brand, the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition.Why are so many Australians signing Australian workplace agreements? Part of the reason is that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, people on AWAs earn 100 per cent more than people employed under awards. No wonder 21,000 AWAs have been signed in the electorate of Canning. These instruments have become an integral part of Australia's industrial landscape: for example, they are an integral part of the massive boom in the mineral and resources industries in Australia. Just recently Steve Knott, the Executive General Manager of the Australian Mines and Metal Association, estimated that if Australian workplace agreements were abolished, as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, it would cost the mining industry in Australia $6.54 billion. Some $6.54 billion would be the cost to the mining industry in Australia because of the decision, if ever implemented, of the Leader of the Opposition to rip up Australian workplace agreements.Over the weekend, we saw more support and evidence for flexibility within the workplace relations system coming from the Chief Executive Officer of Qantas, Mr Geoff Dixon, who foreshadowed that Jetstar would also be making use of AWAs. Why is this? Let me quote from Mr Dixon as to why:We have created jobs, unlike just about every other airline in the world. We can continue to create jobs if we can change the way we operate further and we are going to do that. What we must do and I will say now, we will have to have a degree of flexibility in how we employ people. We've been virtually a union-held company for many many years. We have 16 unions; we have 45 enterprise bargaining agreements within this company and 20 of them, or 15 of them, are live at the moment, in other words, we are negotiating them.I can understand why Qantas and Jetstar want flexibility. It is because they talk about 45 enterprise agreements. - This is just one example of those 45 enterprise agreements - 500 pages of prescriptive detail. - If you stack 45 of them up they will just about reach the ceiling.The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. - This is why Qantas and Jetstar and hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses around Australia are seeking more flexibility - so that they can create more jobs. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he has no attention to detail; otherwise, he would be supporting these changes. - The last thing you will ever hear from the Leader of the Opposition and the ALP is how to create more jobs in Australia.The member for Lyons then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We had a similar question last week, which I answered in full. I say again: Mr Andrews did appear on that show. He did so with his face blacked out because he was concerned for his own safety. He did so because he had been threatened previously when giving evidence. In preparation for that interview, Mr Andrews sought and received assistance from the department on liability issues so that he would not either contravene the Public Service Code of Conduct or in fact make libellous comments. Those were the reasons.He also provided the information of his notes to my office. My office did not coach him in any way. What he was referring to was not as a public servant of the Commonwealth; it was to his time as an officer working on behalf of the Northern Territory government in Mutitjulu. That is what he was commenting on in the Lateline program. What I find disturbing here is the Labor Party's continual focus on a whistleblower, a person who wishes to lift the -  -  - The fact is that there were a number of very concerned Australian citizens, concerned about what has been going on at Mutitjulu, who reported in the Lateline program. I remind the House of some of the comments of those who reported, over and above Mr Andrews. There was Dr Geoff Stewart -  - who, discussing those people with chlamydia and gonorrhoea, said: 'The prevalent age group that we would see would be in the age of 12 to 14 years old.' - 'There was a sort of cluster about that sort of age, but there were certainly isolated incidences in children much younger.' STI levels in Central Australia particularly are certainly some of the highest rates nationally. On the same program - the one about which the member for Wills continues to attack the evidence of an individual, wondering why that person would come forward - Jane Lloyd, from the NPY Women's Council, said this: 'They also targeted children who do not have strong families, who come from dysfunctional families. He' - referring to the paedophile - 'has made threats against this office, the NPY, so Women's Council had to withdraw all staff from there.' - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Jane Lloyd, from the NPY Women's Council, also referred to the threats from the paedophile. But it is interesting that the member for Lingiari should get up and speak on this and take a point of order, because in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Mr Skelton on 5 August on this whole issue of Mutitjulu he refers to 'the culture of cover-up'. This is what the paper had to say:A prominent figure in Labor's Alice Springs branch says: 'The ALP has always depended on the land councils to turn out the indigenous vote. With more and more blackfellas voting it's better to be seen to be defending indigenous communities than attacking them. Warren is just doing what he has always done.'Members of this House congratulate Mr Andrews for having the guts to stand up and lift the scab off this appalling situation and to try to rectify the situation on behalf of the people of Mutitjulu.</DOC>

 - I can certainly understand why the member for Bonner is interested in this topic because, thanks to the Howard government, the number of publicly funded medical graduates a year in Queensland has increased from about 220 in 1996 to over 400 now. Thanks to changes announced by the Prime Minister at COAG, there will be a further 150 places in the great state of Queensland.At COAG, the government announced a further 605 medical school places a year and 1,000 new nursing places a year. Also at COAG, the government announced more private sector training for medical specialists and a wider range of consultations available for practice nurses under Medicare. By 2012, thanks to this government, there will be an extra 1,000 publicly funded medical graduates a year, there will be an extra 3,100 nursing graduates a year, there will be an extra 486 psychology graduates a year, there will be an extra 297 pharmacy graduates a year and there will be an extra 110 dental graduates a year.Already, since 1996, there has been a seven per cent increase in the number of full-time-equivalent GPs, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. Obviously, it is not enough yet, but it is significant and it is substantial. On a day of good news from the Howard government, this is more good news from the Howard government. It is further proof that, when it comes to the medical workforce, the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - The Australian government has a lot more than four teams of police to protect Australian regional airports. We have security plans at each of the airports. We have appropriate arrangements put in place to help with basic security at minor airports. The larger regional airports have full screening similar to what you would expect at capital city airports. Each airport has a level of security appropriate to the assessed needs in that particular area to ensure the safe passage of Australian passengers. There are full-time police deployments at the busier airports and those that have been classified as a first response to counter-terrorism. Those that are not covered by that full-time policing have the additional advantage, on top of the local policing that might be provided, of four deployment teams that move around the countryside from place to place to assist with training and preparations for any incident which might happen to occur.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and his interest in the Australian business sector, because it is the health of the Australian business sector which will drive our economy and will drive our employment prospects in the years which lie ahead. Today I announced the final response of the government to the regulation task force which was chaired by Gary Banks of the Productivity Commission. The government has now responded to all 178 recommendations and accepted, in full or in part, 158 of those recommendations. This is a major report on and a major response to reducing regulation and red tape on Australia's business sector. As part of that response, the government has announced tougher rules for making new regulations, including the requirement that there be cost-benefit analysis and the use of a business cost calculator developed by the Office of Small Business under which we will be able to assess the cost of new regulation on business. Cabinet will make the final decision on any new regulation, but it will only be after that rigorous process has been gone through. In addition, part of our response announced today is for the screening of all regulation at least every five years. So after five years every piece of regulation will be reviewed by the Productivity Commission to see whether or not it is still required and whether or not the cost can be reduced.Some of the individual areas where we will be simplifying regulation include working towards a single regulator for mine safety; FBT reporting exclusions for pooled motor vehicles; improving advice for occupational health and safety; simplifying accounting methods for small restaurants, cafes and caterers; streamlining business names through the ABN-ABR system; aligning definitions of 'small business', 'employer' and 'associate'; and aligning training and licensing and mutual recognition of occupations. This comes in addition to changes which the government announced in April which raised thresholds in relation to fringe benefits exemptions and reportable benefits exclusions. In addition, in April we announced a halving of the cost of incorporating a company and provision for companies to make their annual reports available on the internet rather than having to mail out hard copies.This is part of a determined effort by the Australian government to reduce unnecessary regulation so as to free up the business sector. It comes in addition to tax cuts for the business sector which the government announced in this year's budget and our ongoing campaign to have the states acknowledge the intergovernmental agreement and abolish those indirect taxes which were part of the original agreement to bring in the GST. Australia's economy will be driven by the health of its business sector, and reducing unnecessary red tape is a big part of that.</DOC>

 - As happened yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition has not checked his facts. He is wrong and, unfortunately, that has been typical of his approach to these sorts of issues. - The reality is that the gate that was open and featured on the front page of the Daily Telegraph - so he did get up early enough to read the front page of the Daily Telegraph today - was not the gate to the security area of the airport; it was the access to a construction site at the Qantas terminal - and a second fence, with an appropriate security gate and appropriate protection and meeting the appropriate standards, was in place to ensure the security of the airport area.Mr Gilmour, the General Manager of Corporate Affairs of Sydney Airport Corporation, has issued a statement to that effect, which states quite clearly that the article in the Daily Telegraph referred to a gate which was on the landside work site and does not provide access to the secure area of the airport. The gate leads to a Qantas hangar which is currently undergoing refurbishment. There is a further security fence behind the construction site which provides security for the airport. So, in fact, the operations of the airport were appropriate in this instance. There was construction going on, so they provided a new security fence to appropriate standards to ensure that the airport airside area was secure.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Casey for his interest and for his question. I think all of us are reminded by the events in Britain in the last week of the continuing threat of global terrorism and the importance of international cooperation. That has always been this government's approach. We know that we need to work with other countries to defeat terrorism. We know that it will be a long and hard battle and that it requires a lot of courage and strength to take it on.Last Thursday the Leader of the Opposition made a speech to the Lowy Institute, which I sat and read myself, because I am hardworking, I read the newspapers and I read people's speeches and I like to know what is going on. I read this speech and I noticed the Leader of the Opposition running his usual line that we should admit defeat in Iraq, we should surrender in Iraq and we should run away from the terrorists and give them a magnificent and enormous victory in Iraq, but we should fight terrorism in Afghanistan, and the speech goes on to say:But we should bring our troops home, and I want our troops in our region now.They are the exact words he used in his speech - I read it.Bring the troops from Iraq and put them somewhere in our region.Where these troops would be sent would be a matter of great interest to the government. But the Leader of the Opposition goes on to make a point that this government does not do anything to address counter-terrorism in our region. Elect the Leader of the Opposition and, no doubt, all of these problems would be solved overnight. The government is doing an enormous amount to help fight terrorism in our region. We have, for example, 12 memoranda of understanding on counter-terrorism with countries in our region, out of which comes an enormous array of activities. In the last budget - if the Leader of the Opposition had chosen to read the last budget or had concentrated on it - the government committed nearly $100 million - $92.6 million - over four years to boost regional counter-terrorism capabilities. That is a total of something like $400 million that we have spent on enhancing regional counter-terrorism capabilities since 2004.The Australian government convened, with the Indonesian government, a ministerial summit on counter-terrorism, bringing together countries of the region. Out of that was established what is called JCLEC, the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. Something like 1,200 security officers have already been trained by this Jakarta centre - thanks to Australia, and obviously the Indonesians - in support of other countries in the region. In South-East Asia some 300 terrorists have been tracked down and brought to justice. I think we in this country should pay tribute to the work that the Indonesian government has done.The point I make is this: the Leader of the Opposition professes to be some sort of an expert on foreign and defence policy. Indeed, I think members of the House may recall that he once said his only ambition was to be the defence minister - one he has fulfilled. That probably pretty much sums it up. But my contention here, in answer to the honourable member's question, is that the Leader of the Opposition should read what the government is doing, he should understand what the government is doing -  - I make the point that it is incumbent on somebody in the position of Leader of the Opposition to read what the government is doing and understand what the government is doing, not make lazy allegations. By the way, I congratulate the Australian today on offering him a free subscription to their newspaper. Let me suggest to the opposition leader: it is a good read today; you should have a good look at it. There are things in it that might interest you.</DOC>

 - My comments yesterday were accurate. There have been detailed discussions with the states in relation to what sorts of powers should be made available to the Inspector of Transport Security. The states need to be involved because many of the issues which would be under consideration are in fact within the province of the states. Land transport issues are essentially the responsibility of the states and therefore it has been necessary to discuss those issues with the states. That has happened at officer level and indeed also at ministerial level. - Yes, I have finished.</DOC>

 - I thank Mr Causley, the honourable member for Page, for his question. It was 10 years ago yesterday that the government set Australia's monetary policy in place. It was set in place by a statement on the conduct of monetary policy which was exchanged between the Governor of the Reserve Bank and me. The statement on the conduct of monetary policy set the objective of keeping underlying inflation between two and three per cent on average over the cycle. That agreement was entered into by an exchange of letters on 14 August 1996 - my letter to the governor inviting him to subscribe to that statement and his letter to me confirming that he did fully understand and agree to that proposal. Since the statement on the conduct of monetary policy has been in place over the last 10 years, inflation has averaged 2.6 per cent compared with 4.5 per cent in the preceding 10 years; GDP growth has averaged 3.6 per cent per year, and, as the OECD notes, we have now surpassed the living standards of all of the G7 with the exception of the United States; and sustained economic growth has seen employment grow by an average annual rate of two per cent. So I think we can say that the conduct of monetary policy over the last 10 years, in association with the government's economic policy, has been a big part of the nation's success. Can I confirm for the record that the statement on monetary policy was entered into not between me and the member for Groom but between me and Mr Ian Macfarlane, the Governor of the Reserve Bank.Some people will think that this was just pretty standard, that there was nothing new about it, but I thought that on the 10-year anniversary I should remind the House that Labor not only opposed the statement on the conduct of monetary policy but threatened to sue the government in the High Court for entering into it. I have a press release here dated 13 August 1996 from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, headed 'Labor to seek legal advice on Costello bank letter plan'. It says:The Federal Opposition today decided to seek legal advice on Treasurer Peter Costello's plan to require the next Reserve Bank Governor to sign a written 'inflation first' pledge._         _         _'The Federal Opposition will be treating this issue seriously and will not allow the Government to subvert the Reserve Bank's legislative Charter ...The quote continues:'That is why we will be seeking further legal opinion on the legality of the Costello proposal, and the option of the Federal Opposition going to the High Court to force the Government to abide by all of the provisions of the RBA Act.'Ten years after that statement on the conduct of monetary policy, no sane Australian would say that they would change it. Indeed, no sane Australian would now say it should not have been entered into. But on 13 August 1996 not only did the Labor Party oppose this forward-looking policy but they threatened to sue the government to prevent it being put in place. There are some people that wonder why Labor have no economic credibility. Labor have no economic credibility because they are led by the member for Brand, Mr Beazley - and exhibit A in relation to the economic incompetence of the member for Brand is his press release of 13 August 1996 opposing probably the best monetary policy that Australia has had, and probably the most successful monetary policy of any country in the world. It has been successful because nobody listened to him in relation to it. I table exhibit A on the economic incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

I do recall the letter that I wrote to her on the advice provided by the department with respect to the circumstances that they investigated following the receipt of her letter. I think this area is in fact an area that is changing quite quickly. -  - I did not actually write that letter yesterday, I might tell the opposition. - It is quite true that I said that LPG is not available in all rural and regional areas. It is available in about 3,000 service stations across Australia, but not in all rural and regional areas, and that is what my letter said. The policy at the time was that we did not need to look at every single change. As I said, I think things are changing quite dramatically. We are certainly encouraging a greater use of LPG. In fact, the announcements yesterday will make a huge difference ultimately in that availability of LPG, which will change the situation quite dramatically. It is a bit like ethanol, which is changing dramatically.I do not know whether the member for Throsby has ever used ethanol in her car. I certainly use ethanol in mine. I filled up at an independent service station in Queanbeyan, the first service station in this region to provide E10. Take your cars down to Brett in Queanbeyan and get some E10, as I have been doing. The whole range is changing and this whole area will change a lot more in the weeks and months and years to come. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for asking a question today while we have with us in Canberra the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of South Korea, Ban Ki-moon, who has certainly in his time as the foreign minister been a very good friend to Australia. We have enjoyed a happy relationship with him. One of the difficulties that we - the Australian, South Korean and other governments - have had to deal with has been North Korea. The firing on 5 July of seven missiles, including one Taepo Dong II intercontinental ballistic missile, by North Korea was a matter of very deep concern. This Taepo Dong II missile, as I was explaining a couple of years ago, is a missile with a potential range of 15,000 kilometres, so it does have the potential capability of reaching the United States or, for that matter, not that it is likely to happen, even reaching Australia.In response to this, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 1695 imposing some legally binding measures for the first time on North Korea to prevent the transfer of missile and weapons of mass destruction components. We strongly supported that resolution and it was passed unanimously. I think one of the most interesting things about it was the very appropriate and encouraging support for that resolution by China. When I was in Japan recently, two weeks ago, I had the opportunity of discussing this issue with the Japanese government and also, a week earlier, with Secretary of State Rice in the ASEAN Regional Forum. Secretary of State Rice organised, on 28 July, a 10-party meeting, with five of the six parties to the six-party talks - that is obviously excluding North Korea - as well as five other countries including Australia. This was an opportunity for all of us to ensure that, as best we possibly can, we can have a coordinated approach to this issue. I think we do have a pretty well coordinated approach.I also took the opportunity of meeting with the North Korean foreign minister, Paek Nam-sun, while I was in Kuala Lumpur, and once more reminded him of the international community's demand for North Korea not only to immediately and unconditionally return to the six-party talks but to desist from any temptation to make further missile tests. Also, I think it is fair to say that we would of course be very anxious that North Korea would not contemplate conducting any nuclear tests, and that is a matter of some concern. It is not to say that I think it is going to happen, but it is a possibility.The point I would make in conclusion is that this is a crucially important issue for our region. It is centrally important in addressing the issue that we, as a region and as a broader international community, remain coordinated and focused in applying, if you like, penalties to North Korea for bad behaviour and incentives for good behaviour should they decide to change their ways. And I have been encouraged by the support that China has shown for that policy.</DOC>

Changes have taken place in a whole variety of areas as we have undergone reform and development - particularly in the energy area, which has changed dramatically in the last few years. Certainly, the comments in my letter supported the policies that had been put in place by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, but the whole world of energy has changed dramatically -  - Even since July it has changed - absolutely - and we will continue to develop policy further.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I think members recognise his very conscientious interest in matters of security and the protection of the Australian community. Of course, this government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to protecting security. We are doing so by ensuring that our agencies are able to effectively deal with the range of security threats that we might face. I think it is timely to note that in the United Kingdom the close collaboration between police and security agencies was instrumental in dealing with the difficult situation that they were facing. The fact is that our security agency and policing authorities work very closely together. I remember the words of the former director of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, who said they have a very high degree of interoperability together - and ASIO's volume of work continues to increase as the organisation protects Australians and Australia's interests from the threat of terrorists.New leads in particular require that investigations continue - and we have seen a significant increase in the number of investigations required. Experience shows that we need to be constantly looking at emerging threats - a very difficult and challenging task. Last year we asked Allan Taylor to undertake a review of security organisations, and he recommended that substantial new resources be particularly applied to ASIO to meet those demands. The government has funded that body and it will increase ASIO staff to 1,860 over the next five years. It currently has around 1,100 staff - nearly double the number it had in 2000-01. The organisation plans to recruit 170 staff, net, each year for the coming years and is tracking well to meet this target for this financial year. Its recruitment will progressively, but substantially, grow our security organisation's capability.Our recruitment of intelligence officers is important - and that is strong. It will boost ASIO's ability to meet the challenges of the security environment. Recruitment and clearance of suitable officers is a lengthy process, but we will not be compromising on the quality of staff that we need. This government has ensured that ASIO is now well resourced to continue protecting the Australian community in the difficult environment in which we are operating.</DOC>

But whether Billy has been treated unfairly, as implied by the member for Adelaide, would depend upon all of the circumstances, and -  - I have unhappily had the experience in this House of questions being put to me by the opposition that have not had the full facts. I do not think the member for Adelaide would fall into that category and I would prefer to give her the benefit of the doubt. So I will get all of the facts.

 - I thank the member for Kingston not only for his question but also for the hard work he has done in representing the concerns of his constituents, particularly on the issue of fuel prices and what the government should be doing in terms of relieving them. Those on this side of the House believe in responsible economic management so that, when the government need to give support to the community, we are able to. At a time of historically high oil prices globally, the government has acted to help Australian motorists, announcing practical steps for cheaper fuel options and long-term energy security. $1.5 billion of assistance was announced yesterday -  - I will come to you, Member for Hunter - and amongst those initiatives was $677 million to encourage the uptake of LPG, $17 million to help service station operators upgrade equipment for ethanol blended fuel and $135 million to boost petroleum exploration in Australia. The response from industry and the support for this package is very strong. The NRMA has said it is:... a seriously good package for families and the local alternative fuels industry.The Australian Automobile Association says:The initiatives ... will increase competition ... through making alternatives, such as LPG and ethanol blends, more competitive and attractive to the average consumer.On that topic, in the three hours that the hotline had operated to noon today, there had been 1,100 calls -  - Are you listening to this, Joel? There had been 1,100 calls to that hotline centre and 80 per cent of them were about retrofitting LPG to their vehicles. - The member for Hunter does not understand a basic principle of commerce: that if you increase demand you increase supply. And that is what will happen with LPG supply -  - Despite the fact that I am not the Reserve Bank governor, I know a lot more about economics than you do. Of course, I am asked about -  - Mr Speaker -  
An opposition member - Use the banana defence. - We know about bananas. I am asked about threats to energy prices in Australia and the threat comes from those who sit opposite and their climate change policy. The Labor Party has a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. Recent ABARE analysis said that a 50 per cent reduction would double the price of fuel to Australian motorists -  - A load of rubbish, he says! - On the Labor Party's policy, while they sit here -  - and deride what the government did yesterday - something that was welcomed and supported by industry and has been supported by motorists today - they have in their back pocket a policy which will double the price of petrol to motorists in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question and for his obvious interest in the workers at Cowra. I have been informed that Cowra Abattoir is currently under voluntary administration. In the normal course, if a decision is taken by the administrator to place Cowra Abattoir into liquidation, then this government will provide swift financial assistance through the GEER scheme to support those eligible employees who remain out of pocket because of any inability on the part of the employer to provide them with their entitlements.I remind the House that, since the inception of this scheme in the year 2000, the Australian government has helped over 59,000 employees and has advanced over $697 million in assistance to them. This is a scheme that only this government has put into operation. A couple of years ago we sought that the states contribute, on a fifty-fifty basis with the Commonwealth, to a national scheme that would provide further entitlements to workers who find themselves in this situation in Australia. Regrettably, we have not had assistance from the states in order to do that. - I fully appreciate the member for Calare's concern in this regard. As I said, we will await the advice of the administrator. I understand that the administrator is trying to sell this business as a going concern. If that business can be sold as a going concern - which might involve some restructure because of the financial difficulty that the business is facing - it will be the best outcome for the workers, their families and the people of Cowra more broadly because it will preserve jobs in Cowra. We will continue to monitor the situation and, if there is any further information I can provide to the honourable member, I will do so.Can I make this final point: we were mocked in this place because we said, when this was raised by the Labor Party and the ACTU, that in some circumstances businesses will have to restructure to remain viable. The Office of Workplace Services found that this business had been facing financial difficulty over a long period of time. Regrettably that has proven to be the case, and I think some of the people on the other side should think again about what they said earlier on.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He would be aware that most remote Indigenous communities rely on just one store per community. The unfortunate reality is that many of those stores have had poor and inadequate management. There has been a poor range of stock and, quite often, that stock has been overpriced. Just today Alan Williams, who is the former executive of Coles Food and Liquor and is now on the new board of Outback Stores, which had its inaugural meeting here yesterday, had this to say:There are many examples where there are more products going out the back door than there are going out the front door, and we have got to stop that. The second stage is that we will start working with nutrionists who will work with the stores and with the community health workers and local schools to start raising nutritional profile.As the member for Solomon would be aware, the Council of Remote Area Nurses of Australia said, when asked by the government, that if there were one thing that could do more to lift the life expectancy and the nutritional value for Indigenous people, in particular Indigenous children in these remote communities, it would be the better provision of food. The expertise of Coles and Woolworths has been provided and, to that end, I want to pay my public thanks to Roger Corbett and John Fletcher, two of Australia's greatest retailers, who have put the expertise, their personal commitment and their companies' commitment behind this initiative to ensure that Australian Aboriginals that live in remote communities have access to the best training, the best management, good supply chains and good point of sale operation so that nutritional value can be delivered in these communities, which is not currently occurring in all of them.We should point out that there are some excellent examples. Arnhem Land Progress Association, ALPA, is but one that has done a wonderful job up there with its six stores. It also supports seven others. But what is paramount here is that more than 100 other stores need assistance. The Outback Stores initiative will provide the best quality advice that Coles, Woolworths and Metcash can bring to bear. The sum of $48 million has been provided by the federal government through my colleague the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and his department to bring all of that together to deliver better health outcomes, better economic outcomes and a brighter future for remote Indigenous Australians.</DOC>

 - The member for Braddon is a great enthusiast for the health facilities in his electorate - most notably and most recently, the brand-new rural clinical school at Burnie, which will soon be training up to 50 or 60 medical students in his area. I want to congratulate him on the fact that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate is now 17 percentage points higher than it was in December 2003.The private health insurance rebate is one of the signature policies of the Howard government. It saves the average privately insured family more than $1,000 a year - and that is great news for the 26,000 people in the electorate of Braddon who are covered by private health insurance. I can advise the House that in the last year an extra 150,000 people joined the ranks of those covered by private health insurance. That means 10.2 million Australians are now covered by hospital or ancillary policies, and that is an absolute, all-time record. As the member for Braddon knows, it certainly helps to take the pressure off our public hospitals because, if the two million admissions to private hospitals a year did not have private health insurance, sure as anything they would be on the public hospital waiting list queue. This government is getting on with the job of making a good system even better.I think it is worth noting that, since the last election, government members have asked no fewer than 105 questions on health - that is, 105 questions in 115 parliamentary sitting days. There have been just 14 questions from the member for Lalor. Since the last election, the member for Lalor has put out 118 press releases and not a single policy. - No. - Obviously from that point of order the Leader of the Opposition is hiding the member for Griffith as well as he is hiding the member Lalor. The simple truth of the matter is that this government is interested in health. All the opposition are interested in is the politics of health. They are not interested in any benefits for patients. Meanwhile, this government is going from strength to strength as the best friend that Medicare has ever had. - </DOC>

I am also aware of the fact that there were 2,800 applications for these 200 jobs. And I am also aware that, in addition to the fact that the jobs will pay between $41,000 and $60,000 a year, the AWAs include entitlements such as a three per cent pay rise annually for each year of the agreement, six weeks annual leave and a guaranteed eight rostered days off every 28-day rostered period. I am also aware of the fact that there was nothing in the pre Work Choices law that required Jetstar employees in these circumstances to be paid the same salary levels as Qantas long-haul cabin crew. In other words, this is not the result of Work Choices; it is the result of the normal operations of the labour market - and the member for Perth ought to know it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and note her interest in these matters. The Howard government has a strong record of supporting women throughout their life stages. We have delivered choice and opportunities for women so that there are more jobs for women, higher pay and more educational and training opportunities. Women have benefited not only from the strong management of our economy but also from a range of initiatives and reforms including our Welfare to Work reforms, our Work Choices legislation, the increased superannuation and the co-contribution scheme and the increase in the number of child-care places that have been made available for working women.I am pleased to announce to the House that last week, for the first time since our coming to office, the number of new jobs created for Australian women passed the one million mark: 1,013,600 new jobs for women have been created since 1996. Under Labor, there were a million people unemployed. Under the coalition, a million new jobs have been created for women. Female unemployment is at 4.8 per cent. There are in fact over 4.6 million women in employment in Australia, and that is a 28 per cent increase since 1996. Interestingly, the employment rate of women in the 60 to 64 age cohort has more than doubled since we came to office. Under the Howard government, women of Australia are receiving many more choices and many more opportunities.</DOC>

 - I believe that the only thing I can usefully add to the answer I gave to the member for Perth is to make what I hope is the reasonable observation that I am not aware that the industrial relations policy even of the Australian Labor Party in 2006 requires that everybody working for a company be paid precisely the same wage - which of course is implicit in the envy based question asked by the honourable member. The reality is that here we have 200 more jobs being created. We have a 30-year low in unemployment. We have the highest participation rate on record. And all the Labor Party can do is to begrudge another 200 Australians getting a decent job. I think the Labor Party ought to be ashamed of itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his commitment to helping drive down Australia's numbers of unemployed. Australia's dole queues have halved since 1996, as our Prime Minister has just reminded us. The Howard government has created nearly two million jobs. There has never been such an amazing time, a great opportunity for our long-term unemployed to find a job - often, for them, the first job. Our long-term unemployed are amongst the most disadvantaged in Australia's society.Our new Welfare to Work initiative is of course giving job seekers an extra hand up, but one of the things we have found is that employers are tending to reject some half of their applicants for a job vacancy on the basis that they do not have relevant work experience or, in many cases, that they have no work experience at all. That is where our Welfare to Work program comes into it. We are now requiring each project in our Welfare to Work and Work for the Dole programs to have relevant, local workplace skill deficits reflected in the program itself. As we know, there are a lot of job shortages in hospitality, tourism, retail, manufacturing and services, just to name a few of these areas.Let me give you some examples of how Work for the Dole is now giving people locally relevant skills and work experience. For example, in Dandenong, in the electorate of Bruce, the Red Cross is having teams of our Work for the Dole people help to make their Christmas cakes and bakery products, giving them a great deal of experience in becoming hospitality and cooking employees of the future. In Ingleburn, in Sydney, in the electorate of the member for Werriwa, the aged care facility is benefiting from Work for the Dole participants learning about that industry sector, helping with the care of the aged and being able to walk out of that six- or 12-months experience with a resume or a CV which is rich in information about how they are skilled and ready to work in the aged care sector. In the electorates of Lalor, Blaxland and Groom, in Laverton, Bankstown and Toowoomba, we have a lot of metal fabrication and welding being taught to our Work for the Dole participants, who are making trailers and outdoor furniture. They can then, on their resumes, explain a six- or 12-month work experience and walk into jobs in metal fabrication - another area of skills deficit across much of Australia. Finally, in Solomon, up in the Northern Territory, carpentry is being undertaken and taught to Work for the Dole participants. They are producing toys and furniture for Christmas for giving to the most needy.So here is one of our most successful employment services programs, one that is now nine years old and that has helped over half a million of our long-term unemployed Australians, some of our most disadvantaged, into work. I want to congratulate the Howard government for this initiative. It was resisted and rejected. It is in fact doing an enormous amount of work in the electorates of the opposition, helping some of the most disadvantaged into a job, to share in this country's prosperity.</DOC>

 - The situation is clear. The gate was the gate to a building site. It was the gate to reconstruction work that is going on in the Qantas hangar at Sydney airport, and it was not a part of the security system for the airport. The security system for the airport was another fence that had been constructed at the back of the construction site. Security was not in any way at risk as a result of the activities that have occurred at Sydney airport. The gate was open because it was open to a construction site where construction work was going ahead. The gate was closed in cases where it had access to runways and other airside activities.</DOC>

 - To get to the second part of the question first, it will have a devastating impact on the state of Queensland, and it is already apparent from the reaction of the Premier of Western Australia that he understands the impact -  - My attention has been drawn to the plan, and I heard the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of South Australia waxing lyrical about the plan on radio this morning. What the Labor states want and what the federal opposition wants is a European modelled emissions trading scheme starting in 2010. It has the long-term goal of reducing emissions by 60 per cent by the year 2050. It will involve a $12 to $14 carbon tax, higher electricity bills and a 37 per cent reduction in coal-fired power generation. Electricity generators and gas pipelines around Australia will be the first targeted, and additional sectors will be added over time.The hardest hit states under this plan will be the resource-exporting states of Queensland and Western Australia. Workers will see their jobs disappear and jobs exported to other parts of the world. States like South Australia that are reliant on drawing electricity from the national grid will be even more exposed. The analysis to be released by the states today indicates that, under Labor's proposal, retail electricity prices in Darwin will rise by nearly $200 a year, wholesale prices in Western Australia in each year are expected to be on average 40 per cent higher and states such as Tasmania that have a higher relative use of electricity will have higher relative increases in power bills.These proposals very closely echo the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition in his various blueprint speeches delivered last year and this year, which involve cutting emissions by 60 per cent by the year 2050, ratifying Kyoto, setting mandated emissions target reductions and establishing a national emissions trading scheme.According to ABARE, a 50 per cent cut in Australian emissions by 2050 would lead to a 10 per cent fall in GDP, a 20 per cent fall in real wages, a carbon price equivalent to a doubling of petrol prices, and a staggering 600 per cent rise in electricity and gas prices. These are not the calculations of my office. They are not the calculations of the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party. They are the calculations of the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, a very respected federal government body.So, to borrow a phrase that is beloved by the Queensland Premier, let me say to Mr Beattie: why don't you stand up for Queensland? Why don't you stand up for jobs in the coal industry in Queensland? And why don't you tell your Labor mates in New South Wales and South Australia that you are not going to have any truck with a proposal that would cripple the resource industry in Queensland, export jobs from that great state and impose unbearable, higher petrol prices on Australians at a time when we face the prospect of even higher fuel prices?</DOC>

 - I am aware of those comments made by the Treasurer and, like all the other comments the Treasurer makes, they make a great deal of sense. 
Opposition members - Not all of them. - They do. My colleague the Treasurer makes very sensible remarks on national economic management. But there are two very crucial things -  - about the Treasurer's position that the member for Grayndler did not acknowledge. Firstly, the Treasurer, unlike the party of the member for Grayndler, was not advocating a carbon tax. I know the Labor Party loves taxes but the Treasurer was not advocating a carbon tax. I also know that the Treasurer's views on this matter are within context -  -  - at least and until we have a protocol throughout the world that includes all of the major emitters, and that means the inclusion of countries such as China, the United States and India. Until we have all the major emitters, one country unilaterally embracing an emissions trading scheme will result in great damage to that country. The reason we will not sign Kyoto is that, if we were to sign, we would accept burdens under the protocol that would not apply to our competitors, such as China and Indonesia. We would export jobs, and that is my point. - For a country such as Australia, which is almost unique in the sense of being a developed country that is a net exporter of energy, to embrace the sorts of strictures, penalties and burdens being advocated by the opposition without -  - What the Labor Party wants is for a resource-rich country such as Australia to agree to an arrangement that would result in the export of investment and jobs from this country. What this government will not tolerate -  - The more the Leader of the Opposition interjects the more he proclaims his sensitivity on this issue. What Labor stands for is a policy that would export resource jobs from states like Queensland to other countries. I want to say on behalf of this government that, while ever we have control of policies in this area, we are not going to sell out the Australian resource sector and we are not going to sell out the workers in the resource industry. We are going to stand up for the resource industries in Queensland and Western Australia, because they are contributing great wealth to this nation. - Yes.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. Today's Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment figures show that consumer sentiment suffered a sharp fall of 16.2 per cent in the month of August. That is the second largest fall on record. In particular, that fall of 16.2 per cent in consumer sentiment appears to relate to the interest rate rise which the Reserve Bank of Australia announced following its meeting on 2 August.Despite the fall in consumer sentiment in the month of August, the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. We have the lowest unemployment in 30 years. We have our ninth surplus budget. We have cleared Labor's $96 billion worth of debt, and the Australian economy is forecast to grow strongly in the year ahead. Today we also had the labour price index released for the June quarter of 2006. It showed that the index grew 1.1 per cent in the June quarter and is 4.1 per cent higher through the year. This was a little higher than expected, with wage costs rising higher in the public sector than in the private sector. They were 4.4 per cent higher over the year in the public sector; whereas they were four per cent higher over the year in the private sector. Jurisdictions that recorded the fastest growth in public sector wage costs were Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania.It is important for the maintenance of a low-inflation environment in the Australian economy that wages are contained and are consistent with productivity growth. We can afford increases in real wages, as long as we have a productivity bonus that backs it up. If there is a productivity bonus that backs it up, an increase in real wages will not necessarily be inflationary. One of the advantages that we have in dealing with strong wage rises at the moment is, of course, productivity, but also we have a much better system of industrial relations than in previous periods. Nothing could be more destructive at the current time than a reversion to centralised wage fixing. The reason for that is that, whilst wage increases might be justified in profitable industries such as the mining industry, any attempt through centralised wage fixation or, indeed, pattern bargaining to bring those wage increases out of highly profitable areas of the Australian economy back into other areas of the Australian economy would be not only inflationary but anti jobs.That is why it is so important that we now have the Work Choices legislation in place in this country. If Labor had its way and rolled back Work Choices - if we were to revert to a system of awards whereby profitable industries which can afford wage increases become pacesetters for other areas of the Australian economy - we would end in an inflationary surge, which brought on previous recessions that this country could ill afford. Today's increase, backed by productivity in a situation of improved labour market arrangements, can be handled, although we need to be vigilant. Rolling back industrial relations reform in this country, at this time, would be a major retrograde step by the political party which has done so much to hold Australia back over the last 10 years. - I welcome the continued interjections from the Leader of the Opposition, as he listens to the way in which his policies could destroy Australia at a time like this. - I welcome his constant interjections, which he is engaging in from the table at the moment. - I will make just one last observation. Most people would say that today's wage growth in the June quarter was a touch higher than expected at 4.1 per cent. Let me make this point about another indicator to undermine the false claims that the Labor Party made about Work Choices. One of the constant refrains that we have heard from the Labor Party was that Work Choices would drive wages down. Yet today we find that wages have increased by 4.1 per cent, even a little higher than expected. On 21 March 2006, we had the Leader of the Opposition telling Neil Mitchell that these workplace changes are about suppressing wages. He was wrong then; he is wrong now; he has been wrong for 10 years. The last thing the Australian economy could afford would be him in any position of economic responsibility.</DOC>

 - I am not sure how many times I have to answer the question before it gets through to the honourable member for Brisbane that the fence that is normally in place around Sydney airport for security purposes has a gate in it which has been left open because of the construction activity that is going on at a Qantas site. To compensate for the fact that that fence is no longer able to fulfil its security function during the construction process, a second fence has been constructed around the work site, dividing the site from the secure area of the airport. - The General Manager of Corporate Affairs of the Sydney Airport Corporation, as I said yesterday, has informed me that the additional fencing that has been constructed meets mandated security standards. At no stage has there been any risk. The temporary fence around the construction site has needed to be accessed so some construction activity could occur, so a second security fence was in place which did meet standards and which has ensured that there has been no improper access to the regions concerned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. As the Treasurer indicated earlier this afternoon, the ABS labour price index data shows that Australian workers continue to experience strong wages growth, something which the Labor Party and the unions said would come to an end with Work Choices. Indeed, managing the economy and making the necessary reforms to the economy, including the introduction of the Work Choices legislation, is part of the reason why we continue to have not only low unemployment in Australia but, in addition to that, jobs growth and wages growth, as this data indicates.The member for Boothby asked me about any alternative policies. I note that something like nine months after the Leader of the Opposition promised to bring forward his blueprint for workplace relations in Australia and to release it in the first half of this year we are still waiting. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition will not bring forward a blueprint to roll back reform until he gets the tick-off by the union movement in Australia.I was interested to note that the Australian Labor Party is advertising its Federal Labor Business Forum for 2006. This is a very interesting document and these will be a couple of interesting days in Sydney. Business has been invited to contribute $5,000 a head to come along and learn about the alternative policies of the Australian Labor Party. I looked through this document - I looked again and again - and I could not find any reference whatsoever to industrial relations. Indeed, I looked through the document at the speakers on the list and I saw such Labor luminaries as Senator Kerry O'Brien, Senator Nick Sherry and the member for Grayndler but not the member for Perth, the spokesman on industrial relations. He does not feature on the program whatsoever.So the Labor Party are going to have this two-day talkfest in which business is invited to come along and contribute $5,000 per head to the Labor Party coffers, and yet there will be an elephant in the room which goes unmentioned - the elephant in the room in this case being their industrial relations policy, of which they will utter not a word at the present time. If they were proud of this policy and they thought they had support for it, why wouldn't they go out to the business community in Australia and say, 'We're going to rip up AWAs and this is why we're going to do it. We're going to roll back unfair dismissal laws, so that businesses in Australia will be fearful about employing people.' No, they have no courage to come forward. - I see the member for Griffith interjecting. He is not on the program either. What we have here is another failure by the opposition to put forward an alternative policy. They will not put forward an alternative policy because they have not been given it yet by the ACTU. They will not put forward an alternative policy to the business community because they know they would get a resounding response from the business community, saying, 'This will take Australia backwards. This will destroy jobs. This will destroy growth in wages' - something which this government is achieving and continues to achieve.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the reference I made to $100,000 fees was a reference to HECS funded fees; it was not a reference, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, to people who paid full fees. At present there are no $100,000 university fees for Commonwealth supported students. Let me say that again: there are no $100,000 university degrees for HECS funded places in this country. That is the situation.Let me remind the House that 97 per cent of all undergraduate Australian students are in Commonwealth supported places. For all these students the government covers 75 per cent of the cost of study. Universities may admit full fee paying students. There is a 35 per cent cap on the number of full fee paying undergraduate students, and fewer than three per cent of all undergraduate students actually take up this option. What the Labor Party is proposing is a circumstance where if you are English or American or Chinese or Japanese you can pay full fees -  - but if you are an Australian you cannot. In other words, the Labor Party wants to go back to a policy that discriminates in favour of foreigners and against Australians. - I conclude by reiterating what I said at the beginning of this answer. The reference I made, and I freely acknowledge making it, was to Commonwealth funded or HECS funded places. I repeat: there are none of those in Australia which are costing $100,000. The opposition knows that, and once again the Leader of the Opposition is misleading the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and the interest he has in Iraq. Obviously the Australian government does have a good relationship with the government of Iraq and the people of Iraq, and I think it is important we do so. The Prime Minister has visited Iraq on a number of occasions; the Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson, and his predecessor, Robert Hill, visited Iraq on a number of occasions; and I have as well. This is a very strong relationship, and I know from talking to the Iraqis that they appreciate very much the work we do to help the Iraqi security forces defeat terrorists and insurgents.As the Leader of the Opposition often likes to point out, this is a very difficult task. We remain committed to the task - to training the security forces and to providing security overwatch from the Tallil air base in the south of Iraq. We also remain committed to protecting our embassy and our embassy staff who are working in Iraq. They are doing a good job. Our embassy staff help with the administration of our aid program to the embattled people of Iraq. Our embassy staff obviously help to promote our commercial interests and advance our political interests, so it is important we keep them going. Indeed, just yesterday I announced the appointment of Marc Innes-Brown, who is an exceptional officer in my department, as the next ambassador to Iraq.Members will of course be aware of a rocket attack that injured four officers from our security detachment in Baghdad on Monday. One of the corporals - a female corporal; the Minister for Defence will correct me if I am wrong - is still in hospital, but I understand she is in good condition. Our thoughts are with those soldiers, and they are with the diplomats whom they protect. It is tough, but it is vital work.Yes, this approach is criticised by the Leader of the Opposition and those who work with him. The member for Barton, for example, rather surprisingly was reported in today's Financial Review and yesterday on the radio as having said that, following Monday's attack, we should shut down our embassy in Baghdad altogether; we should move it out of Iraq. I would say only this: we will not be doing that. If somebody attacks our embassy, our - I mean the coalition's, the Howard government's - instinctive reaction is not to close our embassy and run away. We did not close our embassy in Jakarta when it was bombed. We stuck it out. And we are going to do the same thing in Baghdad as well.Every time Australian interests are threatened or attacked overseas, the Leader of the Opposition's response is to haul up the white flag. It is always to call for surrender. He says we should surrender in Iraq to the insurgents and the terrorists. He says surrender is the best policy. And we say: to fight determinedly beside the people of Iraq is the best policy. You cannot see John Howard surrendering, as the Leader of the Opposition likes to. And when there is an attack on some Australian personnel, we do not. And you cannot see John Howard putting out a press release saying, 'Let's close our embassy.' No, we are too strong for that, but for the Leader of the Opposition his constant companion is the white flag.</DOC>

 - I will naturally, as I always do, check the transcript, but I am quite certain that, in the many interviews I gave at that time, I could well have said something to that effect. But let us analyse the reasons why the price of oil is high now. It is overwhelmingly due to the market fundamentals. It is overwhelmingly due to the strength of the -  - I will come to Iraq in a moment. It is overwhelmingly due to the massive demand that is coming out of China and, to a lesser extent, India, to the underinvestment in refining capacity and to some of the impact of the situation in the Middle East. If you are looking at Iraq and you want to improve the supply of oil by bringing more oil from Iraq on stream, what you do is defeat the insurgency, not cut and run. - What is happening at the moment is that the Iraqi government is waging a courageous battle against people who almost on a daily basis are trying to sabotage the oil extraction in Iraq, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to surrender to that insurgency. He wants to create a situation where those who would cripple the capacity of Iraq to be a further major contributor to the world's oil supply succeed. So, far from what we are now doing, the Leader of the Opposition's policy of capitulation and surrender would reinforce the position of those who would destroy Iraq's capacity to stand on her own feet and contribute to an increase in world oil supplies and, therefore, a reduction in the price of petrol at the bowser in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Of course, he would be very interested in the latter part of his question, given that he represents the majority of the landmass of Western Australia. The 2005-06 figures show that Australia reached a record export level of $192 billion worth of goods and services out of Australia. That compares to $99 billion worth when Labor was last in office during 1996.Mr Speaker, if you have a look at where some of the key increases have been, you see that, of our top 20 export products and services, 14 actually hit record levels in 2005-06. An example is coal. There was a 42 per cent increase in the export of coal in 2005-06. The two things that the member for Kalgoorlie would be interested in are obviously iron ore, exports of which were up 54 per cent, predominantly out of Western Australia, and gold, which also comes from the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, exports of which were up 29 per cent. So a number of Australia's key exports are reaching record levels.In the services sector, the export of education services rose by 13 per cent. The export of tourism and professional and business services also rose, and exports rose in the manufacturing sector in areas such as motor vehicles, up 15 per cent, and medicines, up 18 per cent. All of these contributed to that record level of exports, with $192 billion going out of Australia in the last fiscal year.This means more job opportunities for more Australians. This export effort has fed into the unemployment level dropping to 4.8 per cent. For the information of the member for Kalgoorlie, although the national unemployment level has dropped to 4.8 per cent, in Western Australia it is 3.1 per cent, significantly as a result of the export industries in that state. We recognise that one in five jobs in the Australian economy rely on export industries. In regional Australia, that is one in four jobs, and many of those are in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate in Western Australia.What are some of the impediments that are confronting our export industries? The Labor Party's position on workplace relations is one of those. You could talk to many of those great exporting industries in Western Australia, as many of the members of the Labor Party have. The Leader of the Opposition has got himself on a billboard over the road leading into Canberra airport with his shock and awe about ripping up AWAs. The member for Perth is saying to the captains of industry: 'Don't listen to what Kim's saying. We'll be able to work out how we can manage a flexible workplace if we win office.' I do not know that there is that level of commitment behind the Leader of the Opposition to ripping up the AWAs, as is seen on the billboard near Canberra airport.We have achieved these export efforts because we have continued to improve the economic environment in Australia. We have continued to create flexibility so we can compete with the rest of the world. The coalition government have been creating jobs. We know the Labor Party just want to destroy jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. I will check the figure. But whether it is right or not makes no material difference to the answer I give, because I would have thought that one of the reasons fewer people might be going on to university now is that it is easier to get a job. What a terrible thing! I think it is a good thing if you can get a job. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about turning people away from TAFE. The last time I checked, TAFEs were run by state Labor governments. The time before that that I checked, they had increased the fees by about 300 per cent. So let me say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: if there has been a situation where fewer people are going on to university, that is not of itself - and I do think that, if we are to seriously address the skills issue in this country, we need to get away from the deputy leader's mindset that the only good education is a university education -  -  - She was brought up in the culture that says that unless you go to university you are a failure. Can I say that that is one of the reasons that people have been driven out of the skilled trades. That is one of the explanations. So let me say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - Oh, we are getting sensitive about this, aren't we! - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks too many people have been turned away from TAFE, why don't you talk to Mr Beattie? Why don't you talk to Mr Iemma? Why don't you talk to Mr Carpenter, Mr Bracks or Mr Rann? -  - The Leader of the Opposition, interjecting, says, 'We do.' Well, they do not take any notice of you, do they? They have not done anything about it. Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the mindset she brings to this issue is part of the problem. It is the belief that the future of the country is driven entirely by the number of people who seek to go to university. I welcome the fact -  - Let me simply conclude and say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, if there has been a decline in the number of people going on to university in the early part of the 21st century, I think it might have something to do with the fact that unemployment is at a 30-year low.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I also thank her for the Road to recovery report prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which she chaired. The government tabled its formal response to that report in the House last week. One of the principal recommendations of the report was to investigate the effectiveness of naltrexone in treating heroin addicts. The government has committed some $1 million to fund a major trial into this.Another principal recommendation was not to support the establishment of heroin injecting rooms. I can certainly assure the House that, as long as the Howard government has breath in its body, we will try to oppose any state or territory which is conniving with law-breaking in this way. Let me say that there has been, indeed, some criticism of the government's approach in opposing heroin injecting rooms. The Leader of the Opposition, for instance, said:It is wrong for the Prime Minister to stand in the way of NSW Government's ... injecting rooms for heroin users ...Here we have it - the Leader of the Opposition: he surrenders on Iraq; he surrenders on workplace relations; he is surrendering on drugs as well.The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - Mr Speaker, as far as I am aware, it is not slanderous to quote opposition frontbenchers' words back at them. I can understand why the member for Sydney was getting agitated, because the member for Sydney said, 'I am pleased to say there will be a heroin injection room up and running in Sydney.' - The member for Grayndler said:But it is not the heroin per se that causes all these problems, it is often the criminalisation of the supply and use of heroin.And we have the member for Lalor, who said through her spokesman:If state governments make that decision - that is to say, the decision to support injecting rooms - ... then we'd back them.It is possible that all of these opposition frontbenchers have changed their mind. But unless they are prepared to publicly repudiate -  - The quote from the member for Grayndler was from the House Hansard of 22 March 1999, so can we table some of these? The truth is that, unless these frontbenchers opposite have changed their opinions and publicly put on the record their changed opinions, there is only one conclusion to be drawn, and that is that Labor is soft on drugs. Labor is soft on drugs. And then there are the preference deals -  -  -  - I simply make the point in conclusion - ... if an accusation is made against members ... would be unparliamentary and offensive, it is in the interests of the comity of this House that it should not be made against all as it could not be made against one.It then goes on to say:This practice has been followed by succeeding Speakers.In my view it should be followed by you and the minister for health should have to withdraw that remark.... offensive words must be offensive in the true meaning of that word. When a man - and I would add 'or woman' - is in political life it is not offensive that things are said about him politically. -  - In conclusion, I want to say that I welcome any support for policies that are tough on drugs from members opposite. I welcome it and, if the member for Grayndler, the member for Sydney, the member for Lalor and the Leader of the Opposition are prepared to withdraw their support for heroin injecting rooms, I would give them a great deal of credit and congratulate them. I call on them to withdraw their support for heroin injecting rooms.</DOC>

 - The RBA cited its reasons when it made its most recent announcements. The reasons were the strength of the global economy and demand in the Australian economy, particularly pointing at credit growth. It did not say anything about skills. I notice that there is a habit in the Labor Party of misrepresenting what people say. Nobody could have given a clearer example of that than the member for Grayndler in the question that he asked the Prime Minister earlier today. At an appropriate time, I will be making an explanation to show how he completely misled the House in the question he asked earlier.Let me just conclude this point on this note. I sat in this House for six years in opposition and I can tell members of the House that never once in those six years did I hear anything about labour shortages, and I will tell you why. The Labor Party had 11 per cent unemployment. As far as problems go, it is much better to have jobs chasing workers than workers chasing jobs. The coalition is the party of employment; Labor stands for recession and unemployment. We now have a situation whereby we have the lowest unemployment in 30 years and that is because only the coalition can manage the Australian economy.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his very strong commitment to border protection, particularly in the north end of Australia. There is no more important task undertaken by the Royal Australian Navy than the protection of Australia's borders. Having had the privilege of being able to spend a night on HMAS Bathurst, I can attest to the professionalism and commitment of the Royal Australian Navy in this task.In the most recent budget, the government announced a further $380 million investment over the next four years in further strengthening Australia's border protection. At the moment, as far as our Royal Australian Navy is concerned, we have one major fleet unit, an FFG, at the Top End. We also currently have five Armidale class patrol boats which we will build up to seven. We have brought back two minehunters, which will also support them in that task, and a PC3 Orion surveillance aircraft. All of that complements the very important assets, dedication and commitment of Australian Customs and other agencies which we have brought together under one single operation called Operation Resolute. We also now have a border security central command which coordinates all the efforts of Australia's enforcement agencies in protecting Australian borders. I recently announced, in addition to that, a billion dollar investment in developing a multimissioned, unmanned aerial vehicle and we are working with the United States Navy to develop that for state-of-the-art surveillance across our maritime borders.I think many Australians are aware of the Channel 7 program Border Security. In May this year, it aired a program which featured HMAS Warrnambool. We saw a Royal Australian Navy patrol boat coming alongside an ice boat, a foreign vessel fishing illegally in Australian waters. The first thing that this foreign fishing vessel met was a Navy vessel. The first thing the XO of the ship said over a megaphone, accompanied by another sailor holding a firearm, was, 'This is an Australian warship.' Following that, rounds were fired from a 50 calibre machine gun and a boarding party went aboard that foreign fishing vessel.There are others who are critical of this policy and approach to border protection. The Australian Labor Party has proposed a coastguard, which is really a coast guide. That means that in five years the Labor Party has had five policies on this and it is very difficult to understand exactly what it is on about. In fact, if you have any doubt about this, when presenting evidence against handling a coastguard to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in 2001 the Navy said that the creation of a coastguard would have a detrimental effect on Navy training and experience. That is Navyspeak for gutting Australia's Navy.But of perhaps more interest is that the CFMEU journal Common Cause in October that year said of the creation of an Australian coastguard: 'It would be manned by members of the Maritime Union.' So Australians have a choice. The choice that Australians have is that they have the Royal Australian Navy picking up those who want to breach Australian sovereignty and presenting them with the full force of the Navy in securing and protecting our borders or they have a coastguard of indeterminate cost which would gut the Royal Australian Navy and be manned by civilians who would be fully unionised.I have also directed the Chief of Navy to review the rules of engagement and the amount of force which can be used by the Royal Australian Navy against those who want to come here and steal our fish or illegally come to Australia. I might also point out that the choice Australians will have next year, when the election comes, is between a government that is strong in the parliament and strong on the borders, and a Beazley led government with a white flag on the parliament and a white flag on our borders.</DOC>

 - First of all, I notice that the Queensland Labor Party is not too proud to take funding from AWB Ltd for the state election campaign. I just thought I might mention that. - Secondly, this includes the member for Griffith, no doubt. He is not too proud to take AWB's money. But this was clearly a reference -  - I refer the honourable member to the Australian newspaper - I would not refer the Leader of the Opposition to the Australian newspaper because he does not read it - of February 2006. The member for Ryan drew my attention to it. I would have to refresh my memory in relation to the specific record of conversation, but I can assure the House of this: that was not a reference to the Australian government knowing during the relevant period that AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime.But the Cole inquiry is continuing its investigation and hopefully its report will be produced relatively soon. What is more, in recent days - or in recent weeks, in any case - a series of documents has been released through the Cole inquiry, so-called confessional documents from AWB Ltd. If anybody cares to read those documents, and I suspect not many members of the House would and certainly the Leader of the Opposition would not bother -  - they will see that by AWB's own admission it had not been informing the government of any activities in relation to paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime. But one final point - because I am glad the honourable member asked the question - is that we on this side of the House were always in favour of getting rid of Saddam Hussein's regime. You on that side of the House wanted to keep him there and allow these rorts to continue indefinitely.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know that as a former economics and history teacher he is very interested in this issue. The teaching of Australian history in our schools has been downgraded. In fact, in a number of schools it is not even an optional extra. I announced recently that I would be hosting a summit to find ways to strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools, and that summit will be held in Canberra tomorrow. I have invited leading historians and public figures who are supporting the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I invited education leaders and teachers, including the President of the History Teachers Association of Australia. Eminent historians John Hirst, Inga Clendinnen and Geoffrey Blainey will be in attendance, and Bob Carr, the former Labor Premier from New South Wales, will also be in attendance.We on this side of the House believe it is time for a renaissance in the teaching of Australian history. Students need to know more about our national story. If they can better understand the past, they will be more informed citizens of the future. The summit will focus on what is currently being taught and how and on what should be taught and why. Yes, I have written to all state and territory education ministers seeking their input. I have not had a response from any except the minister in the ACT. Tomorrow, we will pursue the strengthening of Australian history in our schools. I want to work collaboratively with the state and territory governments and with education authorities to ensure that Australian history is a key component in every school curriculum. I was astonished to read in the Australian newspaper - The member for Denison then left the chamber. - I was saying that what we are seeking to do is strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I was astonished to read in the Australian newspaper - admittedly, it was the Australian, so the Leader of the Opposition will not have read this national newspaper - an article on 6 July headed 'Beazley against history revival'. It reads:KIM Beazley has dismissed the push ... to reinstate the teaching of traditional Australian history in schools as an 'elite preoccupation'.I ask the Leader of the Opposition: what is elite about learning about our diggers at Gallipoli? What is elite about learning of the struggles of our early settlers? What is elite about the establishment of a liberal democracy in this country? - How could the Leader of the Opposition seek to politicise even the acquisition of knowledge about our nation's history?</DOC>

 - My understanding is that Ms Goward has been reappointed. I will check with the Attorney-General as to the Executive Council and subsequent processes on whether there has been an announcement made. My understanding is that a person who is in a situation such as Pru Goward's is entitled to seek political endorsement and is entitled to retain -  - hang on - his or her position until such time, if they are successful in the preselection, as nominations are called. My recollection, for example, is that the former Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth, Bob Ellicott, contested the preselection for Berowra. He was unsuccessful in the preselection. So was I, incidentally. I remember the preselection very well. He did not have to resign his position as Solicitor-General in order to contest the Liberal Party preselection. The basis of the argument of the member for Gellibrand is that we are trying to preserve a sinecure for somebody while they contest a political preselection. Just for the information of the honourable member: I am completely neutral in the preselection. I am not supporting anybody.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I think members will be aware he is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and at the moment they are examining the nuclear safeguards agreement that we have negotiated with China, so he has a real understanding of these issues. In answer to the honourable member's question, let me say that Australia is at the forefront of international efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials that could be used in weapons systems and to ban weapons testing.As the foreign affairs minister, I introduced into the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 the comprehensive test ban treaty, which was adopted by the General Assembly. We in Australia have the world's most rigorous uranium export safeguards - and with 40 per cent of the world's known exploitable and commercially available uranium it is important we do. Australia is a very active member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and also of the International Atomic Energy Agency. No country has a more diligent record than Australia. As the House and the honourable members know, the Prime Minister has commissioned a review of uranium mining and processing and nuclear energy, and I think this is a responsible thing to do so that we can have a serious debate about these issues.There has been some criticism, in particular from the Leader of the Opposition, who said on the ABC on 24 July:I'm not going to move to support enrichment and nuclear power because I think that's the policy of an idiot ...I would draw the House's attention to the fact that France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and many other countries in the world use nuclear energy, so the suggestion that somehow these countries are run by idiots or have the policies of idiots is, I would have thought, a bizarre thing for the Leader of the Opposition, who aspires to be the Prime Minister, to say. He said on the same day to the Sydney Institute - and this was, after all, in a written speech - that our consideration of these nuclear issues:... sends the wrong message to the region. There is no question that Australia would be less secure, and not more, if our neighbours believe we have nuclear ambitions.I do not think that is actually a responsible thing to say. This country does not, of course, have nuclear weapons ambitions, and everybody in the region knows it. To suggest that a country which is considering issues like nuclear power is also considering nuclear weapons and that others in the region would think that is, to say the least, utterly absurd. Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia all either have nuclear energy programs or at least are considering them.The simple fact is that the people of Australia deserve to have a more mature debate on these sorts of issues than those kinds of statements suggest. I certainly think that it is quite the wrong thing to drum up antagonism towards this country in the region just in order to make a political point.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform him that in 2004 the government set up Project Wickenby, a project funded with $300 million to investigate international tax evasion and tax fraud. This dedicated operation brings together the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Crime Commission, the DPP, the Australian Federal Police and AUSTRAC. Under the investigation to date, three people have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and assets have been frozen in relation to persons of interest.The international scams which are being investigated under Project Wickenby have the capacity to threaten the integrity of the Australian taxation system. Today I am announcing that the government will introduce legislation to enable the agencies involved in Project Wickenby to share information between themselves which will assist in bringing successful prosecutions. These prosecutions will be not just in the tax area but in other areas, including money laundering.Separately but related to that I am announcing a larger project to review the laws that protect taxpayer secrecy and disclosure between various agencies of government. This project will be commenced with the release of a discussion paper looking at existing secrecy and disclosure provisions from around 30 tax acts and proposing to standardise them in a way which will clarify the operation of the provisions and provide increased certainty for taxpayers and tax officials. This is part of a program which is continuing to simplify the operation of Australia's taxation laws.In relation to Project Wickenby, I can inform the House that this government will adequately fund and see through that investigation into international tax evasion, which this government will not countenance and which, if it were left unchecked, would undermine the Australian taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. The member for Page would be well aware of the great export earning effort that is being contributed to by the education sector, given that Southern Cross University is in Lismore in his electorate and has other campuses along the mid-North Coast of New South Wales.In 2005-06 the return to Australia from education exports hit a record figure of $8 billion, rising 13 per cent on the previous year. That $8 billion earned for the Australian economy was through the export of education services delivered both onshore and offshore, in person and through the internet. Education services are now our fourth largest export earner - hitting a record - one of the top four export earners in 2005-06. It is an extraordinary result. It has been achieved not just by the universities in Australia - as I indicated, Southern Cross University is in the electorate of the member for Page - but by other educational institutions also exporting their services to the world.Over the last 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in export earnings from education - in fact, a 320 per cent increase. In 1996 export earnings from the education sector were only $2.5 billion. They have now risen to $8 billion. As I say, it is our fourth largest export earner. Australian universities now have enrolments from students from more than 160 countries across the globe. It is helping to build a larger critical mass in our universities in Australia. In 2005, enrolments from China alone passed 81,000 students, and enrolments of students from India grew 33 per cent to 27,500. These exports growing in key markets are not only producing export income; part of this process is developing key cross-cultural ties with many countries across the world. Offshore students being educated in Australian universities go on to be business leaders and political leaders in those countries. It stands Australia in good stead in terms of the relationship between ourselves and many of our near neighbours.Labor says it wants to establish world-class universities in Australia. We already have them. Those students coming to Australia to get their education here are voting with their feet. They are flocking to Australian universities. So not only have we expanded our base of education export services in Australia but we are also providing a lot more education places in our universities for Australian students. We are building critical mass in our education system in Australia, particularly in our universities, and at the same time creating many more jobs in the Australian economy through our exports.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his interest in jobs for young Australians. I can inform him that the teenage full-time unemployment to population ratio, which refers to the proportion of the total teenage population unemployed and looking for full-time work, declined to just 4.4 per cent in July, which is well below the peak of 10.1 per cent which was recorded in July 1992, when the Leader of the Opposition was then the Australian employment minister.In 1996, the Leader of the Opposition told young Australians that the Howard government's workplace reforms would 'put young Australians at a disadvantage'. The reality is just the opposite. What they have done is provide greater opportunities for young Australians to get into the workforce - as shown by the fall from 10.1 per cent to 4.4 per cent. Not much has changed in 10 years, because, 10 years later, the Leader of the Opposition is still trying to scaremonger amongst young workers about workplace reform. He has said:Mums and dads know that John Howard's industrial relations laws are throwing their children to the wolves.Again, the data reveals that that is just not the case. The member for Bonner also asked me whether there are any attempts to mislead young Australians on these matters. I came across an interesting new curriculum which is being propagated by the labour movement, particularly in New South Wales, for teachers to deliver to their students. The content of these union lessons to be delivered, which are on their website, is quite concerning. For example, there is an activity that says:Teacher roleplays with students. As the call-centre employer teacher begins to change the conditions of work by setting time limits or quotas on simple tasks. Students complete tasks and teacher pressures them. Conflict is created.So the union movement's idea of industrial relations, what they are saying to teachers and students through this curriculum, is: 'We should go out there and create conflict.' That is the union movement's idea of industrial relations. There is another case study on this website which is teaching students to become xenophobic by teaching them to fear having their jobs go to foreign workers. This is a curriculum promoted by the union movement for students in our schools, from years 7 to 10. Why are the labour movement and the Labor Party promoting xenophobia amongst students in our secondary schools in Australia?As the data which I used at the outset of this question illustrates, the reforms of both 1996 and this year are actually about creating more jobs for young Australians and putting protections in there for Australians. The Leader of the Opposition and the unions are more concerned with and focused on filling young Australians with fear rather than with facts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question, and I do appreciate that he is asking it on his own behalf and, in effect, on behalf of the member for Dawson as well. I appreciate that the member for Hinkler has seen at close quarters the human damage that can be inflicted by a secretive and coercive culture in health institutions. When allegations were made of surgical incompetence at Bundaberg Hospital, the whistleblowers were ridiculed and vilified but ultimately vindicated by a royal commission.Now the member for Dawson has made allegations of serious misconduct at Mackay Base Hospital based on information provided to her by credible health professionals. Today I have written to the Queensland health minister asking him to establish a full, open and independent inquiry into these allegations. The member for Dawson, in two speeches to this House, has claimed that an underqualified surgeon worked at Mackay Base Hospital without supervision, that the hospital knew that this doctor was working without the required supervision, that at least 10 patients had botched operations performed on them by this underqualified surgeon working without proper supervision and that staff complaining about this have been subject to bullying and harassment.I stress that these are allegations - albeit allegations based on evidence provided by credible people. I do not want to prejudge this matter, but there is a very serious problem when potential misconduct is swept under the carpet by a secretive and coercive health structure. This matter does need to be investigated, and an investigation should not be put off until after the election, if confidence in the Queensland public hospital system is to be maintained. In my letter to the Queensland minister, I have suggested a means by which an inquiry could be expedited. This is a serious matter and it does deserve urgent attention. I table my letter to the Queensland health minister.</DOC>

 - Let me explain that, very obviously, there was no collusion over several years by the government in relation to the AWB, nor has there been an attempt by the government to cover up. I would have thought - and I might be wrong - that something like 60 days worth of public hearings by the Cole commission, including substantial interviews, cross-examinations and examinations of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - which, if the Leader of the Opposition chose, he may wish to read - would have revealed precisely what the department knew, what it did not know, what it did do and what it did not do. The Minister for Trade appeared before the commission, and I myself spent around four hours before the Cole commission answering questions. The Prime Minister did likewise.The opposition asked questions on this topic on every single day - I think almost without exception - for the first three months of this year. We have been exhaustive in providing information. When the Cole commission endeavoured to get still further information from AWB Ltd, we have gone so far as to not only set up the Cole commission so that an independent commission can get to the heart of this matter but even amend legislation to facilitate his access to documentation. - The suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition, who obviously did not follow the hearings of the Cole commission -  - No, you did not. You are too lazy to follow something like that. You are a lazy, idle man who has not followed it, and you do not know your job. You would not have asked a silly question like that if you had been following the Cole commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for the question and recognise his particular interest in major road projects in Queensland, like the Ipswich Motorway and the Goodna bypass, for which he has been a champion over recent years. The Australian government has been working diligently to endeavour to get some of these projects up and running so that the people of Queensland can benefit from the $3 billion that this government has committed to Queensland for road and rail infrastructure under the AusLink program.Unfortunately, the Queensland government continue to dither and procrastinate while the cost of all these projects just goes through the roof. The Queensland government, for instance, keep demanding that the Australian government allocate more money for the Ipswich Motorway. We have provided $556 million under AusLink already and they demand more. The reality is that, at the end of June this year, of that $556 million -  - that is available to the Queensland government, they had spent only $58 million - that is, only $58 million out of the $556 million. - Yet they run a campaign demanding the Australian government contribute more. Of course, there will be a lot more work to be done on that project.The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - It is a disappointment the member for Oxley is not available to hear something about the failure of the Queensland government to get on with an important construction job in his electorate, because the reality is this is an important project which this government is committed to and for which it has been prepared to provide financial resources.A little further north, I have reported to the House on a number of occasions on our efforts to upgrade the Bruce Highway and the significant commitment that has been made to planning for new routes to make four-lanes on the highway between Curra and Cooroy, only to find out after a year and a half on the job that the Queensland government has decided to flood nine kilometres of the road - not build new dams on the sites that have already been acquired but instead flood some of the existing highway.This is typical of the lack of planning and foresight of the Queensland Labor government. They sat by while the population of south-east Queensland grew - they boasted about it - but there are no plans to provide the adequate infrastructure. In addition to that, it took a water restriction on the rose garden at Parliament House before they actually realised that the state was in 10 years of drought and was running out of water. This is the kind of incompetent planning of infrastructure that makes up the alternative policies of Labor in Queensland.The determination of the Queensland government to always blame the federal government for all its troubles is quite extraordinary. The members representing Gold Coast seats would be well aware of the campaign and literature being distributed by Mr Lucas, the minister for transport in Queensland. He is always happy to take credit when federal government money is being provided for a state job, but when the funding is not to his satisfaction he blames the federal government for not having funded Queensland government roads and sends circulars out to everybody that say: 'This road can't go ahead because the Australian government haven't provided funding for a road that is actually their responsibility.' This is typical of a government that has lost sight of its objectives and the reason for governments to provide infrastructure and planning. We will get on with the job. A change of government in Queensland would make a real difference to delivery of infrastructure in that state.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and acknowledge her interest in the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I can report to the House that the Prime Minister opened the Australian History Summit today in Parliament House. There are 23 participants in this summit, ranging from eminent historians and teachers to educators and curriculum developers. The summit participants will be providing advice to the Australian government on how we can strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools.During the opening this morning, the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government will be contributing $100,000 annually for a Prime Minister's Australian history prize. This substantial amount will be for a substantial work: a book, a film or a documentary. As it is an annual prize, we hope that it will attract not only historians and teachers but also the broader community. This prize highlights the government's commitment to ensuring that Australian history is taught, and taught properly, in our schools. The member for Mackellar asks me if there are other views. This morning the member for Lilley, referring to the Australian History Summit, said it was 'all about spreading mass confusion'. - I am afraid so, Prime Minister - that is what the member for Lilley said. It seems that the only confusion on this issue is in fact on the Labor side of the House. A few months ago, it was reported in the Canberra Times that 'students needed to be taught the narrative history of this country .' The Prime Minister could have said that, but indeed it was the Leader of the Opposition who said that. A few months ago the Leader of the Opposition was saying that students needed to be taught the narrative history of this country and yet, a few months later, Beazley was 'against the history revival' and in fact dismissed the teaching of traditional Australian history in schools as an 'elite preoccupation'. So while there is clearly confusion on the part of the Leader of the Opposition - and the Australian public are entitled to be confused about where he stands on this and many other issues - I can assure Australian parents that I will be listening to the advice from the summit participants and that I will be working with education authorities to ensure that the teaching of Australian history takes its rightful place in Australian schools.</DOC>

 - In answer to the question from the honourable member for Perth, Qantas is doing what the government wants it to do - that is, creating jobs for Australians. What the opposition does not seem to understand is that Qantas, through the Jetstar subsidiary, just in the last week has created 200 new jobs for Australians. In this debate, the one word you will never uttered hear from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition is 'jobs'. When did anybody in Australia last hear the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party talk about jobs? To quote Mr Dixon, the CEO of Qantas:We have created jobs, unlike just about every other airline in the world. We can continue to create jobs if we can change the way we operate further, and we are going to do that.This government supports Mr Dixon and Qantas in creating jobs.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Happy to, any time, mate. - Well, that's fixed him! I thank the member for Bowman for his question and also for his interest in ensuring that Australia's economy continues to grow. In its climate change policy this government has the balance right between lowering emissions and maintaining economic growth. Companies like Xstrata, for instance, have benefited from that policy. Xstrata not only is the biggest exporter of coal in Australia but pays almost $1 billion in taxes, earns billions of dollars in exports and employs 5,000 people in the coal industry and some 3,000 people in the base metals industry, all of whose jobs would be in danger if the policies of those opposite and of their counterparts at a state level in regard to emissions trading were adopted.Yesterday the states launched their plans for an emissions trading scheme, which by their own admission will increase the price of electricity and drive Australian industry, jobs and investment offshore. But don't take my word for it - let us listen to what some Australian organisations have said. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have said that the states' proposal will 'reduce the international competitiveness of our strongest industries'. They go on to say: 'On just about any rational policy measure it's a failure, and more about political symbolism than achieving real results.' There are even those in the Labor Party who would agree with that.The Premier of Western Australia has rejected the scheme outright, saying it raises 'a number of concerns for WA, including the possible impact on the WA economy and electricity costs for WA consumers'. In Queensland, Premier Beattie is trying to walk both sides of the street. In one breath he has described Australia's emissions as 'chickenfeed' and yet in the same breath he has not committed Queensland either to supporting the scheme or to opposing the scheme. It is about time Peter Beattie stopped walking both sides of the street and was honest with Queenslanders about putting Australia's interests first and about putting their jobs first. Any concerns state premiers may have will be swept aside if the Leader of the Opposition ever gets into power and puts in place his emission trading scheme. It will not only slow economic growth; it will increase the price of electricity and petrol and cost Australians jobs.</DOC>

The reality is that the solutions to lowering Australia's emissions and lowering the world's emissions lie in technology. That is the policy that this government has adopted. - The Labor Party is quite happy to trade away the jobs of Australians in pursuit of an idealistic policy. This government will never trade away Australian jobs. We will always find practical solutions that lower greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. It is a sad reality today that there are too many young Australians who are inappropriately being housed in aged care facilities. These are people who, through either disease or accidents, find themselves in an aged care facility simply because there is no appropriate place for a young person to get the care they need in a safe environment.The fact is that the housing of people with disabilities, under the disability agreement, is a state responsibility. But back in February, due to the leadership of the Howard government and particularly the Prime Minister, the federal government signed an agreement in the COAG process allocating $244 million to this particular cause of removing young people from aged care facilities and housing them in appropriate accommodation that will meet their lifestyle needs.This is an important initiative, and today I can inform the House that three of the states have now signed direct bilaterals with the federal government. For the information of honourable members, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland have done so, and negotiations are under way with two other states. Can I suggest to the other states that are still discussing this matter - this is the most polite way I can do it - that an aged care facility is not an appropriate place for a young person to be and we should all be making every effort to honour the agreement that was made in February to have these young people removed.I took the step, along with the states, of advertising throughout Australia back on 15 July for expressions of interest on appropriate ways to house people in these various circumstances. We have been overwhelmed by the response that we have had from individuals, community organisations and care groups. In fact I have had over 140 inquiries thus far, and some very innovative approaches have been brought forward.The aim of this initiative is to ensure that we move young people with a disability into appropriate residential care, to help those who wish to remain in an aged care facility for various reasons to have the appropriate level of care provided to them and also to assist those who are not in an aged care facility to be able to remain in appropriate care. This does require everybody's effort. It requires the states to work with us to ensure that we meet our objectives of having fewer young people in aged care facilities and that they are housed in an appropriate form of care, recognising their needs as Australians who should be able to have a full life expectancy that otherwise they are denied when they are put in inappropriate circumstances in aged care facilities. - The member for Lilley must be short of sight; I hardly read a thing, Mr Speaker.

 - I am aware of the story in the Sydney Morning Herald but I am not in a position to verify the accuracy of the various claims made. Obviously if those claims are true they are alarming, and the practice should be condemned by everybody. I can inform the House that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs issued a Hunan industrial company which is contracted to erect a tissue paper machine at ABC Tissues in Sydney with a notice of intention to apply sanctions on a number of grounds, including failing to pay the minimum salary level, comply with immigration laws, comply with workplace relations laws, ensure necessary licensing of workers, notify DIMA of relevant changes of circumstances and deduct tax instalments. On 16 August, the department sent a notice of intention to ABC Tissues on the grounds that two 457 visa holders were not carrying out the duties of the nominated positions. Their response was received on 1 September and is being reviewed by the department. Referrals on these matters have also been made to a number of New South Wales government agencies, the Office of Workplace Services and the Australian Taxation Office. These agencies have the authority to sanction within the terms of their own legislation. Subject to the determination of these other agencies, the department may take further action as appropriate.I think it is worth informing the House, whilst generally talking on the issue of 457 visas, that as of January 2006 the largest single user of these visas was the New South Wales department of health, and state governments are actively involved in the process through their role in regional certifying bodies. Most recently, the Western Australian government wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs seeking an urgent skilled labour agreement to allow it to sponsor temporary skilled meatworkers to enter Western Australia to meet an urgent unmet demand in abattoirs in that state. This government is happy to work with Western Australia to ensure that those visitors can work to full capacity for the benefit of the whole community. This government supports - as do the eight state and territory Labor governments - the 457 system. We do, however, unconditionally condemn breaches. Any breaches will be severely dealt with and heavily prosecuted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. When the government reformed the tax system in 2000 and introduced the GST, it was to replace wholesale sales tax and nine inefficient state taxes. Since its introduction, the GST has delivered to the states, cumulatively, $187 billion in GST revenue. No state has done better than the state of Queensland, where the member for Bonner comes from. Over the next four years, the GST is expected to deliver to the states, over and above what they were guaranteed, $12½ billion. That is over and above what they were guaranteed, which was a rising base anyway - $12½ billion.Unfortunately, whilst we now have an agreement from the states to abolish eight of those taxes, the states still refuse to abolish stamp duty on business conveyances. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the GST is designed to replace nine state taxes, and the Commonwealth will insist in the interests of taxpayers that nine state taxes are abolished. At the same time that the states have had massive windfalls in GST revenue, in some states they have been actually increasing stamp duties on conveyancing, as they did in Queensland on 1 July 2006. Listen to this: in June 2000, stamp duty on the median house in Brisbane was $3,859. In June 2006, stamp duty on the median house price was $10,347. Even worse, in the highest stamp duty taxed state in Australia, Victoria, in June 2000, stamp duty on the median house was $8,009. In June 2006 - this is the median house - it was $16,806. So you would get your first home owners grant and it would cover about half of your stamp duty bill in Victoria. You would get your first home owners grant and it would cover about 70 per cent of your stamp duty bill in the state of Queensland.I noticed on the weekend that the Queensland coalition leader has announced a policy to reduce stamp duty and eventually eliminate it. It is about time that state governments were held accountable for the stamp duty windfall. It is about time that the buyers of homes got a fair go. It is about time that the Labor governments, which have been swimming in GST revenue, did something about their stamp duties. This policy is to be commended as an indication on behalf of the state coalition, on behalf of the Queensland people, to deal with stamp duty duties, which have not been cut, nor have they been indexed, but they have become extremely high and are punishing homebuyers in Australia.</DOC>

 - Without looking at the details of the 457 visas, I can neither confirm nor deny what has been put to me. But nothing in that alters our support for the scheme -  - and of course nothing alters the absolute essentiality for people who come here who do not speak English. I take this opportunity of making the point - which is not what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was inferring in her question - that I am not suggesting for moment that everybody who comes to this country should be able to speak the English language when they arrive. I have never suggested that. What I have suggested is that, if people come to this country with an imperfect knowledge of English, they have a heavy obligation to learn it and to learn it as soon as possible, because it is a passport to success. - It is a passport to success in this country, and I am grateful that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me that question so I have the opportunity of repeating what I said last week: that one of the essential passports to achievement in this country is to learn the English language. Whether or not you can speak the English language when you come here is beside the point. It is the speed with which you learn it and your commitment to learning it that are important, and I stand by everything I said last week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I note in answering it that the unemployment rate in Dobell is almost half of what it was in 1996, when it stood at the disastrous level of 11.6 per cent when the Labor Party left government.Since the introduction of Work Choices we have seen record jobs growth in Australia. A total of 159,000 jobs have been created in Australia from March to July this year. This certainly destroys the claim made by the Labor movement that Work Choices would be a green light for slashing jobs. Indeed, just the opposite has occurred in Australia. In March this year the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, was asked by John Laws on radio:You don't agree that these changes would provide any sort of jobs growth?Mr Combet replied:Oh, I can't see it.I ask him to take off the blinkers and look at the 159,000 jobs that have been created in Australia in the last few months. And let us put this in context: that is double the number of jobs created in Australia for the same period of last year.If one takes a 20-year average, if you look at the last 20 years, average job growth in Australia over those same months was just 51,000 jobs. So here we have a trebling of the 20-year average jobs growth from March through to July. Why is this? Partly it is because Australian employers have been freed of one of the monkeys on their back in the past - Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Creating workplace arrangement which suit the needs of both employers and employees and simplifying the workplace relations system - all of these things - have made it easier for employers to create jobs in Australia.We have seen massive jobs growth in the last few months. But, on top of that, wages have also continued to grow. Indeed the June 2006 quarter data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicates an annual growth rate in wages of 4.1 per cent. So not only has there not been a slashing of jobs as predicted by the labour movement and not only has there not been a driving down of wages as predicted by the labour movement but in fact there has been a massive creation of jobs and a growth in wages in this country, so much so that the unemployment rate has reached a 30-year low of 4.8 per cent and wages are up.Against this empirical data which is now available for people to assess Work Choices, we still have the Leader of the Opposition running around Australia and saying that he will rip up these laws. What would that do? That would disadvantage hundreds of thousands of Australian workers and their families who have already benefited from these changes over the last few months. If you take one sector of industry alone in Australia, the mining and resources sector, it has been estimated that simply the policy of abolishing Australian workplace agreements would cost $6.4 billion in lost productivity, and of course jobs and wages would equally be at jeopardy under that system. There is only one description for what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do in Australia, and that is economic vandalism. It would kill productivity in Australia and it would place in jeopardy the economic security of hundreds of thousands of Australians.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is as I indicated in answer to the Leader of the Opposition. The department is taking action in relation to alleged breaches. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is asking the House to accept is that a total scheme is completely discredited because one or two companies try to rort it. We are investigating the claims. When the results of that investigation are known, further information will be made available or further action will be taken. But do I still support the scheme? Yes. So do the eight state and territory Labor leaders. They all support it, and they are up to their armpits in using it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The member for Hinkler represents a part of the north coast of Queensland that is an exporting engine room of Queensland. One of the industries up there which is a home-grown manufacturing industry is Jabiru Aircraft. They export right across the world to about 31 countries. The member for Hinkler is a great supporter of that industry.In answer to the member's question, Australia's manufactured exports increased in value terms by 12 per cent in 2005-06 to a record $39.5 billion. Figures released by the ABS on Friday show that in volume terms manufactured exports rose by 6.4 per cent. So they rose in value terms and in volume terms in the last financial year. Some of the manufactured exports to rise in the last financial year in dollar terms are quite significant. Aluminium, for example, is up by 28 per cent to a record $4.8 billion. Motor vehicles, where exports increased by 14 per cent, are up to a record $3.1 billion. Medicines rose 18 per cent to a record $3 billion. They are all very important sectors in the Australian manufacturing industry base that are generating with that growth many jobs for Australians.The outlook for manufactured exports and the manufacturing industry is positive. The Australian Industry Group August survey shows that manufacturing activity is continuing to grow, partly driven by the increase in exports and the expectation of an increase in exports in that sector. The government have continued to support the manufacturing industries in Australia and particularly their competitiveness in the international marketplace. For example, we removed the three per cent tariff on imported inputs, where there are no domestically produced substitutes, to make the outputs, the manufactured products, more competitive in the international marketplace.We should never forget that in the tax reforms we introduced a number of years ago, under A New Tax System, we removed $3 billion worth of taxes off the back of Australian exports. It is good to recognise that in the current political debate in Queensland another coalition is offering to further enhance the competitiveness and the cost structure of business by offering to phase out and remove stamp duty for that sector in Queensland. It would be a good thing if every state in Australia followed suit to work with the federal government to increase the competitiveness and the viability of businesses, particularly manufacturing businesses. The coalition will continue to encourage business to help strengthen its base in the domestic economy and be more competitive on the international stage.</DOC>

 - Can I just say to the member for Lalor, who is trying to establish that my Treasurer and my finance minister have been incompetent, that they are fellows who have presided over a golden age of economic growth in Australia. To say that they are incompetent - you really should take a reality check. That is what the member for Lalor should do. But it is worse. I think the member for Lalor has misrepresented the position. - The Treasurer tells me that she has, and I tell you what: I believe what the Treasurer tells me. I really do. If I had to choose between the member for Lalor and the Treasurer I know who I would choose. Let me make it very clear: I thought that yesterday both the Treasurer and the finance minister talked a lot of sense about Medibank Private - so much so that when I was asked a question about it on Brisbane radio this morning I said that I agreed with them. - I think the idea of the Australian public being able to buy shares in a privatised Medibank Private would be a good thing. I think it would aid competition and I think people would be interested in it. If there could be a margin for the members of Medibank Private in the arrangement, I think that would be a good thing too. That is all I have to say at the moment, but if I find out anything more about whether the member for Lalor has misled the House you will understand my returning to the dispatch box.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. It is nice to get a question in this chamber, because one does not get too many questions from the shadow minister. The member for Braddon is locally known as 'the member for Medicare', given that the GP bulk-billing rates in the electorate of Braddon have increased by no fewer than 25 percentage points since December 2003. Then of course there are all the other good things he is doing for the health of his electorate, such as the $7.75 million aged care facility that he has just announced at Circular Head, in his electorate.I can inform the House that, in the June quarter, the GP bulk-billing rate in this country increased to 76.6 per cent. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of higher GP bulk-billing rates. The bulk-billing rate has now increased by 10.1 percentage points since December 2003. The overall bulk-billing rate - that is to say, GPs and specialists - now stands at 72.3 per cent compared - and I say this to the member for Grayndler - with just 71.1 per cent in March 1996.Bulk-billing is not the be all and end all of Medicare, but it is important. It should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners, and that is just what is happening thanks to the policies of the Howard government. The bulk-billing rate for children was 83.8 per cent in the June quarter. It is at an all-time high. The bulk-billing rate in country areas, 71.3 per cent in the June quarter, is also at a new record high. In February 2004 the member for Lalor said that Medicare was 'haemorrhaging'. It was 'losing blood', she said. 'It is dying,' she said. I can advise her that, since then, the bulk-billing rate in her electorate has increased by over 10 percentage points to 80.5 per cent. Thanks to the policies of this government, Medicare is stronger than ever and the Howard government is most definitely the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. The honourable member for Herbert well knows how devastating -  -  - The member for Herbert well knows the devastation of Cyclone Larry to northern Queensland communities -  - and the northern banana industry. He knows that the government's commitment was that our strict quarantine requirements would not be compromised -  - to meet any domestic shortfall. That commitment has been met in full by the government. Trading on people's suffering and misery is the lowest act of a politician, and the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier have been doing exactly that over the last couple of days. Even as late as this morning at his doorstop, he was telling hard-pressed and fearful banana growers of north Queensland and their associated industry that they would suffer further loss because of the government reneging on its promise. They have made allegations of broken promises, of increased competition and quarantine laxness - all of it untrue. Let us not beat about the bush: Labor were peddling lies and the evidence of that is that there is no question on the bananas today. We are halfway through question time and there is not a single question from Labor - and I am hopeful there might be some. - This is my challenge to the Labor Party: ask some of these banana questions. No, you have gone out there, you have distorted the truth, you have reaped what political -  - opportunities you could, and now you will stay silent. You do not have the courage of your convictions and the simple fact is that the commitment was met. The best adjudicator of this is the Banana Growers Council itself. The banana council believes 'the frozen banana importation is not a breach of the Prime Minister's commitment given to growers at Innisfail after Cyclone Larry'. - We have had this mock outrage from the Labor Party. Guess who started importing pulped and diced bananas? The Labor Party, of course. For many years Australia has imported processed banana product, so I thought I would check some facts - something those opposite chose not to do. Between 1993 and 1996, the amount of processed bananas that the Labor Party allowed into the country was 140 tonnes. They are complaining about the 11 tonnes of processed bananas but they let in 140 tonnes from countries such as Vietnam, Fiji, Tonga, Taiwan, Sri Lanka and the like. - And the member for Corio, the departing agriculture spokesman, interjects. Even in a radio interview today he was saying that this pulped and processed banana would be used in restaurants - completely false. This is another distortion of the truth. It is quite obvious that the Labor Party is as lacking in political morality and honesty as it is lacking in policy.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I have not. The answer to the second part of the question - have I breached their trust, or have I gone back on a promise? - is no. In support of that denial, I refer to no better authority than the Australia Banana Growers Council. It said:The large volume of frozen banana brought into Australia from Vietnam has taken the Australian Banana Growers' Council by surprise but it does not believe this is a breach of the commitment given by the Prime Minister regarding fresh green banana imports.Quite frankly, I know it is election time in Queensland. In response to the cyclone in Far North Queensland, the federal government to date has poured - as it should have, and I support the expenditure to the hard-pressed people of Far North Queensland of every single dollar I am about to quote - $249 million of assistance into that community, and the amount contributed, so I am advised, by the Queensland government falls short of $100 million. I do not criticise the Queensland government and, up until yesterday when this banana thing cropped up, I had worked in total bipartisan harmony with the Queensland Premier, Mr Beattie. At no stage had either of the governments tried to make any political capital out of this. With every announcement I was about to make, I rang the Queensland Premier to talk about it. - He approached me; we agreed; we visited Innisfail together. I would not have offered a zephyr of criticism of the Queensland government, but we get the last week of an election campaign and he cannot help himself. - He grabs hold of this piece of absolute nonsense. He knows I have kept my promise, and he ought to be ashamed of himself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question and also for introducing me to families in his electorate of Bowman recently, who, through their sons, are making very practical and real contributions to the global war against terror. Across Iraq today there are 1,350 Australian Defence Force personnel who are working to secure freedom for Iraq, to see that Iraqis have the same rights and freedoms that we in Australia too often take for granted and which have been hard fought for by serving and previous generations of Australian Defence Force personnel.During my meeting with Prime Minister al-Maliki last week when I was in Iraq, he thanked Australia at some length for the contribution that it is making to see that Iraqis have these freedoms. For him, along with Zebari, the foreign minister, and also General Obeidi, with whom I also met, one of the constant themes was the role that is being played by al-Qaeda in Iraq to foment violence, and sectarian violence in particular, across the country. We should be under no illusions. For example, Osama bin Laden in December 2004 said, 'The third world war is raging in Iraq.' In his letter to Zarqawi dated 9 July 2005, al-Zawahari said of Iraq, 'It is the place for the greatest battle.' In his address to Congress in Washington on 27 July, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, said:Trust that Iraq will be the grave of terrorism and of terrorists for the good of all humanity.We have seen in the last couple of days the arrest of al-Saeedi. Iraq's National Security Adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said of this:Al-Saeedi carried out al-Qaeda's policies in Iraq, and the orders of the slain al-Zarqawi to incite sectarian violence in the country through attempting to start a civil war between Shiite and Sunnis.All of us would remember the horrendous bombing of the Askariya shrine in Samarra back in February, which triggered much of the sectarian violence we have since seen in Iraq.We need to understand, as Australians, that the struggle in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other places of the world is a struggle to which Australians are committed because we are standing against those who are completely committed to a new world order, which has hijacked the name of Islam to build a violent political utopia. Every Australian should be proud of what is being done by the Australian Defence Force in Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki said to me, 'You, Australia, were with us from the start.' I said, 'We will be there to see the job through and to see that Iraqis have the rights and freedoms that they deserve and that the world is free of terrorism.'</DOC>

 - Let me answer that question this way: what we said in the last election campaign was both believable and plausible. What we said was that interest rates under a coalition government would always be lower than under a Labor government. If you look at the record, you will see that they undoubtedly would be. In 13 years of Labor government - and I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question - housing interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent. In 10½ years of coalition government, they have averaged 7.25 per cent. They peaked at 17 per cent for housing under the former Labor government, they went to 21 per cent for small business and they went to 23 per cent for bill rates for farmers. It is plausible, credible and entirely accurate to say that interest rates under a coalition government will always be lower than under a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. I know that, as a former teacher, he would be interested in the Australian government's push to restore Australian history to its rightful place in our schools.I am pleased to report to the House that on 17 August a history summit was held here in Parliament House. Twenty-three leading historians, educators and commentators looked at issues such as what Australian history is being taught in Australian schools, how it is being taught, what could or should be taught and why. I am aware of Associate Professor Tony Taylor's critique, and a very fine summary of the Australian history summit it was. At the end of the day, we had a unanimous communique from the participants, who recommended to the Australian government that Australian history be a discrete, stand-alone subject, be compulsory for years 9 and 10 and be planned and taught sequentially through primary and secondary school. They also recommended that we work with state and territory governments to produce a model curriculum for Australian history. I have now established a working party to focus on the establishment of a model curriculum.I was asked about alternative views. Fortunately, because of the pressure of the overwhelming public support for the federal government's push to have Australian history restored to a discrete place in our school curriculum, a number of state governments have buckled and come on board and are now supporting the Australian government's push for Australian history to be a stand-alone subject. As for other views, I was rather surprised to read that the West Australian Labor education minister has decided that you do not need to learn history, that all you have to do is google it. The headline in the West Australian of 22 August read 'Don't learn it, just Google it: Ravlich'. The article said:Education Minister Ljiljanna Ravlich says it is not important for students to know key historical dates, saying they can find the information using the internet search engine Google._         _         _Questioned about a straw poll by The West Australian which revealed a lack of knowledge of key events in Australian history, she said: 'You can ask many students a range of questions about the internal workings of a computer and chances are they wouldn't know anything about that.'I have no idea what she was talking about, but it seems that the Leader of the Opposition did. The next day, the Leader of the Opposition supported this position. The headline in the West Australian read 'Google OK, says history fan Beazley'. The article reported:Kim Beazley has backed State Education Minister Ljiljanna Ravlich's claim that students do not need to learn significant historical dates because they can find them on the internet using Google, saying yesterday that 'she was on to something'.Mr Beazley said that he loved Ms Ravlich's 'Generation-X' comments, in which she also likened a lack of knowledge about Australian history to not knowing the internal workings of a computer. - I would caution the Leader of the Opposition about too heavy a reliance on Google. I looked up an Australian history time line on Google and it leaves out the arrival of the Duyfken to our northern shores, it leaves out the arrival of Captain Cook on our eastern shores, it leaves out the outbreak of the First World War and it leaves out the outbreak of the Second World War. It leaves out any mention of Curtin, it leaves out any mention of Menzies and there is no mention of 1975. I would caution the Leader of the Opposition -  - I do caution the Leader of the Opposition about relying on Google. This morning I looked up 'Kim Beazley' on Google. The first article was 'Kim Beazley - toothless in trouble' and the second was 'Kim Beazley completely loses the plot'. I would not have thought that this was the kind of history that the Leader of the Opposition would be promoting for our students. We would support learning, not googling. I know the Leader of the Opposition was committed to the 'noodle nation' education policy. Please spare us from a 'Google nation' education policy in the next election. No 'Google nation', please.</DOC>

 - Interest rates today are substantially lower than they were when the government was elected in 1996. Today the standard variable mortgage interest rate is 7.8 per cent but, as the Reserve Bank says, you can get rates lower than that. The standard variable mortgage interest rate when the government was elected was 10½ per cent. It was at 17 per cent.The Leader of the Opposition was going to draw the line under the Keating policy in a widely advertised speech in North Queensland leaked out to the newspapers. Here was going to be the final repudiation of the Keating high interest rate policy. One problem: when he got to actually read the speech, he could not pronounce the word 'Keating' and he left it out as a consequence. The Australian Labor Party is complicit in the economic failures of Paul Keating and the government in which he was Treasurer. The Australian Labor Party never had the wit to actually balance the budget. In 1998 we passed a very significant milestone. In 1998 we got the Australian budget back into balance, something that had evaded Keating, something that had evaded the then Minister for Finance, who has run up something like $60 billion of accumulated deficits. Where would Australia be today if this government had not decided to balance the budget and to repay Labor debt? Australia is much stronger as a consequence, and let it never be forgotten that the Labor Party fought and opposed us every step of the way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Of course, the member for Cowper, like many on this side, is concerned that everybody has the chance to get a job in these times. We have the lowest unemployment - on average a 30-year low right across the nation - but there are still some patches where unemployment is higher. So we as a government are determined to assist all Australians, especially people in areas of lower employment, to move across to parts where the economy is particularly booming, like over in the west and in northern Australia. We have therefore instigated a very special pilot that is going to assist people - in the first instance, from places like Coffs Harbour and Shoalhaven - to move across to areas like Broome, Kalgoorlie, Perth, Darwin and Karratha. Job Network members will be especially commissioned to do the actual supporting and recruitment, through videoconferencing and phone hook-up, so that people do not have to go a long way just on the chance that they might succeed with a job. They will also be supported with the upskilling that is necessary. Finally, there will be $4,000 to $5,000 in travel support which will cover not only the costs of the air or other fares but also the costs to help set up in the new location.Sadly, the opposition has little interest in the Aussie job seeker striving to become financially independent. The shadow spokesperson, Senator Wong, has said, yes, there might be a workforce participation policy coming along - but we have not seen one yet. There was a time when Labor did talk about mobility assistance. It was a policy many years ago. Let me quote to you exactly what it was about. In particular it said:... immediate minor assistance is a one-off payment available to unemployed job seekers who find a job but are unable to take it up because of the costs involved; for example, to buy special equipment or pay union fees.The good news is that in this country being able to afford to pay the unions is no longer a barrier to finding a job. This government is making sure that all job seekers are helped, even if they are now living in a place where there is some higher unemployment. We will support men and women to go to those places where the booming economy has work waiting, from the most skilled end through to a job where people can be trained when they get that job. This is a great initiative, and I strongly recommend that the opposition get behind this because it is about giving all Australians a fair go.</DOC>

 - That is a good question from the member for Hughes. Before question time, the member for Hughes let me know that the unemployment rate in her electorate has now dropped to 2.9 per cent - a 2.9 per cent unemployment rate in her electorate. There are a whole lot of factors that help to create low unemployment. The first factor is that we need to provide jobs and make sure the jobs are out there. The best way to get that is through a strong economy, and this government has helped to deliver a strong economy. Then we need to have workplace changes. Through Work Choices, which has now been in place for 162 days, we have more jobs and higher wages.We are doing our job in Human Services. Since Welfare to Work was introduced on 1 July this year, Centrelink has referred over 100,000 people to the Job Network. That also includes referral to the Disability Employment Network. In addition, over 25,000 Australians have had a job capacity assessment, where they have been evaluated for their capacity to work. In many of those cases they have been provided with rehabilitation services so that they can prepare for entry into work.That is just a reminder of how important Welfare to Work is. It is all about the fact that Australia is running out of workers. There is a pool of around 2.7 million Australians of working age who are on welfare payments and whom we need to access in order to address the labour shortage in Australia. I was very interested in an article I saw this morning in the Australian. -  - I am intrigued by the interjections by the Left here, because I am about to quote one of their fellows. In the Australian today, I read an article titled 'US moves from welfare to work'. It begins:In one of the greatest political and economic success stories of the past decade -  - You should listen to this - It goes on to say:It was 10 years ago last week that then president Bill Clinton passed into law a bill requiring people to find a job or lose their benefits after five years.That goes a lot further than what this government is doing. The article continues:Critics warned that the 1996 law would be catastrophic for single parents and their children.According to the article, one Democratic senator predicted that the US would leave children begging for money and begging for food. In fact, since those laws were introduced in the US 10 years ago, 1.6 million fewer children live in poverty in the United States as a result of welfare to work measures in the United States. As I say, our policies do not go as far as the policies in the US. But when you have a strong economy, when you have workplace change and when you are helping those most disadvantaged in the community to get into work, the recipe is success for Australia.</DOC>

 - My understanding is that, between the making of that statement and now, there has been a change in the law which says that you cannot give financial advice without having a licence. As somebody who regards himself as a supporter of the rule of law and a sworn officer of a very honourable court in this country - and also a member of this parliament - I respect that law. In those circumstances, I am not going to offer a view, but what I will say is that I have followed reaction to the announcement I made in Hobart last Friday week. I know those who sit opposite - I do not include the member for Adelaide in this, but I am thinking rather of the spokesman on these matters on the front bench of the Labor Party - were sort of hoping and praying that certain things would happen. They have not happened, and aren't they disappointed!On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - Obviously the Leader of the Opposition and I read the same news report this morning. My take is totally different. I thought that story was good news. I thought what it demonstrated was that the policy of the government is working. The Leader of the Opposition is a very interesting man. You bring in a subsidy that has a dramatic effect on the conversion rate to LPG, and the Leader of the Opposition says: 'This is terrible. We've got to do something about it.' Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition that the Australian LPG association estimates that it will take around six months for the industry's capacity to meet demand. As a result of the measures introduced by the government, there will be about 105,000 conversions - that is their estimate - over the 12-month period from the introduction of the measure. That is significantly higher than the current rate of about 32,000 a year. Let me quote from the words in a letter to my colleague from Tony Chapman, one of the LPG spokesmen quoted in the Australian article. He said this, inter alia:... my view is that this policy is a great initiative from the federal government to assist the consumer who are paying high petrol prices as well as benefiting Australian's environment and energy diversification.There has been a huge response to this initiative. Of course, when you provide a subsidy for something that previously has not been subsidised you are going to have a short-term excess of demand over supply, and no skills policy, no technical education policy, is ever going to provide for it in advance. If you provided in advance for every subsidy that might be introduced, you would have a lot of idle capacity. It shows just how little the Leader of the Opposition knows about the ordinary laws of supply and demand. -  - I will table this letter. It concludes with the words:I once again confirm my wholehearted support for this program.It starts with the statement:I was disappointed to read an article in today's Australian that stated that I had criticised the Government policy on providing a rebate for conversion to LPG for motorists.This could be no further from the truth, my view is that this policy is a great initiative from the federal government to assist the consumer who are paying high petrol prices ...I table with it with pleasure.</DOC>

As I think some members of the House would know and the honourable member knows, I was in Dili, in East Timor, yesterday and I had the opportunity of meeting with President Gusmao, Prime Minister Jose Ramos Horta and foreign affairs minister Guterres, as well as Brigadier Slater, the commander of the international forces there, and the commander of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Lancaster. I also participated in a trilateral meeting with the Indonesian foreign affairs minister, Hassan Wirajuda.I spent time with Brigadier Slater and Mr Lancaster discussing in particular the level of violence in and around Dili. The advice that I received was that, in an overall sense, the level of violence had reduced in recent times. It was now mainly gang related rather than politically driven violence. Having said that, I must say personally - and I think they would agree with me - that we are very concerned about the significant number of weapons which are at large and about the volatile political environment that still exists in East Timor. The break-out of 57 criminals from jail last Thursday was a matter of particular concern, not only because Major Reinado is amongst them but the other 56 are hardened criminals, and many of them are murderers.I made the point to the East Timorese that, for all the international community can do to help East Timor and for all that this country in particular has done to help East Timor since 1999, the East Timorese - and that is all of them - must understand that they are responsible for their own country. There is a real issue here of the East Timorese assuming that others will always sort out their problems for them. They need to understand that, first and foremost, they must sort out their own problems and that the rest of the international community, particularly Australia, can come and help from time to time. It is important to understand that, as a matter of policy, we constantly emphasise this point.With that in mind, we have welcomed Security Council resolution 1704, which we assisted in assembling. Assistance with elections, justice reform and reconciliation as well as a very substantial United Nations policing presence will, I think, be effective and will assist East Timor very substantially. I have made the point that the proposal for a blue-helmeted military component is inadequate and ill considered and that it needs to be thought through again. The Security Council obviously shares that view. The matter is now being reconsidered and will be before the Security Council again next month.It remains our view that it is best to have an Australian led green-helmeted military component there. After all, the force that we offer will for the foreseeable future be substantially larger than the force proposed by the United Nations, which is only 350. There is also the issue of tasking. The proposal put forward by the United Nations was that the blue-helmeted military component would only protect, in particular, the United Nations police and that it would not deal with broader breakdowns in law and order that could not be handled by the police. Those problems would need to be dealt with over and above providing protection for the United Nations.Let me say on these matters that we listen very much to the advice of the military, and of Brigadier Slater in particular. I want to take this opportunity - and I know that the Minister for Defence will appreciate this - to pay tribute to Brigadier Slater. I think he has done an exceptional job in very trying and difficult circumstances, and he deserves the support of the parliament and the Australian people for the simply outstanding job he has done.I can pass on to the House that President Xanana Gusmao and Prime Minister Horta expressed their deepest appreciation to me for Australia's assistance in East Timor. They know that, at the end of the day, the responsibility rests with them and their people to sort out their own problems and not just to look to the international community to solve all of their woes.</DOC>

 - First, I appreciate the honourable member's question and warmly thank him for the opportunity to deal with an issue that I notice he has raised in what I would have thought - if I may put forward the judgement - was an excessively partisan manner over recent times. If I may say so, it misjudges the Australian public. That is the mistake he makes: he misjudges the Australian public. I do stand by those statements that I made. We have of course reduced the number of military we have on the ground in East Timor quite substantially since that time. I think it would have been -  - certainly the advice we had from Brigadier Slater, who - if I may be so bold as to suggest - I think is an even better adviser than the member for Griffith on these matters. Perhaps that is excessively bold, but that is my view. We have substantially reduced the numbers, and we will continue to take the advice of Brigadier Slater and others. - I think the Australian people and the people of East Timor believe that this government has done an extraordinarily good job in assisting that country. As for the rhetorical and partisan flourish -  - at the end of the honourable member's question, I do not think almost anybody outside of the hard core of the ALP would remotely believe it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. As he knows, in this year's budget, the government handed down the most bold and visionary reform to superannuation that we have ever seen in Australia, to apply from 1 July 2007. We said we would consult in relation to transitional details, and we received 1,500 written submissions in August and 3,500 phone calls. Today I have announced the government's transitional details so that the plan can now be enacted with legislation to be introduced before the end of the year.Members will know that the simplicity of the plan is as follows: there will be no tax on benefits paid out of a taxed superannuation fund for people who are aged 60 years or over - no tax on lump sums, no tax on pensions. We will wipe away the complexity of the taxation arrangements on end benefits in superannuation, and we will make superannuation the preferred savings vehicle for all Australians. We will wipe away reasonable benefits limits. We will wipe away age based contributions. We will have simple rules whereby employer contributions of $50,000 per annum will be allowed - and $150,000 of undeducted contributions.In relation to the transitionals, we announced that, between now and 1 July 2007, people who were intending to make large contributions will be able, subject to any applicable work test, to put into superannuation $1 million of post-tax contributions. That will allow people who had put in place a retirement strategy to do so, unaffected by these changes, before 1 July 2007. We have also announced for small business people that they will be able, on the sale of their business or a business asset which they have held for 15 years, to put $1 million into superannuation. Of course, where couples are involved in business, that will apply to both the husband and the wife. We announced indexation of contribution taxes. We announced changes in relation to lump sum benefits from untaxed sources and new arrangements in relation to tax file numbers. The detail of these superannuation changes can be found on the Treasury website SimplerSuper.treasury.gov.au.The submissions that we got in relation to super were overwhelmingly positive. For example, we had Susan Ryan, the former Labor senator, saying:Maybe faced with the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but ... shabby super property, the Opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out, and the wherewithal to let voters know about it.Maybe Labor will; maybe it won't. Garry Weaven, the former ACTU officer, said: 'The government's recent budget initiatives have proved that the Liberal Party is now the official party for superannuation.' There you have endorsements from ACTU officials, from former Labor senators and from the industry. The only person we are yet to hear from in relation to the reaction to this superannuation plan - the only person who is yet to announce a position - is the Leader of the Opposition. He still cannot make up his mind. As I think the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, who worked on this, said, it is a bit like the three mines policy: yes, no, or maybe is the position that the Leader of the Opposition currently has in relation to superannuation. The Labor Party ought to come to a decision. It ought to try and get its mind around policy for once. When it does, it ought to support the government and this bold initiative: the biggest reform to superannuation in the history of superannuation.</DOC>

 - The truth of the matter is that Australians' asset growth has far outstripped their borrowings. As the Reserve Bank notes, we now have $6 of assets for every dollar of borrowing. As a consequence, for every dollar of debt, households have $2 in financial assets. The nominal wealth of households has increased by 11 per cent per annum, compared with a growth of six per cent per annum over the last seven years of the previous Labor government. What has in fact happened is that the Australian household sector has had the greatest accumulation of wealth that we have seen in generations. In relation to that, because interest rates are low, Australians have felt confident to borrow and, notwithstanding the fact that they have borrowed, their net asset position is still stronger. Let me come back to one thing that would really interrupt this accumulation of wealth by Australians. One thing that would really, really interrupt it would be an Australian Labor Party government. - Not only would they find that their assets would decline but in relation to their borrowings they would be at exposed levels as a consequence. - Everybody in Australia knows this. Labor cannot be trusted with money. Everybody in Australia knows that you cannot trust your money to the Labor Party. You could not do it when they were last in government and you will not be able to do it in the future either.

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As the member for Hinkler would be well aware, improving market access for Australia's agricultural exports is not just about removing tariff barriers but also about negotiating quarantine protocols to get fresh produce into those markets across the world. China is a classic and recent example with huge potential for the Australian citrus industry - for citrus growers in the member for Hinkler's electorate, in the member for Mallee's electorate, in the member for Riverina's electorate and probably in the member for Barker's electorate.During Premier Wen's visit here in April, we signed a quarantine protocol with the Chinese government to allow the export of all major varieties of Australian citrus into that rapidly growing market. The first consignment of Queensland mandarins from Mundubbera, in the member for Hinkler's electorate, has cleared Chinese customs and will be on sale in local markets in Beijing today - Australian mandarins are for sale in Beijing today!Australian Citrus Growers have said that this represents 'a real milestone, due to a strong export commitment in the industry and partnership with the Australian government'. The member for Hinkler would be pleased to know that a total of 48,600 kilos of mandarins were shipped from Mundubbera: 22,680 kilos have gone to Shanghai; 25,920 kilos have gone to Beijing. They expect an additional 300,000 kilos to go to China before October. Next year, the industry is hoping to further increase exports as oranges and other citrus fruits become more available to go into that market. This market could be worth in future over $50 million for Australia's citrus growers, and we know the difficult circumstances they have been through over the years.Now that we have established that protocol on citrus, our priorities will turn to getting table grapes, summer fruit and cherries into the Chinese market. This is an example of working closely with our counterparts in the Chinese government to establish these protocols.While we have been doing that and establishing a reform process in Australia - reforming the waterfront, for example, one of the key industrial relations reforms that have helped this industry export its product more efficiently and competitively - what have the Labor Party been doing? They have been opposing our reforms. They opposed us on the waterfront; they have opposed our taxation reforms; they have opposed our workplace relations reforms. Lately they have been raving on - there has actually been scaremongering - about the issue of bananas, trying to help out their mate in Queensland. And they have sacked the only member of the frontbench that knows anything about agriculture. That is all the Labor Party cares about our agricultural industries. Meanwhile our government is getting on and getting access for the citrus growers across Australia, particularly in the seat of Hinkler.</DOC>

 - Can I just say in relation to the question asked that I will check as to when any information was first received by the department of immigration in relation to ABC Tissue Products. I would note that there are two corporations involved in relation to the building of this factory - the company that is manufacturing on adjacent sites, ABC Tissue Products, and Hunan services, if that is the correct name, a company owned in China by the Chinese government. I think it is Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation.The advice I have is that on 28 July 2006 DIMA issued Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation with a notice of intention to sanction, on a number of grounds - including a failure to pay minimum salary levels, to comply with immigration laws, to comply with workplace relations laws, to ensure necessary licensing of workers and to notify Immigration of relevant changes of circumstances and deduction of tax instalments. A response was received on 4 September -  - A response was received on 4 September and the department is continuing to have discussions in relation to that matter in assessment of the claims that were given in response. Depending upon those findings, the department will decide whether or not sanctions might be applied. This could include barring Hunan from participation in the 457 program. The department will then contact visa holders to determine what their options might be.I am also advised that in relation to ABC Tissue Products, which was a separate matter, there were two visa holders who were found not to be carrying out duties in relation to a nominated position. A response was received which is being presently reviewed. Again, the situation is that, if there are matters that are not satisfactorily resolved, visas could be cancelled.In relation to the further question, there were, as I understand it, 21 visas granted on 22 and 23 May 2006, again following sponsorship by Hunan. The allegations were first raised by the AMWU in a letter to the minister on 23 May - that is, after the visa grants. No further visas or nominations have been approved for Hunan since that time.I would simply make the point that the Prime Minister made yesterday. If there are breaches of the law in relation to the way in which visas have been sought in these particular matters, they will be dealt with properly in accordance with the law, as you would expect.</DOC>

 - The APEC finance ministers will be meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday and Friday of this week. It is the 13th such annual meeting. Vietnam being a developing economy, the principal focus of the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting will be on how to promote capital flows in the region, particularly investment in developing countries.After the APEC meeting, at which I will be representing Australia, I will be going to South Africa to confer with finance minister Trevor Manuel, who will become the chairman of the Group of Twenty after Australia's host year concludes at the end of this year. The Group of Twenty brings together the developed and the developing worlds to discuss matters of global international financial architecture. It will be meeting in November in Melbourne, because Australia is the chair.The issues that we have placed on the agenda for that meeting include energy security. We will be bringing together energy producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia and large global energy users such as China and the United States. We will also be engaging in discussion on demographic change and the effect on financial flows and trade.The G20 has also developed into an important forum for reform of the international financial institutions of the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF and World Bank meetings will be held in Singapore on 19 and 20 September and prospects are good for a proposal which has been put forward by the G20, but in particular by Australia, to be adopted at that meeting in Singapore. It is a proposal to increase voting shares of the most clearly underrepresented members of the IMF - China, Korea, Mexico and Turkey - with a second stage of additional reform to align shares with relative positions in the world economy. This will be an extremely significant reform of the International Monetary Fund in accordance with the development of the global economy. Australia has been at the forefront of efforts to see this adopted, particularly through our influence in the G20 - probably the premier meeting of central bank governors and finance ministers in the world, which will be held in Australia in November of this year.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the allegations that have been made and, as I indicated yesterday, proceedings have been taken. If there are breaches of the law, they will be dealt with in accordance with the law. But - while I am on my feet - given that this question and a number of questions are about 457 visas, I caused a little bit of research to be done on the subject of 457 visas. As I indicated yesterday, as of January this year the largest single user of 457 visas was the New South Wales Department of Health. Recently the New South Wales health minister issued a statement proudly declaring that almost three-quarters of the 1,000 nurses to join the New South Wales health system as a result of a 2005 overseas recruitment drive would be on 457 visas. The truth is that the eight state and territory Labor governments have facilitated this; they have been up to their armpits in these visas. Since 2002, South Australia has more than quadrupled its state sponsored skilled migration intake, Queensland has more than tripled it, Western Australia has nearly tripled it, and New South Wales and Victoria have almost doubled it. The ACT, Tasmania -  - and the Northern Territory have increased their skilled migrant intake by 70 per cent, 50 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. What these figures demonstrate is the truth of the statement often made by my colleague the Treasurer: hypocrisy. Labor, thy name is hypocrisy. They have been up to their armpits, bringing people in under these 457 visas, but all the while at a state and provincial level, as if they were some other organisation, Labor governments have been busily taking advantage. That is fundamentally a common-sense proposition. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition of something he said when he was addressing -  - He was addressing the ethnic communities breakfast. At least they let him speak, which was more than the Queensland Labor Party did at the Labor Party's launch. This is what he had to say. He was talking about skilled migrants creating job opportunities for other Australians. This is what he said:Far from -  - This is what he had to say when he addressed the ethnic communities breakfast on 24 July 1998. He said:I would say the Leader of the Opposition then was speaking the truth. The great problem that the Leader of the Opposition really has is that we have the lowest unemployment rate in this country for 30 years and he cannot come to terms with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I certainly acknowledge his vigorous lobbying on behalf of people with cancer in his electorate. I can tell the House that, thanks to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Australians have affordable access to life-saving and life-enhancing drugs. We all know that PBS spending had been growing at an average rate of about 10 per cent a year since 1996. But, thanks to cost control measures put in place by this government, particularly the 12½ per cent mandatory price cut for the new generics measure, that growth slowed to under three per cent last year. This has meant that there has been some headroom to allow new drugs into the system - in particular, to allow three expensive new listings from 1 October.The first listing is of the drug Herceptin, which will be available to about 2,000 women with breast cancer at a cost of well over $100 million a year. The second listing is of two drugs, Lantus and Levemir, which will be available to over 100,000 people with diabetes at a cost of up to $40 million a year. The third listing is of cholesterol-reducing drugs known as statins, which will be available to an additional 250,000 people at risk of heart disease at a cost of up to $40 million a year.These new listings will add 0.8 per cent to estimated PBS growth rates over the forward estimates period, but the government is confident that this additional spending is more than justified because of the health outcomes that it will secure. This is just more evidence that you can trust the Howard government with your health care and that the Howard government is more assuredly than ever the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - I am quite sure that I would have said something like that on 22 June 2006 - and, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I would have consistently said it on 22 June in the nine previous years, because I have always had the view that you only bring people into these situations where there is clearly a shortage of Australian workers. What I find strange is that, every second time somebody from the Labor Party gets up, they start talking about the skills shortage but, when you bring people in to fix it, they say, 'Oh, that's bad.'If there has been any breach by this company, then this company deserves to be punished. But that in no way alters the general proposition that I have maintained. That general proposition is that, where there is a demonstrated shortage of Australian workers, we do need to bring in overseas workers. As I pointed out in my previous answer, that is uniformly the attitude of every state and territory Labor government in this country. It is complete hypocrisy for the Labor Party, on the one hand, at a state level, to bring in foreign workers to fill the gaps and yet, on the other hand, at a federal level, to try to run some kind of scare campaign in relation to the bringing in of foreign workers. If the ABC company has broken the law, it ought to have the book thrown at it. But that does not alter the validity of the current situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question. I can report to him and to the House that the government has made significant progress in bringing about much reform in Australia's $50 billion building and construction industry. Indeed, in the March 2006 quarter, there was a record low rate of disputation recorded in the commercial construction industry.Regrettably, this progress has not stopped the pattern of thuggery and intimidation by the CFMEU. Last week CFMEU members made threatening and profane comments to legal counsel in court in Perth. Worse than that, in the same week, CFMEU members made quite distasteful and inappropriate comments to a female journalist covering a rally in Perth. So here we have two more instances of the pattern of behaviour of these thugs in the CFMEU seeking, in one instance, to intimidate the courts in Western Australia and, in the other instance, seeking to intimidate a female journalist from the media within Perth. All of this was condoned by the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, who both was in the court at the time the comments were made and also addressed the rally where these quite inappropriate comments were made to a female journalist.On top of that, we hear absolutely nothing from the Leader of the Opposition, who has not said one word to condemn this intimidation. This is a pattern of behaviour by the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, he will not support the reforms to clean up the thuggery and the intimidation in the building and construction industry in Australia and then he will not condemn this intimidation which was going on as recently as last week - and why? Because the CFMEU has paid some $5 million to the Australian Labor Party over the last 10 years. This is unacceptable behaviour. We had the Leader of the Opposition in August speak in support of unionists who took unlawful industrial action on a Perth construction site in defiance of an Australian Industrial Relations Commission order that they return to work. During this rally the Leader of the Opposition made a quite extraordinary claim when he said that this was 'an authorised piece of industrial action going on'. - This is despite the fact that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission clearly ruled that the industrial action was unlawful and unauthorised and that it should cease in that circumstance. In one statement the Leader of the Opposition has shown, firstly, that he is not across the facts when it comes to these issues and, secondly, that he is prepared to undermine the authority and the reputation of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Building Construction Commission - two independent bodies. He has shown that he supports unionists taking damaging economic action, as they have done with irresponsible, unlawful industrial action. He has shown that he would rather do the bidding of the union bosses for their $5 million than stand up for the $50 billion Australian building and construction industry.He suggested that people should only obey the law if they respect that law. That is what the Leader of the Opposition suggested last week. It is quite shameful. It shows once again that he is weakly prepared to put vested interests ahead of the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and for his long pre-parliamentary career in service to the Australian Army. The future of defence and security for our country is going to be most influenced not by what we know today but by what we do not. Based on a broad strategic assessment of the outline for the future in defence, the political will of the government to continually invest in Australia's Defence Force and also a strong economy, the government has decided to increase the size of the Australian Army by two battalions, or 2,600 more soldiers, over the next 10 years. At a cost of some $10 billion, this means the Australian Defence Force will be, by the end of this further growth from six to eight battalions, the largest that it will have been for almost 30 years.The 5/7 battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment in Darwin will be split into two battalions, and the 7th will go to Adelaide where it will be based in the electorate of Wakefield. Both battalions will be equipped with armoured personnel carriers. The 3rd Battalion RAR will move from Sydney to Townsville, which means there will be another battalion in Townsville. The 8/9 battalion will be reraised in south-east Queensland, at either Enoggera or Amberley.It is extremely important Australians appreciate that we must not look only at our borders and the defence and security of Australia's people, our interest and values. If you look through the south-west Pacific from East Timor through to the Pacific island state nations, it is clear that for the foreseeable future the Australian Defence Force is likely to be called upon not only to provide security, stabilisation and border protection and to assist in humanitarian disasters but also to support counterterrorism across our region. It is also very clear, from the point of view of the Australian government, that security and defence of this country will rely for the foreseeable future also on us appreciating the need to support actions in other parts of the world. What happens in Afghanistan and Iraq and the Middle East has everything to do with a secure Australia.It should also be remembered that when it was in government, the Australian Labor Party, for seven years from 1989, stripped 6½ thousand soldiers from the Australian Army. This government is about replacing them and strengthening the Australian Army. This decision and this investment in Australia's future and security is not about this year and it is not about next year; it is about the kind of Australia we want a decade from now, and the kind of security we want for our country and its place in the world. This is an important investment in people and equipment and the long-term security of our country.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Herbert will remember that last year he and I announced that the Australian government would be locating an emergency towage vessel permanently in North Queensland. That is an important announcement and an important step forward, because these are increasingly busy waters to our north and, of course, it is a very fragile and important environmental area for Australia. So last week it was a particular pleasure for my wife and me to be in Cairns to commission the ETV, Pacific Responder. This vessel will provide an emergency towage capability in our northern waters for the first time. Whilst there are important shipping lanes in that region, there are actually no tugs in that area capable of undertaking emergency towage work and when there have been incidents in the past - fortunately, not too often - it has been necessary to bring in a vessel from southern Queensland or the southern states or even Singapore.But now there will be a vessel permanently located in the region - and what a fine vessel it is. It will be the biggest tug in Australia, so it has enormous capacity to help, to respond promptly in the event of there ever being an incident in North Queensland. Obviously, it will be called out only occasionally, and in the interim it will do work tending the various navigational aids and other vital facilities in northern waters. It will spend considerable time cruising in that area to make sure that all of the important navigational aids and other maritime facilities are effectively maintained and cared for. So the presence of this vessel adds a new mantle of safety to that region. For the first time we will have emergency towage capabilities in our northern waters, and it will add to a network of vessels all the way around the coast which will be on a first-call basis in the event of there being an emergency maritime incident anywhere around Australia. This important gap is being filled. Our pristine environmental areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef, are much safer as a result of this initiative, and it adds a new dimension to Australia's capacity to respond to maritime incidents in our environment.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for his question. I can inform the House that over the life of the current healthcare agreements the Commonwealth will give Queensland more than $8 billion towards the running of public hospitals in that state. In addition, Queensland will receive more than $8 billion in GST revenue this year, including a $700 million windfall that was not anticipated when the GST agreement was made. Despite these rivers of gold, the Beattie government is spending 25 per cent less per head on public hospitals than the other states. We are all aware of the problem of inadequately trained overseas doctors in Queensland, including one whose treatment caused the death of a woman in the area of the member for Blair. We are all aware of inadequate bed numbers in Queensland, including the secret shutdown last week of mental health beds at Ipswich hospital.But there is more evidence today of the continuing crisis in Queensland public hospitals. Figures just out show that in the last 12 months the number of people waiting longer than the medically recommended time for treatment in Queensland public hospitals has increased to almost 10,000. At Royal Brisbane Hospital there are now 3,700 people waiting to see an ear, nose or throat specialist, there are 2,000 people waiting to see eye specialists and, according to Queensland health insiders, these people can wait up to four years to see a doctor. At Townsville hospital and Princess Alexandra Hospital patients with aggressive cancers are waiting double and triple the recommended times for treatment.The Queensland election should be a referendum on the state of Queensland's public hospitals. Whatever Premier Beattie says, Labor now officially believes that there is no such thing as answers to the problems of Australia's public hospitals. I came across a speech by the member for Lalor just the other day. Listen to what the member for Lalor thinks. She says:The one thing you can be sure of is that anyone who has already made up their mind about exactly what Governments should do in this area just hasn't thought through all the difficult issues.So, if you know what you are doing, by definition you are wrong! That is what the member for Lalor says; that is what she thinks. Is it any wonder that Labor is now officially a policy-free zone in health?</DOC>

 - I got my hopes up when the honourable member rose to his feet; I thought I might have got a banana question, and at long last I could tap all the great Labor lies, which are continuing even to this day and which are being broadcast throughout Queensland by Premier Beattie, once and for all. - The honourable member even speaks about the latest import going into restaurants, which is another of Labor's great lies. - This matter, as I say, is under continuing deliberation within the cabinet and within the government; I have nothing further to add to my previous answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. It is worth reminding the House that state governments are in fact primarily responsible for funding state government schools. They own and operate schools and ought to be primarily responsible for funding state government schools. But increasingly the Australian government has been called upon to fund state government schools where there are failures on the part of state governments. In every budget since 1996 the Australian government has increased the funding for state government schools, even though over that period the enrolments have remained static and are in fact predicted to decline. In the period 1996 to the current date the Australian government has increased funding to Queensland state government schools by some 137 per cent, so there has been a massive increase by the Australian government. But, if we take this year as an example, we see that this year the Australian government's increase in funding for Queensland government schools is 11 per cent. If the Queensland government had matched the Australian government's percentage increase, that would have meant an extra $218 million from the Queensland government for Queensland school students in Queensland government schools.What we are seeing here is a failure on the part of the Queensland government to match the Australian government percentage increases. They are already failing Queensland school students, because if they had matched our funding it would be an extra $218 million. Now the spend per student in a Queensland government school is some $280 less than the average of all other states. In addition, under the Australian government's $1 billion Investing in Our Schools program, we have now invested a further $57 million in Queensland state government schools. In rounds 1 and 2 of the Investing in Our Schools program we have awarded over 1,000 applications for schools requiring such basic infrastructure items as support for their ovals, libraries, computers and carpets. In round 3, which has just closed, there are over 2,000 applications from Queensland state government schools. There are only 1,280 Queensland state government schools, so essentially every government school in Queensland is turning to the Australian government for help. So I call upon the Queensland education minister to use some of the $8 billion that Queensland gets under the GST and invest in Queensland government schools, match the percentage increase that the Australian government provides for Queensland state government schools and support Queensland schoolchildren.</DOC>

 - There is no plan to drive down Australian wages. It is very interesting that I am asked this question today, when the national accounts for the June quarter show that wages under this government, since March of 1996, have risen by 16.4 per cent in real terms. The only time in recent recorded history that wages have been driven down was the period between March 1983 and March 1996, when the Statistician records that real wages actually fell by 0.2 per cent.As to the particulars of that individual case, I am not personally aware of it. I do not know who that man's employer was; it may even have been a state government agency. - I will get some information and, if there is anything I can inform the House of, I will be happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. The national account figures today show that, largely due to a change in inventories, there was some moderation of growth in the Australian economy during the June quarter. GDP grew by 2.7 per cent in the financial year, which is slightly higher than the forecast of 2.5 per cent in the recent budget, but through the year growth was 1.9 per cent. National income growth continues to be very strong, with real gross domestic income rising by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter, to be 3.3 per cent higher than a year ago.Compensation of employees - in plain language, wages - grew by two per cent in the June quarter. Very interestingly, this is the first quarter under Work Choices, and wages have risen by two per cent. In the previous March quarter, they rose by 1.2 per cent and in the December quarter they rose by 1.8 per cent. I do not notice any evidence yet of those wages having been driven down as a result of Work Choices.New business investment grew by 2.6 per cent in the June quarter, to be 11.8 per cent higher than a year ago. Growth has been particularly strong in engineering construction, which grew by 4.8 per cent in the June quarter, to be 21.6 per cent higher than a year ago. Dwelling investment rose by 3.7 per cent but remains four per cent lower than a year ago.As I indicated, falls in inventories subtracted 0.8 of a percentage point from growth in the June quarter, and that run-down was very broadly based. Given the fall in the June quarter, it is fair to say that inventories are likely to add to growth in the next quarter.We still have a very strong economy. The benefits of it are spreading all around the country - and nowhere more so than in electorates like Stirling. Unemployment is at a 30-year low. Wages remain strong. Job opportunities are there in abundance in many parts of Australia. I know the opposition will be disappointed, but more Australians have job opportunities now than in the lifetime of just about anybody in this House.</DOC>

 - I am happy to provide members who are interested in the matter with a substantive answer. I am told Mr Zhang first approached the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 22 August this year. Mr Zhang was interviewed on the same day and the Office of Workplace Services was contacted on 23 August. The department interviewed Mr Zhang again on 28 August with the Office of Workplace Services in attendance. The Office of Workplace Services conducted a site visit this morning. The department also attempted to visit A-Print this morning to confirm the allegations. These site visits may provide a basis for imposing sanctions.Many of the issues raised in the allegations are not permissible under 457 visa regulations and other Australian laws and, if proven, may have serious consequences for the employer. But, at least until the allegations are resolved, A-Print will not be permitted to sponsor any further workers. Another worker at A-Print had been sponsored. That person is overseas and the visa has been cancelled.Mr Zhang will be given a reasonable opportunity to find another sponsor and, if he is unable to find another sponsor, his costs of return would be met by A-Print. Under the sponsorship undertakings, A-Print is responsible for minimum salary levels being met 28 days after notifying the department of cessation of employment. If there has been any underpayment, A-Print will need to make good those wages. A-Print remains responsible for a range of his further costs. The department has referred the allegations relating to rental arrangements to the Victorian office of fair trading.</DOC>

 - I first thank the honourable member for her question and for her interest. I think the House would be aware that there were some reports in newspapers this morning which, I must admit, very much surprised me that the Indonesian Supreme Court had increased the sentences of four of the Australians who were amongst the nine. Those sentences have been increased to the death penalty. The reports relate to Scott Rush, who was sentenced to life - he had been appealing for a reduction in that sentence; to Si Yi Chen; to Tan Duc Nguyen; and to Matthew Norman. They were all first sentenced to life by the Denpasar District Court. On appeal to the Bali High Court, they had their sentences reduced to 20 years. The prosecution had then appealed to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the original sentence reinstated.I understand that in none of these four cases had the prosecution at any of these stages asked for the death penalty. Having said that, the House would be aware that the death penalty had been applied in two cases. The reports suggest that those two death penalties have been upheld as well.Since we heard of these reports, the embassy in Jakarta has been doing everything it can to try to establish whether these reports are correct or not. Let me tell the House I do not know, even at this time, whether these reports are correct or whether they are not correct. The embassy has spoken to the Minister for Law and Justice, they have spoken to the Attorney-General, they have spoken to their departments, and they have spoken to people in the Indonesian Supreme Court - all of these - in the course of this morning, and still they have been unable to establish whether these reports are correct or not.I am not suggesting that these reports are wrong; I am not suggesting they are right. At this time we simply do not know. When we get confirmation one way or another, the government will approach the families involved first, and subsequently we will make some public comments about it. It is important to remember - as I know all members of the House will remember and do remember - the sensitivities of the families and obviously those directly affected. I know all members of parliament respect that.In conclusion, let me make the point that, in the event of Australians being sentenced to death, it is the policy of the Australian government and has been for many years to appeal for clemency. If these reports are correct, we will appeal to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono at the appropriate time for clemency for these Australians who may be sentenced to death. But let me say, finally, that Australians should never forget that drug trafficking - particularly trafficking in heroin - in Asian countries, with very few exceptions, brings with it the death penalty. While we do not have the death penalty in this country, many countries in the region do. Although we do not approve of the death penalty, we certainly take the view that countries that take strong action against drug trafficking, above all into our own country, are countries that are doing the right thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. Japan is Australia's best customer as well as the largest economy in East Asia, and therefore incredibly valuable to Australia's export industries. Many of those emanate from the member's electorate. Next year, 2007, will be the 50th anniversary of the signing of the commerce treaty between Australia and Japan. Since that treaty was signed the economic relationship between our two countries has grown dramatically, and that has helped underpin a lot of the jobs growth in Australia. It is a well-known fact that one in five jobs across the economy relies on an export industry for its creation and existence. Just out of interest, in the 2005-06 year merchandise exports to Japan rose by 24 per cent to $30.98 billion, underpinning many Australian export industries and jobs in the Australian economy. For example, Japan is our largest market for coal and aluminium, our largest market for beef, our largest market for dairy products, our second largest market for horticulture, our second largest market for seafood and our third largest market for manufactured goods and tourism. As you can see, over the 50 years of that relationship the Japanese market has continued to grow and provide many jobs in our economy.Inbound Japanese investment in Australia is also quite significant. It directly provides employment for about 50,000 Australians and indirectly provides employment for about 200,000 Australians. Members may be aware that the government has been in consultation and has been engaged in a feasibility study with the Japanese government into the prospects of launching a negotiation on a free trade agreement between our two countries. We have agreed to move this process forward a little bit faster so it can be concluded by the end of this year, at which time both governments can make a decision whether to move ahead with the FTA negotiation. It is not just about improving and providing new market access into an incredibly valuable market for Australian exporters but it is also about consolidating our position in that market.Members may like to know that for the last year or so Australia has exported about 91 per cent of all Japanese beef imports. We have dominated that part of the Japanese market for a range of reasons, but underpinning all that have been a lot of the reforms that we as a government have introduced, whether they have been waterfront reforms, taxation reform, removing $3 billion worth of taxes off the back of our export products or reforms in the workplace that have made us more competitive and more efficient in the international marketplace and have helped maintain our presence in that market. The government will continue to pursue every opportunity we can to expand our economic relationship with Japan so that it delivers as it has done over the last 50 years.</DOC>

However, it is desirable that as much English and other instruction relating to the Australian lifestyle as possible is provided to refugees chosen for resettlement in our country before they arrive here.

 - First of all I thank the member for Ryan for his question, and for asking not just for the interest of the House but on behalf of the constituents of Ryan. - I am sure they do. The government is seriously concerned that Iran has chosen to defy the clearly expressed views of the international community - through the United Nations Security Council - that it should suspend its uranium enrichment related activities by a deadline which was the end of last month. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Director-General's report at the end of last month confirmed that Iran had not taken any steps to adhere to the Security Council resolution's demands and that it has also continued to defy the International Atomic Energy Agency by denying it full access and the transparency required to verify its previous nuclear declarations. The report also uncovered a further, as yet unexplained, incident of highly enriched uranium contamination. Australia shares the disappointment of the P5 - the five permanent members of the Security Council - and Germany, who have worked so hard to try to persuade Iran to accept an incentives package and to understand the possible consequences of not adhering to the demands of the international community.In conclusion, we hope that over the next few weeks it will be possible for the international community to persuade Iran to adhere to the demands of the international community, but if Iran refuses to do so there is no doubt that some kinds of sanctions will be introduced by the international community in one form or another. I do not want to speculate at this stage on what those sanctions may be, but it is a matter of grave concern to us that Iran is not listening to the IAEA or to the United Nations Security Council, and it is a matter of grave concern that a country which has been supporting Hezbollah and Hamas with weapons and money, and which has a president who says that Israel should be wiped off the face of the earth, could have plans to develop a nuclear weapons capability. That is deeply destabilising, and Iran should fulfil its obligations of responsible behaviour to the international community.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no. The longer answer, because I have considerable regard and affection for the member for Banks -  -  - I do; the member for Banks has many qualities, and I treat any question he asks very seriously, as I do questions asked by the gentleman who sits immediately in front of him on the other side. - Immediately in front of him, I say to the member for Blaxland - don't get excited. I am quite interested in Sydney house prices, as I know the member for Banks is, and I have done a little research. - No; I am enjoying it. I have done a little bit of research -  - and do you know what that research tells me? The research tells me that in real dollars in Sydney between 1973 and 2003 - and, I say to the member for Banks, both of us remember 1973; it was not a very good year for the Australian economy. Gough Whitlam was seeing to that. - Between 1973 and 2003 housing affordability declined because over that period of time the cost of land rose by 700 per cent. The member for Banks has asked a question about a very important issue, and that is housing affordability for young Australians. I am glad he asked it because the reason, more than anything else, why it is hard for young people to buy their first home is that the price of land in outer metropolitan areas of Australia has gone up. In Sydney it has gone up by 700 per cent. -  - Fifteen years ago interest rates in this country were double what they are now, yet housing was more affordable. That, as a matter of logic, must mean that there are reasons other than interest rates why housing is now not affordable for young Australians. The reason is that the cost of land has gone up astronomically because state governments will not release enough land for young homebuyers. That is the reason. - The other reason is that state governments around Australia have used the development process -  - The reason why housing is now so hard for young people to get into is that the cost of buying a house has gone up dramatically due to the cost of land having gone up - in the case of Sydney, by 700 per cent - and also due to the fact that state governments are using a development process as a money-making exercise. - It is not due to interest rates. It is overwhelmingly due to the factors I have mentioned, and it is about time that the inner-urban elites that dominate the urban consolidation policies of state Labor governments were put aside in the interests -  - of young homebuyers who want to have a home of their own on the outer periphery of our great cities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question. It is true that there are misleading and deceptive claims that are being made, in particular by the union movement and by the Leader of the Opposition.To give you another example of this misleading and deceptive campaign, in January this year the Leader of the Opposition established a task force to seek out the so-called adverse impact of the Work Choices legislation, even before it came into operation on 27 March. That task force reported back to the Leader of the Opposition in June of this year and so-called evidence from this report was then used to ask a question of the Prime Minister in this place in June by the member for Gorton. The basis of the question put to the Prime Minister was that this was evidence from an ordinary Australian worker. In the list of witnesses in the report this so-called ordinary Australian worker is listed as a local sporting coach, and elsewhere in the report it is said that he is an electrical worker.With some investigation, it turns out that the facts are somewhat different to what the member for Gorton put to the Prime Minister on that day. In fact, this so-called ordinary Australian worker turns out to be an official of the Electrical Trades Union. If you go to the website of the Electrical Trades Union, not only is this official listed but there is a colour photograph of him. But this of course, according to the member for Gorton and the task force, is an ordinary Australian worker. I table that website from the Electrical Trades Union. This is just one of a series of similar descriptions that are made in this bogus report from the Labor Party's task force, where they have union officials -  - and Labor Party members posing as ordinary Australian workers. It is a bogus report.The member for Gorton then left the chamber. - What we have here is a campaign orchestrated by the Leader of the Opposition to mislead and deceive the Australian public and indeed to attempt to mislead this House in the process. That is an indictment upon the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition; it is a deliberate campaign. What we see through this incident, and other incidents in this place -  - is a pathology of behaviour that makes the Leader of the Opposition unfit for high office in this country. That is what it does. Let us not forget that the Leader of the Opposition has never condemned the campaign of Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, who said, 'We want the family of a dead or injured worker to help our campaign.' That has never been condemned by the Leader of the Opposition. He can carry on with this silly laughter here, but if he had any fair dinkumness about him he would come out and condemn Sharan Burrow for this distasteful, in fact disgusting, comment that she made. -  - He has never condemned the ACTU for their false and misleading campaign. Indeed, when the independent Office of Workplace Services comes out and shows how false and misleading this campaign was, all we get from the Leader of the Opposition is a comment about snivelling little liars. That is how he describes public servants in Australia who are doing their jobs. This is an indictment once again on the Leader of the Opposition. It shows once again that he is totally unfit for high office in Australia.</DOC>

 - Over a period of time, it is a matter of logic that the greater the supply the more the demand is met. Over a period of time, it would become more affordable. - Of course it would. This is very interesting, because the logic of what the member for Lilley is saying is: 'You don't have any new land releases and you drive the price of housing up even more.' That is what the member for Lilley is saying. While I am on my feet, I have come across something that is very interesting -  - It is very related to the question. I really should have remembered this when I answered the question from the member for Banks. He once had a job on the opposition frontbench, and I thought it was a pity that the current opposition leader did not keep him on the frontbench. - When addressing in his then shadow capacity a national summit on housing affordability, this is what the then opposition spokesman had to say:We need to increase the availability of affordable land for the construction of new housing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know how concerned he has been about ineptitude by doctors registered by the Queensland Medical Registration Board. In July, at the Council of Australian Governments meeting, the Prime Minister and the premiers agreed to establish a single national body to register health professionals for practice here in Australia. The precise model for this national health registration board will be finalised by July next year and the new national health registration scheme will be operational by July 2008.A national health registration scheme is necessary to allow competent doctors to practise anywhere in Australia, and it is also necessary to ensure that the doctors practising anywhere in Australia are in fact competent. In Queensland in particular, as the member for Hinkler knows only too well, the state Medical Registration Board has sometimes failed to check doctors' credentials, with disastrous results for patients, such as occurred in Bundaberg, where some 13 deaths have been attributed to botched operations performed by an incompetent doctor. In the notorious Dr Death case, the Queensland board did not check for outstanding negligence claims and did not ensure that Dr Patel was working under supervision, as he was supposed to be working.I am confident that the national health registration board will not repeat these mistakes. But no registration system is proof against an institutional culture of coercion and intimidation, such as has existed in Queensland Health. When Dr Patel was first exposed in parliament, the Bundaberg Health Service appointed by the Queensland government not only wrote a letter of support to Dr Patel but began a witch-hunt against whistleblowers. The person who seconded the motion to gag whistleblowers and to try to prevent further revelations in parliament is now the Labor Party's candidate for Bundaberg in the state election. If Premier Beattie were serious about fixing problems in Queensland Health, he would disendorse this candidate, who is part of the Dr Death cover-up scandal. Mr Speaker, I table documents relevant to the case.</DOC>

 - The privatisation of Medibank Private is no more likely to lead to higher insurance premiums than the privatisation of Qantas led to higher airfares and the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank led to higher interest rates. The best guarantee of low premiums is competition, not government ownership. That is the best guarantee of low premiums. Let me quote someone who knows something about health insurance:The pressure on premiums will be reduced if Medibank goes private. We expect much more aggressive competition from a privately owned Medibank.That person, who does know something about private health insurance, is the chief executive of NIB. He should be respected by members opposite because the member for Hunter is his brother, and I prefer on this subject the view of the chief executive of NIB to that of any newspaper commentator, however distinguished.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and recognise her keen advocacy for upgrading the road infrastructure in her fast-growing part of Queensland. Indeed, the Australian government has allocated over $3 billion to Queensland for road construction projects and other infrastructure in the AusLink program. It is a very substantial investment and includes over $1 billion worth of road construction projects in south-east Queensland alone. We have a real commitment to building some of the vital infrastructure that is necessary in Queensland. Indeed, our funding to Queensland under AusLink represents a 119 per cent increase over the previous five years. So that is a very substantial investment.The honourable member asked what other road projects are under consideration in south-east Queensland. At this time, when political parties are putting their manifests to the Queensland people as to what they are going to spend on roads, I thought I would turn to the Labor Party's policy statement in relation to roads for Queensland. In it, the Queensland Labor Party boast that they have had a capital works increase of a massive 58 per cent. Well, if 58 per cent is massive, what is our 119 per cent? I do not think they could find words to describe that. If you took our 119 per cent increase out of the amounts that Labor are claiming credit for in Queensland, there would be very little left indeed. Labor have never had any commitment to roads in Queensland and over the years they have allowed the infrastructure to fall away.They have listed four projects that are currently underway in Queensland. The biggest of these is the $1.6 billion Gateway duplication. Actually, I do not think it has started yet but they have put this on their list of projects that are underway. They did not bother to mention, of course, that it is going to be fully funded by tolls. In fact, the Queensland government will actually make a profit out of this $1.6 billion worth of expenditure. But this is how they manage to boost their road expenditure to get a massive 58 per cent figure.They also frequently refer in their policy document to the Tugun Bypass - a project that I know the honourable member for McPherson is keenly interested in - never again mentioning the fact that $120 million of the cost of that project is actually being provided by the Australian government. Even though it is a Queensland government road, we are contributing $120 million, but in the Labor Party policy document there is no acknowledgement whatever of the contribution of the federal government towards that project.Of course, that is fairly typical. In fact, I am a little surprised that the Labor Party would even want to mention the Tugan Bypass in the context of an election, because at the last election we all remember when Premier Beattie went down on the eve of the election breathless and announced a new route for the Tugun Bypass which was going to clean up a score of houses along the edge of the airport. The people of Currumbin remember the Beattie drive-pass. It was bye-bye to the infamous Merri Rose and welcome to Jann Stuckey as a result of that commitment to the Tugun Bypass. The reality is that here we have a Labor government that has failed Queensland on road infrastructure and has nothing to offer for new road infrastructure when they go to the people on Saturday. All it does is seek to take credit for the roads that the Commonwealth is funding and providing as a part of our AusLink network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for that question. I have got very involved in this largely as a result of representations made to me by the member for Gwydir, the former Deputy Prime Minister. I did meet a delegation from the National Farmers Federation and from some of the irrigators. The problem here is the way in which the payments are currently structured by the New South Wales government. I understand that. I understand the point that the member for New England is making in relation to timber. The New South Wales government thus far have represented to us that they want the payment treated as income because, apparently, they are fearful of a precedent being established whereby such payments are seen as truly they are, and that is as compensation for the withdrawal of a previously conferred water right. It is my view that these payments are in the nature of compensation for the withdrawal of the previously conferred water right.I myself do not believe that you can regard these payments as being in the character of income. I do not believe that. So, in that sense, the law is not wrong. What the law says at the present moment is that if you get a payment which is in the nature of income then it is assessable but that if you get a payment which is in the nature of compensation for a capital loss then it is treated under the capital gains tax provisions of the law.I have discussed this matter with the member for Gwydir and with the irrigators. I have asked my parliamentary secretary, the member for Wentworth, to discuss the matter with the New South Wales government. I take the opportunity, because it is an important issue, of saying very plainly, and I think factually, that what has happened here is that the New South Wales government have in reality compensated irrigators for the withdrawal of their water entitlements, and we have provided some top-up funding, but they are wanting to treat the payment as income lest it be regarded as some kind of precedent for the future.I would say to the New South Wales government, through the vehicle of your question, that it would be a very good idea if you treated the payment for what it is, and the true nature of it is a capital compensation for the loss in value of a capital entitlement. That is what the tax act says. So it is not the tax act that is wrong and it is not the Australian Taxation Office that is wrong. I think the way in which this payment is being treated by the New South Wales government is wrong. I would appeal, even, to the New South Wales government to see the sense and the fairness of treating this as a capital payment. It is, and I think it is unfair to the irrigators and it would be wrong of us to twist the tax law to accommodate a payment that has been improperly described by the New South Wales government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question. I recognise and thank her for the contribution she has made to the government's deliberations off the back of the announcements that we made on 9 May to revolutionise superannuation in this country, to make it more available to young people, and to remove the complexity to make it more understandable and marketable as a savings investment vehicle for the future of this nation. The great attribute of this package is that it provides support to the self employed. Self-employed Australians under this package will be able to contribute up to $1 million over their lifetime from the sale of a small business asset which has been held for 15 years. This is over and above the announcements that we made on 9 May, and it meets some of the requirements and suggestions that were put forward by the industry and by the representatives of people who want to save for their future.From 1 July 2007, for the first time the self-employed in this country will be able to claim the same deductions for contributions made on their own behalf as contributions made on behalf of an employee by an employer. Like other Australians who have already taken advantage of the government's generous co-contribution scheme, the self-employed will also get access to the scheme, which delivers up to $1,500 into the super accounts of low- and middle-income earners as an incentive to save for their retirement.I am also asked about alternative policies in this area, and this is the most difficult part of this question because there are no alternative policies. It is happy anniversary to the Leader of the Opposition today because it is 120 days since the government made the announcement in relation to superannuation and still there is no decision from an indecisive Leader of the Opposition. There is still no decision from a person who has had four months to decide whether he is going to support people into retirement. He still has not had the ability to make up his mind. Australian people ask themselves why, after 20 years, the Leader of the Opposition stands for nothing. They still have no idea what he stands for. This is a prime example of his indecisiveness and inability to deal with economic matters.</DOC>

I think it is reasonable that we should do what we can to preserve the precious environment in the Daintree and other parts of Queensland. On the other hand, it is also reasonable to undertake development in appropriate places so that we can obtain the commercial benefits associated with tourism and growth in our economy. -  - The two are not mutually exclusive.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and for his outstanding efforts in ensuring the constituency in his electorate receive the benefit of this project. In fact, all the government members from Western Australia have supported the start of this very important project. The Australian government is firmly committed to the Perth to Bunbury project and had $150 million on the table for this project. The Prime Minister in fact announced an additional $20 million to ensure that this project started in 2006. It disturbs me greatly, and I know it disturbs the member for Canning, to read in the West Australian newspaper yesterday that the Western Australian planning minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said, when asked about a 2006 start, that she agreed it was only possible; not definite. The Australian government and the constituents in Western Australia want to know more than a possible start; they want a definite start on this project.Whilst the government members from Western Australia have been very vocal about this project, the member for Brand and Leader of the Opposition has been very quiet in his support for getting this project started. The Australian government wants this project started in 2006, and if the member for Brand wants to assist his constituents he ought to pick up the phone, ring Alannah MacTiernan and his Labor mates in Western Australia and say, 'Let's get on with this project; let's get on with building the Perth to Bunbury highway; let's get on with saving lives on Western Australian roads.'</DOC>

 - I am not personally aware of those circumstances. If the honourable member wants to provide me again with what he has put to me and anything extra I will have the matter investigated and I will give him a reply because he is entitled to it. It may well be that there has been an unlawful termination. I do not know and until I get all the details of the case I am not going to offer a view.I make two other comments. Sometimes cases of this nature that have been raised by the opposition have on closer examination turned out to be at teeny-weeny bit astray from the facts. I am not making that allegation in relation to this particular case but I was taught a long time ago 'show me your company and I will tell you who you are' in terms of political affiliations.The other point I would make is that it is now 6 September, and Work Choices was introduced on 27 March. Two predictions were made about Work Choices. One prediction was that wages would be slashed. We have seen the first returns. The early returns on that are not too encouraging for the opposition. They show that wages have gone up by two per cent over the last quarter. The second, even more important, return that has come in is that thus far we have seen 159,000 new jobs generated - the largest job generation for any quarter of the 10 years that this government has been in office. There are some employment figures coming out tomorrow. I do not know what is in them, and I will not speculate. Let me simply say that we have had three months, with 159,000. Five and a half months have now gone by and the world has not come to an end. The sky has not fallen in. Most of the claims made by the opposition have turned out to be wrong. Wages have not been driven down - in fact, they have gone up. In other words, nothing has worked out for the opposition but a lot has worked out for the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - May I thank the member for Casey for his question, for his commitment to community organisations in his electorate and also for his commitment to our government's policy of providing work opportunities for all Australians and in particular for Australians with a disability. It is all part of our policy of supporting communities and keeping the economy strong.There are 232 disability services in Australia. They provide work for over 17,000 Australians with a disability, and they do it in around 380 locations. Our government is committed to assisting those services to continue to provide employment for people with disabilities, to be viable and to expand. We do that by way of the Business Assistance Program, which is worth $99 million. We do that by way of equipment upgrades, process improvements, product development and business plans. Along with the one billion dollars which we put towards the employment of people with disabilities, it is money very well spent.Not many people would realise that the jobs people do in business services include things like packaging, assembling, gardening, manufacturing and, in particular, skills which not very many Australians gain, such as welding and the use of precision machinery. I point out to the employers of Australia that the safety and attendance records of people with disabilities are second to none.Recently I travelled to Melbourne to Waverley Industries, a business service in the electorate of the member for Chisholm, where they do precision carpentry and joinery manufacturing for use in a major chain. They won this contract because they could meet deadlines and they could deliver a finished product. Our government is helping people move from welfare to work through various ways, one of which is disability business services. Another one is the Job Network. I am very happy to be able to say that, in the last 12 months, 11,000 Australians with disabilities have been moved into open employment, which is a record - and I must congratulate the Minister for Workforce Participation. These are all part of our economic and workplace reforms - reforms which the members opposite oppose. Disability business services are enabling people with a disability to learn skills, which helps their families and certainly helps the Australian community. This builds the confidence of people with disabilities. It builds their self-esteem and enables them to go home with a pay cheque instead of a welfare cheque.</DOC>

 - Generally speaking, no. -  - In relation to the particular circumstances of the young man mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, if all of the details relating to him are supplied to me I will naturally investigate it, as I do and as I did - whilst I am on my feet - with a case put to me yesterday by the member for Prospect. I did undertake to get back to the member for Prospect, and I now do that, if I may be allowed to do so.Yesterday the member for Prospect asked a question on an alleged termination of a worker in Sydney. He asked whether I was aware that Mr Majstrovic was terminated after lodging a workers compensation claim, whether the company was trying to avoid unfair dismissal and whether I was aware that the employee only received one week's salary as compensation. I am advised that Mr Majstrovic was made redundant along with 41 other staff during July and August because of a downturn in work. I am further advised that this was not related to a workers compensation claim. Additionally, I am advised that Mr Majstrovic, rather than receiving only one week's compensation, is actually entitled to over $10,000 in compensation for being made redundant. In addition, the House might want to note that the member for Prospect also failed to mention in his question that the CFMEU has already lodged unfair dismissal and unlawful termination action challenging the redundancy claims in the AIRC for Mr Majstrovic and other workers. Finally, I understand that the company is taking defamation action against the CFMEU in relation to the matter. The Labor Party should really start addressing facts rather than asking questions with half-truths in question time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question about something that is important to all Australians - that is, the fact that figures that came out today show that our unemployment rate remains at or near a 30-year low. An additional 23,400 jobs were created in August, 22,600 of which were full-time jobs. There have now been 1.9 million new jobs created in Australia since March of 1996 and, importantly, there have been 175,800 new jobs created since the Work Choices legislation took effect in March. Far from the gloomy predictions of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten of the Australian Workers Union and Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, that the new legislation was a charter for mass sackings and mass dismissals, we have in fact seen an extraordinary strength in the Australian labour market since March of this year.The participation rate for August rose from 64.9 per cent to a record high of 65.1 per cent. The participation rate has been above 64 per cent in every month since January of last year, and only in two other months in the last 30 years has the participation rate been above 64 per cent, and that was in January and February of 2003. This record high participation rate is proof of the confidence Australians have in finding a job. More Australians than ever feel confident about looking for and finding the work of their choice. It is truly an employees' market like never before.In commenting on today's figures, the Deutsche Bank economic commentary had this to say, inter alia, and I think it bears very heavily on debate in relation to the labour market in this country:The rise in available labour is a clear trend and relates to a range of factors including an 'encouraged worker effect' and yes, some increased participation resulting from the recent Commonwealth Government reforms to industrial relations and welfare rules.In other words, this economic commentary is saying that we now have a climate which is encouraging workers, and one of the explanations for that is the combined effect of the government's industrial relations changes - you know, the ones that were going to throw millions out of work - and also the Welfare to Work rules. Which side of politics opposed both of those measures? In other words, the Australian Labor Party is against measures which, in the view of this economic commentary, have led to an encouraged worker effect.May I say to the member for Braddon that in March of 1996 the unemployment rate in his state of Tasmania was 10.1 per cent and in August of 2006 it was six per cent. In the electorate of Braddon, in March of 1996 it was 10.9 per cent and in March of this year, and it may be lower now, it was 7.2 per cent. He and other Northern Tasmanians will know only too well that if the forest policies of the other side of politics had prevailed in October of 2004 then the unemployment rate in Braddon and other parts of Northern Tasmania would have been heading back to the stratospheric levels that they arrived at in March of 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question and I note that the last two questions asked of me were from members who fought off the depredations of the destructive employment policies of the Labor Party in Northern Tasmania at the time of the last election. But let me go to the substance of the question asked by the member for Bass. The government has decided that an infantry company, which comprises about 120 soldiers currently based in Darwin, will be sent to Dili immediately to reinforce the combat capability of the ADF contingent in East Timor.There are currently approximately 930 ADF personnel in East Timor and about 180 members of the Australian Federal Police. Over the next week some 130 ADF logisticians, medical personnel and support staff will be withdrawn, their roles being substantially taken over by commercial contractors. In recent weeks the level of violence has fallen in Dili, thanks largely to excellent work by the Defence Force, the AFP and other international forces. But there is no doubt that the escape of dissident FDTL officer Reinado and 56 other hardened criminals has escalated tensions. As the foreign minister said in this place on Tuesday, Australia is willing to help, along with other members of the international community.I repeat the message to the government and people of East Timor that, whilst the government and the people of that country have a willing friend and ally in Australia, they nonetheless carry direct responsibilities for looking to their own interests. The future of that country ultimately rests in the hands of the people of East Timor. The escape of Reinado was not the fault of the Australian military. The escape of Reinado was due to the negligence of others. It was not due to the negligence and the failure of the men and women of the Australian Federal Police or the men and women of the Australian Army.It is for the people of East Timor, having fought so hard for independence, not just to take responsibility for prison security but to resolve the broader issues that face that country. They must support the rule of law, they must uphold the democratic institutions of state, they must respect their fellow citizens and genuinely work towards resolution of their political differences. As they work towards that state and those goals they can rest assured that, providing they discharge their responsibilities, they will continue to have a faithful friend and constant ally in Australia.</DOC>

 - I am quite happy to express the view that if you work for 40 hours and there are no countervailing circumstances, of course you should get paid. - In relation to the particular dispute, my advice is that there is a legal argument about the status of that dispute. If, as I expect, action is taken in the Federal Court, that legal argument will be resolved by the court. I make the point that this in no way arises from the operation of Work Choices, because there has been a prohibition on the payment of strike pay in Australian law for 10 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his interest. As he knows and as the House knows, six of the so-called Bali nine Australians who were convicted of heroin trafficking have now been sentenced to death as a result of a decision by the Indonesian Supreme Court. In answer to the honourable member's question, I make three points. First of all, our embassy officials and particularly our consulate officials in Bali will continue to work tirelessly to provide appropriate consular support to the convicted Australians. They are constantly visited by the consular staff. Over and above that, for example, yesterday my department spoke to the families of the nine and is also offering support to those families. I think in these circumstances all of our hearts go out very much to the families.The second point I make is to remind not just the House but the Australian community that trafficking in heroin is an extremely serious offence, and it is well known that in most Asian countries trafficking in heroin can bring the death sentence. All people should understand this. We cooperate with a lot of countries in the region, not least Indonesia, in trying to stop the trafficking of harmful drugs, in particular heroin, into Australia in order to protect the people of Australia. It is very important that our law enforcement agencies work closely with those of neighbouring countries, including Indonesia, to combat transnational crime, including drug trafficking but also problems like people-smuggling, terrorism and so on.The third point I would make is that the Australian government's position on capital punishment is well known. We oppose capital punishment and we always support applications for clemency for Australians, as we have done on a number of occasions over the years - the previous government and the present government. Over the years Australian governments, including our government, have been successful. We have been successful in relation to Vietnam on several occasions. The House knows only too well that we were unsuccessful in relation to Van Nguyen in Singapore last year, and there were the cases in Malaysia back in the 1980s or 1990s when the Australian government's representations were unsuccessful as well. So, it varies. But we will always support applications for clemency.The final point I make is this: the Australians who have been sentenced to death and whose sentences have now been handed down by the Supreme Court in Indonesia do have options. One of them is the option of a judicial review. Under that judicial review the Supreme Court can look at the circumstances of the conviction, details in relation to the trial and so on, and it is possible that the sentences could be reduced but it is by no means certain.Finally, once all appeals have been finalised, applications can be made for clemency. Should those applications be made, the Australian government will support those applications to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. We have no experience of President Yudhoyono's approach to these issues. We do know that he is very tough on drugs. It is a central plank of the President's platform and it is a good plank that he wants to try to eliminate drug use and trafficking in Indonesia. But his attitude to dealing with these sorts of applications for clemency is unknown, and we will just have to wait and see. I would not encourage people to have false optimism about it; I simply do not know what his approach will be.</DOC>

 - In relation to repossession, there can be a variety of reasons why repossessions might fluctuate over a period of time. The point I made yesterday relating to housing affordability - and of course it is impossible to separate the issue of housing affordability from the issue of repossession - is something that I repeat today -  - and that is that the major cause of the increase in the unaffordability of the first home for young Australians has undeniably been the price of land. - My point simply is that it is harder for young Australians to buy their first home, and the major reasons for that are the cost of land due to the restrictive land release policies of state governments and the way in which state governments are using the development process as a revenue-raising device. - If you look at the figures in relation to the city of Sydney, those figure show very clearly that in the 30-year period between -  - I simply conclude by reminding the House again that between 1973 and 2003 the cost of land in Sydney rose by 700 per cent and the cost of building rose by about four per cent in real terms. Fifteen years ago interest rates were double what they are now. It is therefore beyond logical argument that the principal reasons for the problem young Australians now have are the land release policies of state governments and the way in which they use the development process as a way of extorting revenue from young people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question because today we have had two pieces of very important economic data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Not only, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, have we seen the creation of more than 1,000 jobs each and every day since Work Choices came into operation - more than a thousand jobs a day being created in Australia since Work Choices - but the ABS data also show that we have the lowest level of industrial disputation since records were kept. And can I indicate to the House that the first time records were kept in relation to industrial disputation in Australia was in 1913, before our troops went to Gallipoli. We now have an industrial disputation level in Australia of 3.1 working days lost per thousand employees. The highest rate in Australia was 104.6 working days lost per thousand employees. - That was in December 1992 - and guess who was then the minister for employment in Australia? The minister for employment in Australia was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, when we had the highest level of industrial disputation in Australia.The member for Hasluck asked me about the impact in terms of his electorate. I can reveal that the unemployment rate for his electorate in the March quarter of this year - the latest figures on the electorate breakdown of the unemployment rate - was 4.3 per cent. I spoke about the time when we had the highest level of industrial disputation. The unemployment rate in the electorate of Hasluck at that time - again, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment in Australia, responsible, one would have hoped, for creating jobs but indeed, as it turned out historically, responsible for destroying jobs in Australia - was 10.9 per cent. I say to the member for Hasluck and, through him, to the constituents of the seat of Hasluck in Western Australia -  - here is the comparison between the two: 104 working days lost per thousand employees and a 10.9 per cent unemployment rate or, today, 3.1 working days lost per thousand employees and an unemployment rate in Hasluck of 4.3 per cent. This is quite clear: it is good news for the electors of Hasluck; it is good news for the people of Australia. It is good news because this is a government which has presided over a strong economy in this country. And, ultimately, it is that strength of the Australian economy which has led to that wonderful increase in jobs over the last five months in Australia, something which all Australians will benefit from.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Fowler: I certainly do remember saying that to Neil Mitchell, and it is true. I have never heard anybody complain about the value of their house. The point I am making is that, if you are to have a market that operates fairly for young homebuyers, you have to remove some of the artificial barriers to entry. We cannot have a society that is only run for the benefit of existing homebuyers and shuts out opportunity for intending homebuyers. That is not the kind of Australia that this electorate wants, and I want to say on behalf of the coalition that we want an Australia that allows young people a reasonable opportunity to buy their first home. - That is what we are on about. The Leader of the Opposition can shout as much as he likes. Nothing can alter the fact that if you do not have a reasonable supply of land, if you continue to use the development process to raise revenue rather than governments discharging their responsibilities of providing roadworks, sewerage and guttering, the sorts of basic infrastructure that ought to be provided by government, you are going to continue to shut young homebuyers out of an opportunity of buying their homes. I know the Labor Party is run by inner urban elites, but I would have hoped that they might have had some sensitivity to the young of this country who want to buy a home and who find it necessary to go to the outer periphery of Sydney in order to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa represents an area that generates significant quantities of cotton exports out of Australia. One of the issues that is most important to the cotton industry is a reliable supply of and access to water. Just to give you an idea of the importance of the export industry that they have grown, this year they have topped $1.1 billion worth of exports of cotton out of Australia. Cotton is now Australia's seventh-largest agricultural export -  - and a lot of that would be coming out of the electorate of Maranoa. It is interesting to note where the strongest growth has been. China is now becoming one of Australia's largest fibre markets for both wool and cotton, because cotton exports to China last financial year rose by a staggering 307 per cent. So just over a half a billion dollars - $506 million - worth of exports of cotton have gone to China, along with exports to Indonesia worth $250 million, and Thailand, $157 million.As I said, this industry relies very heavily on the reliability of access to water. Many of the state Labor governments are not cognisant of this fact, particularly in Queensland - the member for Maranoa comes from Queensland - where the Beattie Labor government -  - are proposing to arbitrarily levy a $4 a megalitre water tax on industry in Queensland. - Cotton Australia has come out and said, and very sensibly so, that irrigators must not be asked to bear the cost of water reform alone. They recognise that they have to share the responsibility, but they should not have to bear it alone - and that is the view of the Beattie Labor government in Queensland. So, whilst the federal coalition government -  - has been removing taxes from exports -  - with $3 billion worth of taxes taken off the backs of exporters as a result of our tax reform policy a number of years ago, and continuing to reduce the levels of income tax, state Labor governments are lazily increasing taxes on our export industries. This should be an issue in the Queensland election on Saturday, because the Beattie Labor government wants to levy a $4 a megalitre tax on irrigators in Queensland.</DOC>

 - The question asked by the member for Calare clearly relates to the announcement I made today in relation to some proposed changes to the law concerning the superannuation entitlements of members of parliament first elected in the 2004 election and some, in some circumstances, elected in 2001. I should say that it is a proposal that has the express support of the opposition. What is happening is that members of parliament in that category are to be treated in the same way as Commonwealth public servants and indeed in the same way as members of their staff.I know that it is easy to criticise any alteration which in any way enhances the remuneration of members of parliament. I do not believe that the great bulk of members of parliament in this place are overpaid. I think most people who come into this place come in with a sincere commitment to serve the people of Australia according to their philosophy. I believe that if we continue to take the populist route on this issue we will trash the gene pool of potential entrants to this parliament. I do not want to see the parliament of this nation filled with trade union officials, political staffers or careerist political figures who have had no acquaintance at all -  
Opposition members - Or lawyers! - I want it filled with a cross-section of this nation, and I am very proud of the fact that in the last election, in 2004, an astonishing range of the abilities and talents of the Australian people entered the national parliament on my side. I defend this decision and I will be interested to hear that the Leader of the Opposition also endorses what he has indicated to me privately.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. We are - I think it is next Monday - five years on from 9-11, in which 10 Australians were killed. It is nearly four years since 88 Australians were killed in Bali. We are two days from the second anniversary of the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta and we are pretty close to the first anniversary of the so-called second Bali bombing. In that circumstance, we obviously remember very much those who were killed. We mourn those who have died and we share the pain of the families of those who were killed. We recommit ourselves to the struggle against terrorism; to doing all we can as a country; to trying, in working with our allies and our friends, to bring terrorists to justice; and to stopping acts of terror.There is, of course, no country on earth more important in this fight against terrorism than the United States of America, and, as the honourable member said in his question, President Bush made a speech overnight about some of the successes that have been achieved through a CIA program of detention and questioning. Information from one detainee in this program has been important to Australia because it led to the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was the al-Qaeda linkman with Jemaah Islamiah, and Hambali, who was the Jemaah Islamiah linkman with al-Qaeda. It was Hambali who helped to plan and was really the mastermind behind the first Bali bombing.Others detained in this program include one of Hambali's key lieutenants, who facilitated the transfer of al-Qaeda funds which funded the Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta in 2003. In addition to that, information from these detainees also led to the capture of Hambali's brother and the closure of a Jemaah Islamiah cell in Pakistan - and it told us a good deal about al-Qaeda's plans to obtain biological weapons capability. That came through a Jemaah Islamiah member.I mention all that because a great deal has been achieved through these kinds of programs. President Bush announced that the 14 terrorist suspects in the CIA program are now being transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where they will be held in detention, pending prosecution by the United States Department of Defense, along with around 450 others who are already there. He has also sent to congress legislation to authorise the creation of a military commission to try these people. Once the congress acts to authorise these commissions, those who are believed to have orchestrated acts of terror or to be associated with acts of terror, or are alleged to have committed war crimes or attempted to murder people will of course be charged and prosecuted before the military commissions.I can simply state that, for all the criticism of the United States that you sometimes get in this country and internationally on the actions it is taking in the fight against terrorism and the controversy about these particular sorts of measures, it is important to bring them back home, bring them back to the war against terrorism in our immediate region and understand how important it has been to get information from detainees that has led to the capture and, in some cases, the killing of terrorists who might have otherwise killed innocent people.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the claims by the honourable member for Brisbane - indeed, Senator Ian Campbell in the other place said that passengers departing Ballina are not subject to any kind of scrutiny. The Mayor of Ballina, Councillor Silver, and many others in the Ballina region this morning were in the local newspaper to make it abundantly clear that the claims by the honourable member for Brisbane and Senator Campbell are in fact wrong. They are false. The reality is that Ballina has jet services and those passengers are checked in the normal way to ensure that there are no security issues. - On those passengers who are not on jet services: we have responded to the Wheeler report and his recommendation that there be greater scrutiny when those passengers arrive in Sydney. Indeed, those passengers are now bussed to the airport terminal building and are kept under scrutiny at all times. We have accepted all of the Wheeler committee recommendations, including those in relation to regional aviation. The claims by the Leader of the Opposition and others that we have not responded to that recommendation are completely false. We have fulfilled the recommendations entirely.The Leader of the Opposition has also been guilty on many occasions of verballing Sir John in relation to his recommendations concerning regional airports. Sir John recognised that there would be different standards of security provided at different airports and that this should happen on the basis of a risk assessment. We have done the risk assessment, we have responded completely to the Wheeler recommendations and that applies also to passengers out of Ballina.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question, and I certainly acknowledge his ferocious advocacy for health services in his area and elsewhere. As far as the Howard government is concerned, country people will never be second-class citizens when it comes to health care.Since 1996 the Howard government has announced four new medical schools outside capital cities. It has established 14 rural clinical schools. It has established 11 university departments of rural health. The government is making rural retention payments of up to $25,000 a year to nearly 2,000 doctors. It has subsidised the employment of more than 1,100 nurses in country general practice. It has recently doubled the incentive payments to country GPs who are doing anaesthetics, obstetrics and minor surgery. As a result of these and other measures, there are now nearly seven per cent more doctors in Australia overall on a full-time workforce equivalent basis, but nearly 25 per cent more doctors in country areas. On a headcount basis, the number of doctors practising in country areas has increased from 5,400 in 1996 to 6,900 now. In the seat of Blair, the number of doctors has gone from 80 in 1996 to 105 today, thanks in part to the policies of the Howard government.By contrast, most of the states have neglected country hospitals - in particular, by closing down rural maternity units. And, as usual, the state of Queensland is the worst offender. Since 1998 the Beattie government has closed - would you believe this? - 36 out of 84 public maternity units. Forty per cent of the maternity units in the state of Queensland have been closed down by the Beattie government. As well as Kilcoy and Gatton in the electorate of Blair, these centres have lost their maternity units: Weipa, Ingham, Bowen, Collinsville, Winton, Yeppoon, Maryborough and Beaudesert, as well as many others. All have lost their maternity units thanks to the negligence and the neglect of the Beattie government.Premier Beattie is saying, 'Re-elect me to fix the Queensland health system.' Why would you elect to fix the system a man who broke the system in the first place? - Re-electing Premier Beattie to fix health would be like putting Al Capone in charge of the FBI!The member for Lalor then left the chamber. - The Queensland election is rightly a referendum on the state of Queensland's public hospitals, and I suggest that the citizens of those towns that have lost their maternity service should pass appropriate judgment on the Beattie government this Saturday.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Brisbane has once again misquoted from the Wheeler report. Since he has given me this opportunity, and I have found the relevant quote, let me read to the House paragraph 47 of the Sir John Wheeler report on regional aviation.The member for Melbourne Ports then left the chamber. - The report said:It is neither practical nor desirable to expect 100 per cent security at regional airports. The sheer diversity of Australia's regional airports makes the challenge of common standards of security an impossibility. - It continues:Any protective security enhancements should be undertaken in accordance with a local threat and risk assessment and not instituted on the basis of what is sometimes media-driven scaremongering. - Indeed, I perhaps could add, from my own words, opposition-driven scaremongering. The Labor Party has proposed as an alternative to the risk managed systems that we have put in place - The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - The opposition has proposed, as an alternative to the carefully costed and properly risk managed proposals implemented by this government to upgrade security around Australia, that every airport in Australia should be equipped with security measures similar to those at our capital city airports. - The opposition have proposed that there should be passenger security measures similar to those we have in our capital cities to check every passenger and all baggage in every airport in Australia. The opposition have repeated that statement frequently. As I said to the House a couple of days ago, it has been estimated that the average cost of providing this kind of security at every airport in Australia would be $5 million per airport.The member for Swan then left the chamber. - At some of these 170 airports, there could be as few as 10 or a dozen passengers a week, but Labor is proposing that these airports be required to install $5 million worth of security equipment. All of that cost would be passed back to the passengers by way of a loading on their tickets. That is what the Labor Party are proposing. - Their proposal is to spend $5 million on security equipment for individual passenger checking facilities and baggage X-ray facilities at each of these airports. This would add thousands - indeed, tens of thousands of dollars - to the cost of tickets for flights out of airports in many parts of regional Australia. That would be a recipe for closing down airports. We do not believe that is a reasonable response. That is not in conformity with what Sir John Wheeler recommended. He recommended that security be provided appropriate to the risks in each instance. In the case of an airport like Dubbo, which does not have jet services and therefore individual passengers are not screened unless there is a particular risk assessment that suggests it needs to be done -  - In that instance, when the passengers arrive in Sydney, they are now met by a bus. - They are bussed under supervision to the terminal building, where they go through security if they are entering or going on to a sector which will involve jet travel. Sir John Wheeler's recommendations have been responded to effectively and completely by this government, and that has delivered a much higher level of security for the passengers of Australia than ever existed when Labor was in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I acknowledge his support for the $1 billion Investing in Our Schools program. Let me share with the House just a couple of stories that we have been told by Queensland government schools about what state they are in. There is a Queensland government school that has damaged walls and has been waiting to repair those walls because they contain asbestos. There is asbestos in the walls at this Queensland government school. That has had to turn to the federal government to ensure that it could get support to fund the repair of those walls. How long would that school have had to continue to wait before the Queensland government stepped in and took responsibility? We will never know.There is a state government school in Queensland where the basketball court surface is considered so dangerous that it has been classed as out of bounds for all students. How long would that state government school have had to wait for the Beattie government to step in and repair that basketball court so that students could use it? But, again, they have turned to the federal government for support under the Investing in Our Schools program.So, as the Beattie government abandons the basic needs in Queensland government schools, the Australian government has already provided $57 million to over 800 Queensland state government schools. The member for Bonner will be pleased to know that in his electorate some $1.6 million has been provided, in the electorate of Leichhardt, some $2.3 million. The member for Capricornia would be relieved to know that $2.6 million has been provided for her electorate by the Australian government. And the member for Lilley, welcome back! In his electorate some $1.7 million was provided, in the member for Griffith's electorate, $1.6 million.We have 2,000 more applications from Queensland government schools for the federal government to provide basic infrastructure funding. So here we have the federal government stepping in to do the clean-up work left by the Queensland state government, and Mr Beattie is just pushing onto the federal government the asbestos problems in state government schools. It is time that Queenslanders sent a message to the Beattie government. It is time that the state government supported Queensland government schools.</DOC>

 - This government have arranged for security wands to be available at all of the regional airports carrying regular passenger transport services and we have trained several hundred people to be able to use them in the event of their being required. So when, in fact, there is an upgrade in the security threat from the current low level at a regional airport, at a moment's notice these people can be brought to an airport and used to undertake the appropriate security arrangements. So, effectively, we respond to the security threat as it is at the time.Again, however, the honourable member for Brisbane has dishonestly misrepresented Sir John Wheeler's recommendations. Sir John Wheeler did not recommend that wands be used at every country airport. He did not recommend that baggage be screened or, indeed, that passengers be screened. In fact, he only made one recommendation about regional airports at all. That is recommendation 15, in which he suggested that the Department of Transport and Regional Services should offer appropriate and increased security oriented training and guidance and be in communications with airports to survey and help discern their security needs. We have done that. Each of these airports has developed a security plan. We have provided funding to help them with basic security measures -  - and to train their staff to be able to deal with an emergency should it arise. This government has responded faithfully and completely to Sir John Wheeler's recommendations and, as a result, delivered a much higher level of security for passengers in regional Australia than ever existed under Labor. And we have done it in an affordable way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gwydir for his question and acknowledge his personal commitment over many years towards transport infrastructure in Australia and his particular effort and interest in the prospects of constructing an inland railway in Australia to link Melbourne and Brisbane. As he would be aware, this afternoon I released the study by consultants Ernst and Young into the economics and the transport needs on the rail sector for our eastern states for the next couple of decades.This study has identified the fact that the rail sector will have to play an increasing role in our transport task in the years ahead. The transport role between our major capitals - Brisbane-Sydney, Sydney-Melbourne and Brisbane-Melbourne - will double over the next 20 to 25 years. That means twice as many trucks, twice as many trains and twice as many ships to be able to achieve the task, otherwise our economies will start to strangle as a result of an inability to move products around as quickly as we need to.I think most of us believe that our roads system, even with the substantial investment that this government is providing, will not be able to cope with a doubling of the number of trucks. So rail will need to play an increasingly important role. Rail has a reputation - unfortunately correctly earned - for being unreliable and not on time. We have to fix that, and the $2.4 billion that this government is committing to upgrading the Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne rail line will, hopefully, make a significant step in this regard.The report has recognised that that expenditure has been appropriately targeted and will deliver good results. I commend the honourable member for Gwydir for his role in the choice of some of those projects. It does recognise that we will then need to do something about the worst bottleneck in the Australian transport system, and that is getting freight in and out of Sydney. That needs to be dealt with promptly. That will require at least another $1.5 billion in capital expenditure north of Sydney. But, by 2019, even that enhanced route will not be sufficient to meet the task. In that regard, an inland railway line linking Melbourne and Brisbane will be required by that time.The report goes on to identify potential routes, looks at the economics of the various proposals and I think demonstrates that this proposal will be required, that it is affordable and that it can play a very significant role in delivering Australia's transport tasks into the future. Now there is an opportunity for the public to comment on these proposals, and I invite anyone who is interested in this important national project to make a contribution. This will be an important national vision that we can fulfil, and I believe that this report represents a significant step forward in this project.</DOC>

 - May I take the second part of the answer first. I saw over the weekend the Leader of the Opposition talking about a new proposal he had for collective bargaining. He did not provide much detail of it to me, but I really did not need him to do that because I had had the benefit some months ago of a discussion with the secretary of the ACTU. He told me what good faith bargaining, a la the Labor Party and the Australian trade union movement, meant. What he basically said was that, if you have a workplace where a majority of people vote in favour of a collective agreement, that would mean that a collective agreement would be forced on every member of that workplace. I was told that this is what happened in the United States. I was a little surprised at the reference to the United States because I thought we never followed anything in the industrial relations area or the social welfare area that came from the United States.What the Leader of the Opposition has in mind in relation to collective bargaining would strike at the right of businesses to run their own businesses. It would deny freedom of choice to employers and employees. It demonstrates again that he does not have a commitment to the policies that are needed to maintain the prosperity of the Australian economy.And that brings me to the first part of the honourable member's question. Let me simply say to him: the reason why we have had almost two million jobs created in the last 10 years, the reason why in the last six months we have had 175,000 new jobs created since Work Choices came into operation, the reason why industrial disputes are now at their record low level since statistics began to be collected and the reason why workers' wages have gone up by 16.4 per cent in real terms since this government came to power is the combination of this government's economic policies and the relentless commitment of this government to maintaining and extending the prosperity of the Australian people.The problem with the Leader of the Opposition's proposal in relation to collective bargaining is that it would take us back to the rigidity of the Keating era, when more than a million Australians lost their jobs. It is not a recipe to spur prosperity; it is a recipe to retard prosperity. It is a recipe to take away the right of managers to manage and it would deny the freedom of choice now available to Australian workers.</DOC>

 - The people who chose in the Boeing case - and I met some of these men - to go on strike were the men themselves. They could have returned without any kind of penalty. I am also reminded by the minister for workplace relations that, ironically enough, in this particular case two-thirds of the employees did not want the collective agreement. - So apparently it is all right for the majority to rule, if the majority rules the right way - and that is the Combet-Beazley way. But if the majority goes in the other direction it is: 'Oh, this is dreadful. We're being forced into a debilitating industrial dispute.' What you want in the workplace is freedom of choice. You want freedom of the individual. That is what has made this country great and that is what will maintain its prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. As he and other members of the House know, since the introduction of Work Choices we have seen 175,000 jobs created in Australia - great news for Australian families; great news for Australian workers - and, at the same time, wages have continued to grow in this country and industrial disputation has fallen to the lowest level on record. So this is great news for Australians and great news for the economy.As the Prime Minister indicated in answer to an earlier question, over the weekend we had the Leader of the Opposition quietly slip out a policy which amounts to sheer economic vandalism of this country. This compulsory union bargaining policy means, in effect, that union officials would be able to march into any business in Australia and demand to have a collective agreement put in place. As part of this process which Mr Combet and those in the trade union movement have been outlining, they would be able to seek to open up the financial affairs and the books of account of all these businesses as well. That is what compulsory union bargaining under the Labor Party means. Let us make no bones about this: this will be a job-destroying move if it is ever implemented in Australia.Not only that, there is a great contradiction in what the Leader of the Opposition says. On one hand he says, 'If a majority of employees want to have a collective agreement, then we'll legislate to allow them.' But just remember what else he said: 'If a majority of employees want to have an individual Australian workplace agreement, we'll ban them.' So there is not even any internal logic in this place. We have to ask why is it -  - This is an important interjection. He says, 'You all know that they can have a common law contract.' Anybody who knows labour relations 101 knows that a common law contract involves the terms of the award. So what he is saying is -  -  - They can laugh. -  - Well done! He has just shown, by either his connivance or his sheer ignorance, that a common law contract in his language means the old award system. So this is either a collective agreement that is demanded or an award going back to the Keating days of industrial relations in Australia - going back to the 104 working days lost per 1,000 employees when he was minister for employment; going back to the 10.9 per cent unemployment rate when this man was allegedly responsible for employment in this country.But why is he doing this? This is the most important question. The member for Franklin let the cat out of the bag last week. I think most people regard the member for Franklin as a decent and honourable man, and he let the cat out of the bag. He said that the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition was under pressure from the mates in the New South Wales Right. What happened? A few months ago, John Robertson from Unions New South Wales started a campaign against the Leader of the Opposition. So the Leader of the Opposition rushed off to their conference and said, 'We'll rip up Australian workplace agreements.' Now there is another campaign against the Leader of the Opposition, which the member for Franklin has honestly told us about, and the Leader of the Opposition has gone out once again and said, 'I'll do the bidding of the unions in New South Wales.' This has nothing to do with the national interest; it would destroy the national interest. This is simply about looking after the vested interests of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I am aware in general terms of this situation. I am aware that the company mentioned by the member for Fraser has won the contract from another company. I am also aware that the former company employed many people under an AWA - though not all of them. It is the right of an employer to decide how to manage his business. In a free enterprise society, employers do have the right, subject to the law, to manage their businesses. This proposition that the government should tell somebody who has invested their capital in starting a business how to manage it and micromanage their business for them is not a proposition that I accept. The purpose of industrial relations legislation is to set a framework, and within that framework businesses should be able to manage their own business -  - and employees, if they wish, should be able to negotiate. Under this government, both employers and employees have more freedom of choice than they did under the former government. If the Labor Party were to win the next election, it is obvious that the Leader of the Opposition, from what he has said over the weekend and today, would be hell-bent on going back to a situation where managers will be denied the right to manage their own businesses. That is a recipe for reducing the entrepreneurial spirit of this country. It is a recipe for returning to the days when real wages hardly moved at all. I say not only to workers employed by a particular company but, indeed, to workers all around Australia: look at how your real wages have increased under this government and compare that with what happened when presumably you were living in the nirvana of the workers under the former Labor government. There is no comparison. - What the Leader of the Opposition has conveniently done today is to remind us that good faith collective bargaining is to hand back control of industrial relations to the union movement of this country. We now know that Greg Combet was deadly serious when he said in Adelaide, 'The unions used to run this country and it wouldn't be a bad idea if they started doing so again.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. He is very concerned about these issues and often speaks about them. First, in answer to the honourable member's question, let me say that we were saddened to hear of the death of the governor of Paktia province in Afghanistan, Hakim Taniwal, who was killed yesterday by a Taliban suicide bomber. He was an Australian citizen. He came to Australia in order to flee from oppression in his country and he returned to Afghanistan in 2002 to contribute to the rebuilding of his country of birth. I would like to extend our condolences to his family in Melbourne. It is a truly sad thing that someone who became an Australian citizen has died in these tragic circumstances, finding his country of birth liberated - a country that was free but a country still under a good deal of pressure.Today, on 11 September, this is a reminder for all of us that the fight against terrorism is going to continue on a number of fronts. It is also a reminder that Muslims who stand up for democracy and freedom are targeted just as much as, if not more than, Westerners and Western interests.By the end of 2006, there will be over 300 Australian troops in Afghanistan. We are determined to play our part in denying the terrorists a safe haven and to support the democratically elected government of President Karzai to ensure that we are able to see democracy and freedom flourish in that country. Our first resident ambassador leaves Australia this week. He will lead the new embassy which we are just in the process of opening in Kabul.In Iraq, also, Australia is continuing to play its part in confronting the terrorists and supporting democracy. In our region, our government has very much led the way in cooperation against terrorism. Our counter-terrorism initiatives since 2004 are worth over $400 million. We have a network of 12 counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding which underpin our cooperation, and this cooperation is delivering results. Over 300 terrorists have been tracked down and arrested in South-East Asia in recent times.Finally, today we remember the Australians who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Indonesia, in the United States on September 11, in Iraq, in the United Kingdom on 7 July last year, in Afghanistan and indeed elsewhere. We want to take the opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Australian soldiers, the Australian police and even officers of my department who stare down the threat of terrorism every day of their lives in extremely difficult and often very dangerous circumstances.I think all members of the House know that this government will continue to confront these extremists and to confront their ideology. Very importantly - and let me say this in the presence of the British Lord Chancellor, a member of the British cabinet - we will continue to work with our friends and our allies, including our very traditional allies of Great Britain and the United States of America, in confronting and ultimately defeating terrorism.</DOC>

 - My position on this has not been to repeatedly defend the company. Rather, my position has been to repeatedly point out that the argument made by the Labor Party and the unions - that the retrenchment of these workers was due entirely to the operation of the new Work Choices legislation - was wrong. That is the argument. It may come as a blinding flash of light and new reality to the member for Perth for me to tell him that companies have lost money, gone broke and retrenched workers under every industrial relations system this nation has had since Federation. If in fact there has been something wrong in the behaviour of the company, I would invite the member for Perth - and anybody else who is interested - to take that matter up with the relevant body, which is ASIC.My position is very simple. The argument advanced by the unions and the Labor Party all along in relation to this company has been 'It's all been due to Work Choices'. The evidence to date is that that claim is wrong. If the unions and the Labor Party have any evidence to the contrary, they should give it to ASIC. The reality to date is that what the Labor Party has been arguing is completely false.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his preparliamentary profession, committed to law and justice, particularly in policing. When the government came to office in 1996 and inherited a $10 billion deficit from the previous government, one of the first things it did not do was cut Australian Defence Force expenditure. In fact, over the last decade, this government's investment in defence has increased in real terms by more than 40 per cent. In addition to that, $900 million a year has been shifted from the back end of Defence to the front.On 11 September five years ago, the lives of many of us were bisected into the half that was lived before those heinous events from Islamic terrorism and the half that has come since. Amongst that government expenditure in defence over the last five years has been $752 million in increased investment which has brought a tactical assault group to the eastern part of Australia to specifically provide a rapid response in counter-terrorism; an incident response regiment to focus specifically on nuclear, chemical and biological threats and incidents; and a special operations command, staffed principally by 330 specialist combat trained Defence Force personnel, to coordinate anti-terrorist capability in Defence and coordinate operations.In this year alone, with the budget and announcements made since, this government has committed an additional $26 billion in defence expenditure over the next decade, which will include the establishment of two more battalions of 2,600 more light infantry soldiers. The government also announced, late last year, another 1,500 soldiers, supported by, amongst other things, 59 heavy Abrams tanks. Next year we will also make a decision about building three air warfare destroyers which, amongst other things, will give Australia the option of mobile anti-ballistic-missile capability.It is also important for us to appreciate that, if it were the case on 11 September five years ago, anyone who thought that protection of Australia's people, interests and values began and ended at our borders would have had that illusion shattered. Defending Australia is about what happens in our region and it is also about what happens in the rest of the world. The war against terror and the global struggle against Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism needs to be fought as much in Afghanistan and Iraq as it does in our region or, indeed, on our borders. We need to appreciate that Muklas, Hambali and Samudra - and others who planned to kill and killed innocent Australians in Bali - trained in Afghanistan. This is a long war in which we are engaged to see that the next generation is able to live free from this kind of terrorist behaviour and this kind of heinous terrorist fear. We need to understand that this is a cause we need to take up and that the government has well and truly invested in the future security of Australians.</DOC>

 - I have seen the reports in the weekend press, and my understanding of those figures is that they do not relate solely to dwellings; they also include actions to repossess properties involved commercially, and it is not possible on the figures available in the media to know precisely how many of those relate to homes. He asks me a question relating to interest rates. It is true that interest rates rose by 0.25 per cent recently, and there have been three interest rate rises in the last 18 months. I acknowledge that. That is a statement of fact. The other statement of fact is -  - under the former government, the housing interest rate averaged 12¾ per cent. It peaked at 17 per cent - 17 per cent! Can you imagine how many repossessions there would be now were it 17 per cent, Mr Speaker? Let me assure the member for Werriwa that any government would be concerned about any repossessions, but the proposition that housing affordability now is a function of the interest rate rises that have occurred since the last election is false. I notice that in this morning's press there are a few things attributed to an interview given by the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank. He had something to say about housing affordability when he appeared before the House of Representatives standing committee on 18 August. He was asked a question about houses being less affordable. -  -  In the case of the Manager of Opposition Business, who makes a point of order, I would have thought a question about repossession action does relate to housing affordability. This is what he had to say about houses being less affordable. This could be a very good answer for the member for Werriwa:Mr Macfarlane - They are. That is caused more than 100 per cent by the fact that house prices have gone up, not because of interest rates going up. Interest rates are lower than they were 10 years ago and are obviously lower than they were 15 years ago.Dr EMERSON - that is the member for Rankin - But affordability is no different?Mr Macfarlane - The story is all about house prices. The story is not about interest rates.End of story.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question because obviously the member for Deakin is far more interested in the security of Australia and the Australian people than some of those who have been interjecting opposite. But, as reminded by the Prime Minister, today marks five years since -  - Perhaps you might like to be quiet and listen. -  - As I said a moment ago, September 11 tragically represented the loss of too many innocent lives at the hands of terrorists, and those events changed the security environment forever. This government is committed to the safety of Australia and Australians.The opposition would have us believe that a new department of homeland security would offer a magic answer to all security concerns. Unfortunately, administrative restructure would offer nothing in the way of new policy and ignores the excellent cooperative arrangements that underpin our security arrangements that are in place here in Australia today. As the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty, acknowledged in a radio interview only yesterday, there exists a very high level of cooperation between relevant agencies here in Australia.Fortunately for Australians, this government is committed to implementing practical measures to improve security. We have committed over $8.3 billion over 10 years, enhancing national security arrangements. We have increased the resourcing of our security agency ASIO - an increase in the order of a quarter of a million dollars in this financial year. We have identified critical infrastructure assets at greatest risk, and we have worked in partnership with the business community to protect those most vital assets.Our counter-terrorism exercise program is one of the most comprehensive in the world. It attracts observers from around the globe to Australia when those exercises occur. The national security hotline has proven to be a very considerable success, with over 83,000 calls since it commenced operation in 2002. Many of those calls have led to very fruitful lines of inquiries for appropriate agencies. On the legislative front, we have refined and adapted our laws in response to the experience and relevant developments we have seen abroad.While the government cannot offer a guarantee that a terrorist act will not occur in Australia, we are clearly committed to protecting our citizens here and abroad. Our law enforcement and security agencies have the resources and the tools, and I am sure all members of this House would join me in recognising their professionalism at the front line in the fight against terrorism.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I know my hearing is bad, but I thought the member for Lilley said that any new land releases would have an effect on the value of the family home. - You have been caught out. The shadow Treasurer is saying that any land release will have an effect on the value of the family home. I have in fact seen what Mr Alan Moran said. I saw it on Lateline, late on Friday night. - No, I took it in calmly, and I thought, 'I'll bet that's a selective grab.' Of course, on 6PR, he qualified his comments. He said, 'Well, I'm not suggesting there's going to be open slather.' Of course there is not. Obviously, if you decided to hurl vast tracts of land onto the market, of course it would have an impact. Nobody is arguing that. What I have in mind are modest proposals - and they were modest proposals; they came from the Australian Labor Party, actually. That is why I know they are modest! This is what Jenny Macklin had to say - and this was when they were interested in young home buyers:Let's also work with State Governments to make sure that we get adequate land release -  -  - Do I assume that the value of the family home in Sydney is now going to go down if we adopt those policies? She continued:... that we get proper urban development, regional development, that we address this issue as broadly as possible.On 15 March, Kim Carr not only called on the states but also on the Commonwealth to make a contribution. The reality is that the policies of the state governments have contributed to the very issue drawn attention to by the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. Of course, it is well known that agricultural exports are a very important component of Australia's overall export earning effort. Figures released on Friday show that in the month of July agricultural exports rose by two per cent. Foremost amongst those were exports of grains, which were up $22 million or five per cent; and wool, which increased by $16 million or seven per cent. Notwithstanding those results in July, the major threats to our ability to earn more income from agricultural exports are probably climatic conditions and the advent of drought. As the member for Riverina would know from her own area, drought has been a significant handbrake on agricultural production in this country for almost a decade in different parts across Australia. We need to recognise that and always be prepared to help out our agricultural producers.Interestingly, at the moment 98 per cent of New South Wales is either in drought or marginally getting close to being in drought. Irrigators in the Goulburn system in Victoria's food bowl have been allocated only 17 per cent of their water rights at this stage, and more than 60 per cent of Queensland has been drought declared. Obviously, the greatest impediment to increasing our agricultural exports is drought, and it is something that none of us have any control over. But we do have some control over the level of assistance that we are able to give to Australia's farmers. Forecasters were predicting last week that this year's grain crops may only be half the size of last year's, and that will have a profound impact on Australia's exports of that product next year.As a result of drought the Australian government has provided over $1.1 billion in direct welfare and business support to farmers through the exceptional circumstances program administered by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. That has assisted 53,000 applications from drought ravaged parts of Australia. It is a very important program that helps people get back on their feet very quickly and back into the production cycle to make that very important contribution to Australia's export effort. The coalition government recognises the ongoing impact of drought on farm families in rural communities and we will continue to support them during these difficult times when they are being dramatically affected by the impact of drought.</DOC>

The question reads as follows:Did you think their line was defensible, within the context of an election?This is what he said:Ah, well it was logically defensible, yes. It was a logically defensible position. - Then he goes on to say that it was disappointing. I simply say to the member for Lilley that if he wants to quote the Reserve Bank governor on this issue, quote him in full and do not be selective.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I note in passing that there are already 30 schools in his electorate that have taken advantage of the government's Healthy School Communities grants to improve the diets in their school canteens. As everyone knows, prevention is better than cure, and the government is building a health system which does not just treat illness but which promotes wellness too. The government wants our system to anticipate problems and to treat these early. We are doing this through a series of health checks which are now funded under Medicare. Since 1999 people over 75 have been able to access annual health checks under Medicare, and I am pleased that some one-quarter of a million people accessed such a check in the last year.Indigenous people of all ages are able to access biannual health checks under Medicare. In the last year almost 20,000 Indigenous people did so. From 1 November, everyone turning 45 with risk factors will be able to access a comprehensive health check funded by Medicare. As well, Medicare is now funding more comprehensive treatment for people with chronic diseases. In the first year of its operation, some 650,000 GP management plans were put into practice. In the last financial year there were some 250,000 team care plans for people with complex care needs, and there were a half a million allied health consultations under these plans, which was double that of the previous year. These are not the end but the beginning of changes which this government is making to promote good health. This government will continue to support incremental changes to make our great Medicare system even better.</DOC>

 - I have seen a summary of that and I am aware of the broad thrust comprised in that report. I have no argument with acting in relation to climate change. My disagreement is in relation to the desirability of this country signing up to the Kyoto protocol because I think it is in the interests of the nation to revise one's view about something that you may have held in 1997, which is nine years ago. The truth is that if Australia were to sign Kyoto in its present form it would assume burdens -  - not assumed by countries like China and Indonesia. As a result it would be more economic for investments carrying the creation of thousands of jobs to be made in countries like China and Indonesia rather than in Australia. That, in a nutshell, is the reason why we are not in favour of signing Kyoto. We are in favour, and we are giving effect to the favour, of encouraging investment in technologies that will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel. We have signed up to the Asia-Pacific partnership for development and energy. Kyoto was essentially constructed by the Europeans to suit the Europeans. - It was not constructed in order to accommodate the legitimate interests of a developed country which is a large net exporter of energy, which is the case with Australia. So I would say in reply to the business roundtable, as I would say in reply to other people who raise this issue, that those who believe that you have answered the call and deserve a tick in relation to climate change by signing up to Kyoto misunderstand the national interest of this country. I am never going to support something that will result in Australian industry and Australian jobs being exported from Australia to countries like China and Indonesia. - That would be the effect of signing Kyoto in its present form. Until we have an agreement that embraces all of the major emitters, including the United States and China, we are never going to have an effective protocol. In the meantime all countries, including Australia, will take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am happy to compare Australia's performance in meeting her Kyoto target of 108 with the efforts of other countries that on occasions assume the right to lecture Australia about our contribution. My first responsibility is not to an ideology on this. It is to the jobs and future of Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and for his very strong support of small business. I can advise the member for Hasluck and all members of the House that Work Choices has really delivered strong growth in jobs - in fact, 175,800 jobs to be specific. As well, the flexibility of Work Choices has enabled small businesses to negotiate 24,000 AWAs with their employees. This is where 24,000 small business people have sat down with their employees and negotiated for their mutual benefit. -  - The opposition obviously does not want to listen, but many in industry are very determined and very supportive of Work Choices. Let me tell the House what Mr Bill Healey, the Director of the Australian Hotels Association, says:WorkChoices will mean that business operators will have greater incentive to move out of the current one-size-fits-all award system and negotiate arrangements that are better suited to their business, the local economy and needs of the worker.I am also asked by the member for Hasluck if small business is anxious about the prospect of having collective bargaining reimposed on them. They certainly are. Not only that, but there are 24,000 people currently employed in small business and the Leader of the Opposition will just take their AWAs and rip them up. As well as that, the 1.2 million small businesses know that the Leader of the Opposition plans to reintroduce unfair dismissal legislation onto 1.2 million small businesses, in stark contrast to what this government stands for with small business. It is no wonder, Mr Speaker, that the Leader of the Opposition proudly boasts -  - 'We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party.' And small business knows it.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the member for Grayndler for his question. There are three places I do not go for advice on climate change. One of them is to unsuccessful candidates for the US presidency who cannot even convince their own people that they are right. The second place is the movies - The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - The third place is the Labor Party, who promote a policy that will cost jobs in Australia. The inner-city Sydney attitudes of the member for Grayndler are in stark contrast to those of Mr Tony Maher, the General President of the CFMEU, who found himself compelled to write to the Leader of the Opposition complaining that the Labor Party was selling them out on jobs in the coal industry. His letter went on to say:My point is I fear -  - The Labor Party is asking us to ratify Kyoto and sacrifice Australian jobs, particularly jobs in the coal industry. Tony Maher said in his letter that 30,000 jobs were being put at risk by the member for Charlton in her opposition to what she described as a 'rapacious' coal industry.This government will continue to support the jobs of Australians. We will continue to support policies that actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions and technologies that will see greenhouse gas emissions lowered, not policies supported by the Labor Party on Kyoto that will simply cost jobs. I table documents to back the statement.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Indi for her question and appreciate very much the way in which she has been engaged in this process, because the radical changes to superannuation in this country are all about the Howard government securing and planning for the future of this country. We have an ageing population in this country and we must put in place proper retirement plans, proper economic plans, to secure this nation's future.The responses to the final announcements made in response to the consultation period that we had last week have been that the plan will be overwhelmingly successful. All of the industry advice to us has been that this is a great plan for the future of the country. Richard Gilbert, the CEO of IFSA, the Investment and Financial Services Association, welcomed the announcements. He said:The package will help make life simpler and more efficient for industry, with the benefits ultimately flowing through to consumers _Dr Michaela Anderson of ASFA, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, said:These are highly positive steps to reform super, and will increase workers' engagement with one of their most significant investments ...Out of all of this, one of the most significant plans that have ever been put forward by a government to secure the economic future of the nation, the most significant point that needs to be made is that there has still not been one utterance from the Leader of the Opposition on superannuation. There were 1,500 submissions made in relation to the government's plans to radically overhaul superannuation and not one suggestion was made by the Leader of the Opposition. I went to the index. You can look under 'A' for Australian Labor Party - no submission. You can look under 'B' for Beazley - no submission. You can skip down to 'K' for Kim - no submission under 'Kim' either.Last week the opposition leader had the perfect opportunity when he was addressing the International CEO Forum. He delivered a speech called 'Nation building for the modern economy'. He was talking about the future of this nation and there was not one word on superannuation. He never mentioned retirement policy. It is one of the biggest policies affecting the nation's future, and there was nothing mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition at all. It is an example to the Australian people of why the Leader of the Opposition is not fit to govern this country.</DOC>

 - It remains the policy of the government to privatise Medibank Private. Given that we are proceeding with T3 - the sale of approximately some $8 billion of stock in Telstra to the public - and given that it is the strong desire of the government to have a public float of Medibank Private, our financial advisers have suggested that, clearly, the two should not be run together. That stands to reason. I would have thought that even those on the opposition front bench who do not study these matters very closely would immediately acknowledge that to try to run the two of them together would be unwise, and we are plainly not going to do that. We do intend to go ahead with the legislation because it is the policy of the government to privatise Medibank Private.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to confirm to the House that, at the RSL National Congress in Western Australia, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be announcing an injection of an additional $600 million into veterans' health care services. The purpose of this injection of funds is to ensure that the full value of the gold card and the white card is maintained for the more than 300,000 Australian veterans and widows who currently enjoy the benefits of these particular cards.I remind the House that the gold card was introduced by the coalition government. It remains one of the major contributions made by any government over the last 20 years to the cause of veterans' health care. Bearing in mind that, of those entitled to the gold card, 70 per cent are over the age of 75 years and, as a result, they have regular resort to not only general practitioners but also medical specialists, pathologists, allied health officials and many others in the medical field, it is essential that the full value of the gold card is maintained.In recent months evidence has emerged that some doctors were not giving full credit to the gold card. Some were indicating an unwillingness to treat veterans under the gold card system. The government conducted a very detailed examination and formed the view that some enhancements of the amounts paid to specialists, pathologists, optometrists and other health professionals, and some increases in their fees, were needed and justified. We have conducted discussions with the Australian Medical Association, and the Australian Medical Association has responded enthusiastically to what the government has put forward and indicated that it believes it will not only reinforce the commitment of those doctors who continue to give full faith and credit to the gold card - and I thank them for doing so - but also bring back into the gold card system a large number of doctors who were either not treating under the gold card system or thinking of taking that course of action.We have discussed the matter with the leadership of the RSL. The RSL has expressed its very warm and positive response to these changes that have been made. Looking after those who put their lives on the line for this country is a basic responsibility of any government. What we have done by this announcement will add to the $4.6 billion annually which is committed to the support and care of Australian veterans. The gold card was a great decision and a great innovation. It recognised in a very emphatic way the debt we owe to these men and women. By the announcement being made by the minister in Perth today, we are reinforcing the enduring commitment of the coalition to the value of the gold card to those more than 300,000 Australians who richly deserve its benefits and its entitlements.</DOC>

 - As it happens, I am - courtesy of the West Australian. There is an article in the West Australian that reveals something the Leader of the Opposition would not reveal at the weekend - that Labor's policy on AWAs will allow unions to demand a review of an Australian workplace agreement even if the employee does not want this to occur. The West Australian, in an article authored by Kim Macdonald and Chris Johnson, had this to say:Under the policy, confirmed by Mr Beazley's office, unions would be allowed to call on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to subject all existing individual agreements to change to fit a new set of yet-to-be-announced minimum standards, even if neither party in the agreement want to change.This is the latest assault by the Labor Party on, potentially, up to one million working conditions of Australians. What the Labor Party are going to do - and the big signs show it - is tear up the working conditions of one million Australians. They are going to put a dagger to the throat of the great resource industries of Western Australia.It is no surprise that this story appeared in the West Australian - and it is no surprise because the people of Western Australia know the enormous contribution that the mining industry is making not only to the wealth of that state but also to the wealth of the entire nation. So bit by bit, answer by answer, article by article, we are having dragged out of the Leader of the Opposition the extent to which he has capitulated to the union movement on this issue.This is the latest example. The article confirms it, because David Robinson of the union movement in Western Australia made it very clear that what is going to be involved here is that, if you had a workplace agreement, there could be an approach made to the Industrial Relations Commission to have the workplace agreement reopened, and superimposed on that workplace agreement would be a new set of minimum standards - yet to be announced, of course; that will presumably come in some other answer to a question - notwithstanding the fact that neither the employer nor the employee want that agreement reopened.The collective bargaining proposals of the Leader of the Opposition are a wish fulfilment of Mr Greg Combet's desire to see the union movement once again running the affairs of this country. Mr Combet famously said in Adelaide: 'There used to be a time when the unions ran Australia. It wouldn't be a bad idea if we returned to those days.'There is a place for the union movement in this country, but it is not a place that involves its compulsory insertion in every employment contract irrespective of whether that union movement is wanted or not. Under the laws that have been put into place by this government, if people want a union to bargain on their behalf, they can do so. If people want to belong to a union, they can do so. If they do not want to belong to a union, then their rights to refuse to belong to a union are to be protected. But it will never be part of the industrial relations policy of this government to allow unwanted union intervention upsetting an arrangement concluded between an employer and an employee to the mutual benefit and advancement of those two parties.</DOC>

 - I am generally aware of that report. I am also specifically aware of a speech made by Mr Ric Battellino, the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia - a speech he made on 22 August 2006. He had this to say:... in judging the health of household finances, we should not look at trends in debt in isolation; we need to look at the overall financial position of households.If we do this, we see that households' financial assets have increased by substantially more than their debt ... As a result, even though household debt has increased, the net financial position of households has improved noticeably.In other words, Australians are much wealthier now than they were 10 years ago. They are much better off. You do not just look at the increase in debt; you look at the commensurate increase in assets. Anybody with a simple understanding of economics will know that. What Mr Battellino was saying was that, if you look at the overall situation, you find that the financial position of Australian households has, to use his words, 'improved noticeably' - and that, of course, has happened over the last 10 years under the stewardship of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question. One of the classic examples of a company that has benefited from the free trade agreement with the United States comes from his electorate - the Murray Goulburn dairy manufacturer in Leongatha, which just happens to employ 400 people in Leongatha. As a result of the negotiations, we got much better access - fairer access - for dairy products. From Leongatha, Murray Goulburn is exporting butter, cheese and skim milk powder into the United States market. It is one of the dramatic increases in access that has been gained by the Australian dairy industry as a result of the free trade agreement.The United States is the largest economy in the world. It is more than five times the size of the economy of China. The free trade agreement is bringing real benefits to our exporters and helping to create many new jobs in the Australian economy. The United States is our second largest trading partner, now worth over $41 billion each year.The break-up across the different sectors of what we are selling to the United States is interesting. The member for McMillan will be interested in this. Twenty-two per cent is agricultural goods, 32 per cent is services and 46 per cent is non-agricultural goods - that is, manufactured goods, processed foods and the like. The United States market is currently our second largest beef market. We have been exporting record levels of lamb products and dairy products to the United States.The manufacturing exporters are also doing extremely well in this market as a result of the FTA. In 2005-06, there was an increase of six per cent - up to about $4.6 billion worth of exports. This included medical instruments, auto exports, telecommunications and medications.The other point I want to make is that the value-added processed food exports into the United States are also going very well. I want to instance one other Victorian company which is about to break back into the market in the United States. It is the famous Four'N Twenty pies icon from Bairnsdale in Victoria - probably from the electorate of the member for Gippsland. It has just announced that it is going to export the great Aussie pie back into the US market.The managing director of that company said that the free trade agreement played a big part in getting into the US market. But, most importantly, this brand was owned by an American company. It has been bought back by an Australian company and now that company is going to be exporting into the American market. That says something for the strength of the Australian economy - that this business is able to be competitive, operate on the international stage and export back into the United States market.</DOC>

 - I am broadly aware of those figures. As I indicated in response to a similar question asked yesterday, I would want to know, in relation to the debate on housing affordability, what proportion of those represented the repossessions of houses under mortgage defaults, because you can have a mortgage on a commercial property just as easily as you can have a mortgage on a housing property. -  - I will be interested to know whether it is the policy of the Australian Labor Party, if it wins office, to abolish any business bankruptcies. The reality is that from time to time firms do get into difficulty; it is also the case that, sadly, from time to time, individual households do. I take the opportunity of counselling people against taking on obligations beyond their capacity to repay.But the truth is overwhelmingly that the problem of housing affordability is not a problem of interest rates; it is a problem related to the disproportionately large increase in the price of housing over recent years. We all know that. The Governor of the Reserve Bank knows that and any sensible analysis will tell you that. People are borrowing more because interest rates are low. When interest rates go high, people will borrow less. It is axiomatic that if interest rates are low people will borrow more and take on greater obligation; that is happening and, as a consequence, some of them, sadly, will get into difficulties.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and for his interest, because I know he has a serious interest in these issues and he shares the view that all members of the government share that obviously the issue of climate change is one of the issues the international community needs to address. This government believes that issues should be addressed not by left-wing ranting but in a sensible and practical way. One of the things that really amuse me about the political Left in this country is that they seem to think they have a solution to the issue of climate change. Their argument is that, if you sign the Kyoto protocol and ratify it, somehow that will solve the problem of climate change. If I may say so, this is a deceit. It is deceiving the Australian people to argue that if Australia signed the Kyoto protocol somehow that would solve the problem of climate change. It is quite wrong.The government have not ratified Kyoto, not because we do not think the issue of climate change needs to be addressed, but for two reasons. First of all, Kyoto will not have any significant impact at all on the issue of climate change. It is estimated that if the 2010 targets are met by all those countries that have set targets - and I think it is highly unlikely that those targets will be reached - global emissions will be 40 per cent higher than they were in 1990. If there were no Kyoto protocol, those emissions would be 41 per cent higher than they were in 1990. You cannot argue that that is going to have a significant impact on climate change - or, to put that another way, if these targets are met, by the year 2100 global temperatures will be cut by just 3/100ths of a degree -  - What is particularly significant is that Kyoto does nothing to address the issue of emissions from developing countries like China, Brazil and India. The second objection we have to Kyoto is that it puts all the burden on countries like Australia and none of the burden on the developing world, which means in the end that you are proposing to export jobs from our own country to the developing world - to China and Indonesia. - The government believes that the great challenge for the world is to do two things. One is to address the issue of climate change, and the other is to do so in a way that does not destroy jobs and does not destroy the ambitions of developing countries to achieve higher living standards. That is why the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, AP6, is such a sensible proposal.That great intellectual giant, the Leader of the Opposition, says that the officials cannot persuade anybody in the States to support it. The Americans will be participating in the working groups along with the Chinese, the Indians, the Koreans, the Japanese and, of course, the Australians. We will be participating in working groups in South Korea during the course of next month, when we will consider 90 different projects dealing with the question of transfers of technology to developing countries, the introduction of new technologies and issues such as cleaner fossil fuels and support for renewable energy. This is a practical way of addressing an important issue without destroying jobs and without undermining the capacity of developing countries to improve living standards.Kyoto does nothing to address this issue. The Labor Party is trying to convince the Australian public it cares about climate change, so it says it would ratify Kyoto. But the fact is, as I have explained, it will not address climate change and, as we know from statements the member for Grayndler has made, Labor has not supported the AP6 initiative.</DOC>

 - The answer to the question is: no, I have not seen the movie. I will possibly, at some stage, see the movie. But on the subject of seeing movies -  - I have heard a lot of what Mr Gore has said. It has been hard to escape Mr Gore on the ABC over the last 24 hours. He has appeared on just about every conceivable program, but I will just make that factual statement. I heard him - I think it was on Radio National - this morning. It is interesting -  - that he was asked about seeing movies. He was asked whether he had seen the Path to 9/11, and he said, 'No, I haven't seen it.' It is interesting, of course, because the Path to 9/11 was mildly critical, in various stages, of the policies of the administration that Mr Gore once belonged to. He was at pains to make the point that these movies are not always factual and they have an obligation to be factual. I think that is right. - Mr Gore and I actually had quite a pleasant but short telephone conversation yesterday, which he initiated. I think it is fair to say -  - that, in relation to this issue -  -  - The argument in relation to this issue is not an argument about whether or not - The member for Hunter then left the chamber. - The argument over climate change is not whether there is a threat posed by climate change; there seems to be broad agreement on that, although there is a lot of legitimate debate about the speed of that change and the nature of the threat, and I do not think it is right to say that there is total unanimity about that in the scientific community. But that is one part of the debate. The other part of the debate is how best to respond to it. I have made it very plain on behalf of the government that we do not intend to sign a protocol which would export Australian jobs to other countries. Those from the other side who interject so vociferously do not include the quiet, contemplative member for Batman, whose views on this subject are a little closer to reality than the man who sits immediately on his left - that is, the spokesman on this area. This is what the member for Batman correctly had to say on this issue -  - He said in the Australian of 13 January 2006:It's time to abandon the political correctness espoused by the green movement. Let's be real: without getting business on board we cannot achieve anything._            _            _... the Asia-Pacific Partnership ... offers Australia not only an opportunity for economic growth, but also allows us to be part of the solution to the environmental consequences of what is happening in our region ...They are the sorts of arguments -  - that I would play back to the former Vice President of the United States. They are the arguments that I would use in response to the shadow minister. They are the arguments of one of the few people on the front bench of the Australian Labor Party who has an interest in preserving Australian jobs. He wants Australian jobs; the rest of them want them to go to China or Indonesia, but we agree with the member for Batman.</DOC>

 - I can assure the member for Mitchell that Labor's scaremongering is wrong; it is dead wrong. Privatisation will be as good for Medibank Private as it has been -  - for Qantas and as it has been for the Commonwealth Bank. That is why this sale has been deferred but certainly not abandoned - because privatisation of Medibank Private will be good for policyholders, it will be good for taxpayers and it will be good for the health sector as a whole. Let me quote the chief executive of NIB, a gentleman called Mark Fitzgibbon, who said:The pressure on premiums will be reduced if Medibank goes private. We expect much more aggressive competition from a privately owned Medibank.Then, of course, there was Francis Sullivan, the chief executive of Catholic Health Australia, who said:... Medibank Private has outgrown its government parentage._            _            _What is needed is to open the market to new players who bring serious competitive tension and innovation to the health system.There was even a time when the Leader of the Opposition himself supported privatisation. In 1995, in this chamber, the Leader of the Opposition said:We as a government have a considerable rate of success in relation to privatisation. We have two airlines undergoing privatisation._            _            _... We are getting the airports in place. We have privatised ... the Commonwealth Bank. We have privatised the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the bulk of defence industries.He went on to say:The total number of privatisation projects under the Fraser-Howard government amounted to Belconnen Mall ...He even mocked the coalition for being insufficiently in favour of privatisation. How times have changed, and how the Leader of the Opposition has so totally shrunk in stature since those days. Let us make it absolutely clear: privatisation of Medibank Private will no more raise health insurance premiums than the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank raised interest rates and the privatisation of Qantas caused airfares to rise.There are two conclusions to be drawn from the Labor Party's cheap populism on this point. The first is that they are still socialists at heart. They absolutely hate the private sector. The second is that the Leader of the Opposition is a much less principled politician now -  - than he was when he had real leaders like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating to tell him what was right.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As was announced on Sunday, 10 September, meetings will be held with fruit and vegetable growers and wholesale representatives to develop an enforceable code of conduct for the industry. The key aim is to develop a code, enforceable by law, that will provide growers with a transparency of contracts that many currently do not have. The government is determined to have a code that includes minimum terms of trade that are transparent and enforceable in law. Growers have the right to know whether the wholesaler is acting as an agent or a merchant prior to the sale. Other aspects being worked on as part of this process include an effective dispute resolution mechanism and the provision of clear market signals on price.Growers, as well as those in the whole supply chain, including wholesalers and fresh markets, know who is acting in their best interests. They know who are the friends of producers as well as small business - the coalition parties, not the Labor Party.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. Indeed, I am aware of proposals by the Leader of the Opposition to introduce compulsory union bargaining in Australia. These plans, which are being pushed by the Leader of the Opposition and the union movement, both here in Australia and internationally, are basically a threat to the Australian economy.The employers of Australia, who have created over 175,000 jobs in the last five months in Australia, are now staring down the barrel of a handover of control of their businesses to militant unions because of this proposal by the Leader of the Opposition. The reaction today in Western Australia, the home state of the Leader of the Opposition and member for Brand, could not be clearer. The Australian Industry Group said that this was one of the most extreme industrial steps ever taken by the Labor Party. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that some Western Australian businesses - members from Western Australia should particularly note this - would struggle to survive under these proposals. This was all summed up in an editorial in the West Australian today headed 'Beazley's IR plan to hand back control to the unions'. The editorial writer said, inter alia:It is evident from Mr Beazley's pronouncements that he intends to hand back control of IR to the unions - a huge leap back into an inglorious past of union agitated industrial disputation.That is the summary of the West Australian and other business groups in that state of the consequence of this decision by the Leader of the Opposition to introduce compulsory union bargaining if he was elected to government.This attack on the Australian economy is not just being carried out here in Australia; it is being carried out overseas as well. Indeed, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sharan Burrow, has been using an international forum, the International Labour Organisation, to talk down the government's reforms, business leaders and -  -  - They interject, Mr Speaker -  - but do they agree with Ms Burrow going to the ILO and talking down the Australian economy? That is precisely what she has been doing. - Not only was Sharan Burrow caught out breaching the ILO protocols in this attack. In her address to the International Labour Organisation she attacked Australian business leaders, saying that the government was 'in the grip of the greediest business leaders'. That is what she said about people who have created 175,000 jobs here in Australia and taken the unemployment rate in this country to 4.9 per cent. Not only was she attacking business leaders in Australia in an international forum, badmouthing this country overseas; she also attacked the International Monetary Fund, the IMF -  - because it dared to support the labour market reforms in this country. She said of the IMF, because it supported what this government has done to create jobs and drive up wages in Australia, that it was morally bankrupt and economically short-sighted - again, talking down Australia and talking down the Australian economy overseas. These are attacks on the economy in this country.You would be forgiven for thinking that Sharan Burrow thought that you know who, the Leader of the Opposition, was still the minister for employment in Australia. She must be thinking about the days when we had unemployment rates under the Labor Party still over 10 per cent. She must be thinking back to the days under the Leader of the Opposition as the minister for employment when real wages actually went backwards in Australia. One would be forgiven for thinking that Sharan Burrow was still living in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when this man here was responsible for destroying employment in Australia. Can I say this: it is one thing to have a reasoned debate here in Australia about these matters, but when people like Sharan Burrow go overseas and talk down Australia and the Australian economy that is simply a disgrace.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. I can confirm that the Australian government will be sending a special envoy in the form of the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, David Ritchie, to the Solomon Islands. He is going today, and tomorrow he will be meeting with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Mr Sogovare, and others. This will be an opportunity for Mr Ritchie to register serious concerns with the Solomon Islands government about its plans for a commission of inquiry into the April 2006 civil unrest in Honiara.Australia is concerned about the intentions behind this commission of inquiry. We believe that it will prejudice the outcome of court cases against two imprisoned members of parliament facing riot related allegations and it will endeavour to cast blame for the riots on the police response - which, by the way, included the Australian police - not on the people who were responsible for those riots taking place and, of course, those who funded those people. This would be completely at odds with the support for the rule of law and the genuine desire to work with RAMSI to improve security in the Solomon Islands, which the Solomon Islands government has said that it supports.We are also very concerned about recent attacks on the judiciary in the Solomon Islands. The integrity of the judiciary is vital for the stability and prosperity of the Solomon Islands, including in the fight against corruption. There is no denying that corruption has been a major problem in the Solomon Islands over a long period of time, and RAMSI has been helping the Solomon Islands with this since July 2003. Australia and New Zealand as well as other countries in the region have extended considerable resources to support the Solomon Islands in combating corruption and to re-establish economic growth. We expect to see a renewed effort by the Solomon Islands government to fight corruption, rather than establishing procedures which will undermine the judiciary and undermine the work that is being done by the police. I also note that millions of dollars are expected to be spent on this commission of inquiry, and I am not sure where that money, in the end, is going to come from. But that money would be much better spent on the development of the Solomon Islands and on assistance to the people of the Solomon Islands.We are in close consultation with other countries, especially the other partners in RAMSI, in relation to this commission of inquiry. Regional partners do not want a negative, uncooperative approach to the Solomon Islands, but we do need to see a Solomon Islands government willing to work cooperatively with regional partners.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and I note her concern about this issue. Parents have a right to receive information about how their child is performing at school and they should not be kept in the dark about their child's progress. Unfortunately, too many school reports were using jargon and language that parents just could not understand. Phrases such as 'working towards achievement' or 'preliminary achievement' gave parents no sense of how their child was progressing. In response to parents' concerns, the Howard government made it a condition of the schools funding agreement that parents would receive report cards that were in plain English and that they would be graded from A to E or an equivalent.Every state and territory government signed up to this funding agreement and promised to deliver to parents plain English report cards. All states and territories have reported that they are tracking well in implementing these report cards except for New South Wales. I can appreciate why the member for Lindsay asked this question. Suddenly the New South Wales government is wavering in its commitment. This is because it is coming under inordinate pressure from the New South Wales Teachers Federation. The New South Wales Teachers Federation wants the New South Wales government to drop its commitment to plain English report cards. You would have to ask why the Teachers Federation would want parents to be denied information about their child's progress. The answer lies in a public statement from the New South Wales Teachers Federation, where it was said that the new reporting system 'has the potential to set up a system of ranking schools and then subsequently teachers'. The Teachers Federation is terrified that its members will have to be accountable for their performance. That is why it is demanding that the New South Wales government drop report cards in plain English for parents. They are putting their own interests before the interests of parents and students. I call upon the New South Wales government to meet its commitment to deliver on its promise for plain English report cards and to join with the Howard government in ensuring that parents have the information that they need to know about their child's progress at school.</DOC>

I might add that the member for Griffith is referring to an email, a document, that has been released by the Cole inquiry. Can I point out that, of the 66 countries and the 2,000 companies involved in the oil for food program, I think Australia is the only country that has established this inquiry, the Cole inquiry, that has now sat for 65 days -  - with over 70 witnesses, thousands of pages of evidence -  - including that which has been used by the member for Griffith today. This government has done everything it can to ensure that a fair and open inquiry is undertaken. We look forward to the results of the Cole inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his genuine interest in this disturbing area. Unfortunately, since the allegations and the statements by Nanette Rogers from the Northern Territory DPP earlier in the year, there has been a steady flow of commentary both in the press and in direct correspondence to my department about very serious allegations of both sexual and violent crimes against women and children, in particular boys, in many remote communities. These are things that I am sure disturb all of us in this House.I want to bring the House up to date with some of the steps that have been undertaken by the federal government subsequent to our summit into the violence and sexual abuse, where the federal government committed $130 million to try and address some of these serious issues with the provision of additional police, through bilaterals with states and territories and by instigating a national intelligence desk which will be operating from Alice Springs early next month. That will build on the success of the Central Australia intelligence desk dealing with interdiction of illegal substances, which has been very successful and again has been a commitment from the Howard government to those communities.I was in Alice Springs last Saturday and I announced that the dog sniffer team that we had committed back in May had been accepted by the Territory government. I commend the Territory government for adding additional dog teams to this one so that there will be two stationed in Alice Springs, and through the APY lands in South Australia and through the central desert areas we can take further steps in removing individuals who are supplying illicit substances to these communities. There is much more to be done. The bilaterals are coming along. South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales have signed up. We will be having further negotiations with the Territory, Queensland and the other states early next month.Going back to the original question from the member for Solomon, he asked about whether I am aware of any further allegations. I am also aware of the allegation of the rape of a 12-year-old boy in Maningrida in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. This was reported to some small extent, considering this is alleged to have occurred over a three-month period. A 12-year-old male was raped by five juveniles and five adults from that community. It raised with me the concern I have as to why this had not been more widely reported, as I am sure it would have been in almost any other part of the country. One of the conclusions I have come to is that unfortunately with Maningrida, like so many other remote Indigenous communities, people still require permits to go there. They need to seek the permission of a select group in order to be able to go directly to these communities. I know from personal experience that on occasions when the media has wanted to accompany - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - I think the member for Swan, as he makes his way out of the chamber, would like to know that what I am referring to here has been on ABC and has been in the Australian. Unlike so many in this House, he too has probably been unaware of this alleged heinous crime. - I believe that the time has come for us and the federal government to look at the legislation that we need to remove in the territories and some states where we require people to get a permit in order to be able to go to these communities. We cannot allow -  - We can no longer allow the situation to occur where children are being abused, where these various serious crimes are being perpetrated on people and where the full glare of Australia's public through its media cannot be brought to bear so that Australians demand that this no longer occur. The federal government has spoken with $130 million worth of commitments. We are working with the states and territories but it is time that the permit system be removed. I know the member for Solomon believes this. He called for it in July. I support his call for it -  - and I hope that the states and territories will also support this call.The member for Lingiari then left the chamber. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. He is most concerned, of course, about all of his constituents, particularly those of a mature age who are seeking work. We believe that everyone of working age in Australia has the right to work. We know that they may have different capacities. Some may seek part-time work. We will support them into a job.I have to say, with mature age people - over 50 - there is often a little more difficulty when they line up for a job interview. It is harder for some mature age job seekers to get their foot in the door. Their application may be dismissed because they are older and there is not a great expectation that they will be up to the work. In fact, we know that a mature age person often has life skills and interpersonal skills that make them absolutely highly productive and very important people in a workplace, especially as our population ages. We have a number of job vacancies now which very well suit mature age persons, whether the job is in retail, in manufacturing, in hospitality or tourism or in any of our services which cater for people of a similar age.Let me say to you that we have about 130,000 people over 50 at the moment who are seeking employment. We have chosen to focus very much on assisting such job seekers, and so last year alone 73,000 mature age Australians were supported into work. They were supported through our Job Network, which has been specially tasked with this very important work. They have, for example, made sure they help people build up their resumes and job interview skills. They offer, through the Australian government, short-term wage subsidies. They can also help with work experience for someone who has perhaps been out of the workforce for a very long time. We can offer them work experience, for example, through Work for the Dole, and such work experience there is very much related to local workplace and workforce shortages.We respect the needs of all Australians seeking work, as I say, and we have been most successful in our job placements, but it was not always the case. I want to tell you about 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was in fact the minister for employment. He said mature age people were 'condemned to a second-class life'. These were the unemployed under Labor in 1993. What was his solution? He was supported in government by the member for Lilley saying: 'We've got a good idea. We'll just pass these long-term or mature age unemployed straight onto the old age pension at age 55.' That was the Leader of the Opposition's solution when he was minister for employment - place 55-year-olds on the old age pension. Fortunately, his own side, in particular the member for Petrie at the time, described that idea as 'stupid' and 'totally irresponsible', so it did not go forward. But let me say to you that we do not treat mature age Australians looking for work as second class and we do not condemn them to a second-class life; we have a very comprehensive mature age job seeker program, and it has been hugely successful.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for that very important question. Can I start my answer by updating him on the state of the labour market in Corangamite. In March of 1996 the unemployment rate in Corangamite was 8.6 per cent. It is now 4.7 per cent. I know the work of the member over that 10-year period has played a major role in that fall.I can say generally in reply to the member that yesterday the quarterly Manpower survey of employment intentions was released and it showed the biggest increase in intention to employ since the survey began. Last week the Westpac-ACCI survey of industrial trends reported the strongest increase since December 2004 on employment growth. These two reports are consistent with the ABS statistics, which show unemployment at the lowest levels since the 1970s, the participation rate rising to a record high and over 175,000 new jobs created since Work Choices began, with 85 per cent of those new jobs being full-time jobs.We all remember the predictions made by the Labor Party and the unions. We all remember they said there would be mass sackings. There have not; there have been mass hirings. They said that there would be an increase in industrial disputes; they are now at a record low. They said wages would be cut; wages continue to rise in real terms. On every score, the predictions made by the Labor Party and the union movement about Work Choices have been demonstrated to be wrong. Work Choices has not brought about the Armageddon that was predicted by the Australian Labor Party.But it is worse than that. I am asked about alternative policies. They have some alternative policies. The alternative policies would bring back the job-destroying unfair dismissal laws. The alternative policies would wrench the secondary boycott protections out of the Trade Practices Act and return them to the Industrial Relations Commission, where they would be a completely useless sanction. On top of that, the Labor Party would embrace a form of so-called collective bargaining which would give an open permit to the unions of this country to enter any workplace they wanted to, and, if more than 50 per cent of the workers in that workplace voted for a collective agreement, they would deny the freedom of choice of the remaining 49 per cent and the employer to have individual contracts.That is the sort of policy that would take us back to the bad old days when we had one million Australians out of work. We do not want to go back; we want to go forward. The prosperity of today is the product of the reforms of yesterday, and tomorrow's prosperity can only be purchased with today's reform. The Labor Party stand against reform. They stand in favour of taking the Australian economy back to the years when more than one million Australians were out of work.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me that question. I actually had a meeting with the leadership of the Australian Federal Police Association only a few weeks ago, and I can assure you of this, Mr Speaker: they were not complaining about our industrial relations policy. They were raising other matters -  - I am very proud of the Australian Federal Police, and I am very proud of the additional financial support. It is very interesting; what the Leader of the Opposition has done is draw attention to the difference between our policy and his. Under our policy you can choose; under his policy you cannot. What he would do is deny -  -  - Under our policy you have many choices. Under the Labor policy, what comes out at the end of the process is what will be dictated by the ACTU, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it.

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I am delighted to inform him that these changes are benefiting the people of Barker, because in the June quarter the unemployment rate in Barker fell to 4.1 per cent. Indeed, I can advise the member for Barker and other honourable members that in March 1996 over 45 federal electorates in Australia had unemployment rates above 10 per cent. Almost one-third of the federal electorates in Australia in March 1996 had an unemployment rate above 10 per cent. The data for the electorates today show that there is no electorate in Australia today that has an unemployment rate above 10 per cent, and that is an example of the good reforms that have been put in place.The electorate of Barker and all the other electorates around Australia are therefore benefiting from the strong economic management of this government. I am asked by the member for Barker about proposals to re-regulate, and every policy position that the ACTU imposes on this compliant Leader of the Opposition here is designed to do two things. They are designed, firstly, to restrict the ability of employers and employees to agree about the working arrangements that best suit their particular needs and conditions. And, secondly, they are designed to increase the unfettered powers of unions in Australian workplaces, even as union density in Australia continues to fall.So we had the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, down at the Press Club this afternoon in what was generally a left-wing rant. He actually -  -  - A socialist rant. I am being kind. But amongst this left-wing rant - amongst phrases disguised to hide true intentions, like 'good faith bargaining' and 'workplace democracy' - what we know is that the Leader of the Opposition has been ordered by his union bosses to adopt union monopoly bargaining; a good faith bargaining which is really compulsory union bargaining.People of Australia should understand what this actually means. When the rhetoric is stripped away, what this actually means is that unions will have an unqualified right to involve themselves in any workplace in Australia which they choose, regardless of whether or not that particular workplace has a union member. That is the purport of what was discussed by Mr Combet. In fact, employers will be forced by Labor to negotiate with the union regardless of whether or not the employees actually consent to this. Mr Combet made this absolutely clear today. He was asked a question by a journalist from the Financial Review about this particular article. What he did first of all was correct what Mr Beazley said on Friday and said, 'No, that wasn't actually what the Labor Party policy was.' Then he stressed - and this is important - that you do not need a majority of employees to demand collective bargaining; that the union will simply be able to march in and demand union bargaining.Secondly, he rejected the US model, which actually means you must have a majority. Further, in black-and-white terms, on page 18 in the document which the ACTU released today, it says:A lack of majority employee support would not of itself be grounds for the Commission to refrain from making any good faith bargaining orders.So what this means, and let us make no bones about this, is that whether or not you have got a union member in a workplace, and whether or not that union is otherwise represented in that workplace - as Mr Combet has pointed out in correcting the Leader of the Opposition, who last week did not even know the detail of the policy that has been forced upon him - the unions can walk into that place and demand compulsory collective bargaining. That is what their policy is about, and Mr Combet let the beans out today in relation to that.We have seen over the last 10 years, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years. We have representatives of the tourism industry in Australia here today. They know from their experience that the reforms of the last 10 years have led to greater employment and greater business prosperity in this country. They are because of those reforms. And yet this weak Leader of the Opposition would rip up not only the most recent reforms; he would rip up the previous reforms and take us back where Mr Combet and the union movement want us, to the 1970s and the 1980s - to the days when the Leader of the Opposition presided over an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent and industrial disputation was 30 times what it is today. That would be economic vandalism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. Australia's exports continue to grow, with figures released on Friday last week showing that exports for July were a record for that month and the second highest monthly level ever at $17.5 billion. Exports for the last financial year rose by 17 per cent to reach a new high level of $192 billion worth of goods and services exported out of Australia. That has risen from $99 billion in 1995-96 when the Labor Party was last in office. Last year $192 billion worth of goods and services were exported out of Australia.All of those industries and businesses that are exporting around the world have made a contribution to the generation of new jobs in the Australian economy that has helped drive unemployment down to 4.9 per cent. It has lifted the participation rate to the record level it is at today. In recent months, since the introduction of Work Choices, we have seen 175,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy. So those industries are making their contribution and playing their part as well.The government, over the years, has made a number of significant reforms to strengthen and underpin the competitive nature of Australia's export industries. One of the most important reforms that we did undertake to ensure the competitiveness of Australian exports was on the waterfront. We all remember the debate and the battle that we had to try and improve the efficiency of the waterfront. Today, in 2006, crane lift rates have hit 27 movements per hour.In 1996, there were 14 crane movements per hour and we were being told by the Labor Party and the union movement that that could not be improved upon. They said: 'There is no way that it could be any better. You will never improve on it. That is world's best practice.' And today there are 27 movements per hour. The Leader of the Opposition is now committed to tearing up AWAs if he is re-elected. He is committed to going back and reintroducing collective bargaining in the workplace, so you have to ask yourself the question: is he going to roll back the reforms on the waterfront?The Leader of the Opposition wants to force collective bargaining back into the workplace. Today, at the National Press Club, ACTU Secretary Greg Combet has let the cat out of the bag. He said that Labor policy is now being driven again by the ACTU. That is a plain, simple fact. It is being driven by the ACTU and all Australians should recognise that. Yesterday Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group said about the policies of the Leader of the Opposition that Labor's collective bargaining plan is a retrograde step for the Australian economy in terms of what has taken place in recent years. So, while the coalition government is continuing to improve the circumstances in the Australian economy for business, for jobs and for employment prospects for the future, the Labor Party wants to take it back into the past. We want to support job creators in this economy. The Labor Party wants to destroy them.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question is no. The other observation I would make is that the capacity of an employer to have a view and to implement that view in relation to the nature of an employment contract with an individual or group of his employees prior to the introduction of Work Choices involved a capacity to decide not to have a collective agreement. Work Choices has not changed that fact. So whatever may be happening there in relation to whether there is an AWA or a collective agreement is not the result of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and his interest in this. His question about international experiences reminds me that in 1997 - in fact, on 9 September 1997 - the then new Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, made a famous address to the Trade Union Congress in that country in which he said, amongst other things:You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job ...Very prophetic words from the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain. Of course, this must be put in the context that at that stage it was predicted that, when Mr Blair first went to address the Trade Union Congress as the Prime Minister of the UK, he would go along and promise to rip up the industrial relations changes that had been put in place by the Thatcher government previously. Mr Blair had the ticker to stand up to the union leaders, who wanted to rip up the changes which had been put in place - something that ought to be a lesson for the Leader of the Opposition here in Australia. Indeed, if one looks at the experience in the UK since then, those changes, which Mr Blair was prepared to support in the face of opposition from the union movement, have led to more jobs and a lower unemployment rate in that country - indeed, a lower unemployment rate than exists in this country today. If one goes the 22 miles or so across the English Channel there is a totally different picture when one looks at what has happened in France and Germany, where there has been a failure of political will to make reforms in this area.Last night Tony Blair gave what is expected to be his last address to the Trade Union Congress in the UK. During that address Mr Blair spoke about the strong labour market, which has continued in the UK as a result of those workplace reforms which, when he became Prime Minister, he refused to rip up in the face of calls from the union movement to do so. Indeed, I note in the press reports of Mr Blair's speech to the Trade Union Congress overnight that he was heckled by some from the union movement. Several unionists walked out once again. The notable thing is that once again Tony Blair stood firm.There is a lesson to be learnt in this about the sort of courage and fortitude that one should have in this regard, because strong leaders who are interested in delivering economic prosperity for their country do not cower and take their orders from the union movement like this man over here. What we have seen in the last few months is a capitulation by the Leader of the Opposition to Greg Combet and the union movement. The Deputy Prime Minister noted today that Greg Combet in effect said, 'We are running the Labor Party again.' Too right they are, because what they want to do is rip up the very mechanisms -  - the very industrial relations reforms which have brought the prosperity which this country has today and which will best meet the challenges that this country faces in the future. We do not need weakness from this man here - this weak, capitulating man; what we need is people who will stand up and meet the challenges that Australia has got and continue the prosperity of this country.</DOC>

Let me read from the report of the insolvency practitioner what the member for Perth failed to disclose to this House - and it is becoming a pattern. - In relation to these matters, this is what the insolvency practitioner in his report said, amongst other things which you have failed to disclose:Our inquiries as to the nature of the loan accounts continue and we will report to creditors further if warranted.He then goes on and says further in the report, which has not been disclosed by the member for Perth:_ notwithstanding that a liquidator would need to carry out further investigations based on the oral evidence from the director and management, prima facie it appears that the company and PD Mulligan entered into these transactions in good faith.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Hughes for her question. As the member for Hughes knows, the best way to help create jobs is by having a strong economy. That is the first step. A second way to do it is to have structural reform, such as tax reform, but none more important than industrial relations workplace changes. The workplace changes that have been in place for 171 days have delivered more than 1,000 jobs a day since they were introduced by this government. The question is: how do we find the workers in Australia to go into those jobs? You might say, with 10.3 million Australians now in work - the highest number of Australians in work on record - and a participation rate of 65.1 per cent, the highest on record, that Australia is running out of workers. Well, we are about not only helping to create jobs but encouraging Australians to take up those jobs.We are doing it in a number of ways. I am reminded that we had a seminar down in Wollongong in the seat of Cunningham, and that seminar was attended by Angry Anderson, whom some people in this place would be familiar with. Angry said: 'The reason I hooked up with Centrelink is that they are making a concerted effort to show that they do more than just give people benefits.' He went on to say that employment provided workers with self-respect and a sense of achievement. Hear, hear to that. He referred to that famous VB ad that many people might be familiar with, even if they do not drink VB. He said: 'What the bloke in that ad was talking about was the rewards that come with a day's work. It is an ethic that is so Australian. Work is about earning your place. It is so much more than just a pay packet.' We agree.The most fundamental thing we can do to help Australian families is to provide them with the opportunity to have work. That is the first thing that we can do to provide a better welfare system to Australians and that is the best thing we can do to improve harmony in the community. We have done that in two ways in particular. The first was that in November 2004 we started ringing up people who had no obligation to work and who were on welfare. We rang them and asked them if they wanted to work. We left out the Labor frontbench! Just by our asking them if they wanted to work, 200,000 Australians have been referred to the Job Network. The second program is a fundamental program. From 1 July this year, we started Welfare to Work, a program that the Labor Party opposed all the way. Since that time we have referred 100,000 Australians to the Job Network. Everything we do about creating jobs in Australia is opposed by the Labor Party, whether it be industrial relations reform, tax reform, trying to reform the Australian economy to create jobs or encouraging Australians into work through programs such as Welfare to Work. The weak Leader of the Opposition opposes everything, because he is totally beholden to his mates in the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question. I will check part of it out with former Vice President Al Gore, who seems to have become a sort of resident authority for the opposition on just about everything. I am quite sure he, like all of our American friends, will take that with very great good humour -  - because that is the nature of the nation and that is the nature of the American people. This nation has every reason to be very proud of our friendship with the people of the United States, although on a lot of issues we approach things rather differently. That applies in relation to the social welfare system of this country, where this nation has struck the right balance between the overpaternalistic social welfare structure of Europe and some of the less desirable laissez-faire features of the social welfare structure of the United States. When it comes to the social security safety net, the Australian way is the best way.In relation to the particular question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, let me remind the House that HECS was introduced by the Labor Party when it was in government. We supported it, once again illustrating that when Labor brought in something that was good when it was in government we supported it, unlike the approach taken by the Labor Party in opposition. In relation to the OECD examination, I do not accept the conclusion drawn by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that in real terms Australia's public expenditure on educational institutions increased by 32 per cent between 1995 and 2003 -  - which is an increase greater than that in at least 12 other OECD countries. According to the OECD, Australia's expenditure on tertiary educational institutions has increased by 25 per cent in real terms between 1995 and 2003. - This magnitude of increase is higher than that in at least six other OECD countries, including Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Australia's total expenditure per student on tertiary education in 2003 is 10 per cent higher than the OECD average of $US11,254.The actual contribution of the Australian government to higher education is much higher than that indicated by the OECD. For example, the OECD fails to take into account the value of the 25 per cent discount paid for the student by the Australian government when that student pays their HECS fees up front. The OECD also fails to take into account the provision of HECS doubtful debts, such as the value of HECS paid by the Australian government for any student who never reaches the repayment threshold.I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and those interested in this issue that about 97 per cent of all domestic undergraduate students are in Commonwealth supported places. On average, about three-quarters of the cost of these students' education is met by the Australian government. The average HELP debt is around $10,500 for Australian students and most debts are quickly repaid.It stands to reason that the debt would have risen, because since 1996 the number of university students has nearly doubled. In 2005, university student numbers reached a record high of nearly one million. We are further expanding the number of new places by 39,000 and extending loans to private higher education providers. I reject the conclusion of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and the interest that she shows in this issue. I can confirm that the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands has written to the Prime Minister to advise that he wants Patrick Cole, who is our High Commissioner in Honiara, to be declared persona non grata - that is, to expel him from the Solomon Islands. Quite frankly, this decision by the Solomon Islands government is both eccentric and outrageous. The Australian government fully supports Patrick Cole and the work that he has done. He has been an excellent High Commissioner. He is an Australian public servant of long standing who has worked for both sides of politics as a public servant in a number of government departments - in particular, my department and the Prime Minister's department.In his discussion with our Prime Minister, the Solomon Islands Prime Minister said that Mr Cole had apparently been talking too much to the opposition in the Solomon Islands. It is the practice of our ambassadors and high commissioners around the world to keep in contact with opposition politicians and parties. In fact, it would be a long time since an Australian ambassador or a high commissioner was barred from talking to the opposition. That sort of thing happened in the days of the old Soviet Union, but it is pretty unusual these days. In this country, the ambassadors and high commissioners frequently talk with our opposition. This is just normal practice, even if they do not think that they are going to get much out of the conversation - which they do not, I believe. - No, I cannot resist having a crack at you socialists. - You are all the same, you lefties. The second allegation made against Patrick Cole is that the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands objected to Patrick Cole's opposition to the establishment of a commission of inquiry and in particular to some aspects of that commission of inquiry -  - and he quite rightly opposed that on behalf of the Australian government.I would have thought most members of this parliament would be sensible enough to know that this commission of inquiry is not the right thing. It is an endeavour to try to clear the names of Messrs Ne'e and Dausabea in particular, who are facing charges in relation to the riots in April. These two men were both made ministers when Mr Sogavare became the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands. Frankly, this has been a matter of very great concern to the Australian government, and it should be. We should be objecting to this. Frankly, to declare Mr Cole persona non grata is completely and utterly inappropriate.Let me make two final points. The first is this: we will continue our work with the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands because that regional assistance mission, a Pacific-wide mission led by Australia, is providing enormous benefits to the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands. There may be some people in Solomon Islands politics who object to RAMSI standing between them and the honey pot, but there is no doubt that as far as the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands are concerned RAMSI is a great thing. Finally let me say: we really do appreciate in this incident the strong support we are getting from our partners from other countries in the region and beyond. I think this is a time when all of us should show our solidarity with Patrick Cole, who has been treated abominably. He is a good and decent Australian, a hard-working public servant and he should not have been treated in this shabby way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. I certainly acknowledge his strong support for the many private doctors, private hospitals and also public hospitals in his electorate. I can inform the House that nearly all of the state Labor governments make good use of the private sector to, amongst other things, reduce their public hospital waiting lists. Many of the state Labor governments also use the private sector, including the for-profit private sector, to actually run some of their public hospitals - for instance, Noosa public hospital in Queensland, which is run by Ramsay Health Care corporation, as are the Joondalup public hospital in Perth and the excellent Mildura public hospital in the electorate of Mallee. There is Healthscope, another for-profit private company, which runs the Modbury Public Hospital in South Australia. There are the great religious charities which have long run some of the largest public hospitals in Australia, such as St Vincent's public hospitals in Sydney and Melbourne and Calvary Public Hospital here in Canberra.The Keating government in a responsible moment privatised the management of those great repatriation hospitals, such as Greenslopes in Brisbane and Hollywood in Perth, to the great benefit of patients and taxpayers. The state Labor governments are not embarrassed by using the private sector. For instance, we had the New South Wales health minister earlier this year saying:The Government is unapologetic about using services in the private sector ... where it's otherwise better value for money to be able to provide ... those services and more efficient to do so in the private sector.Premier Bracks wants to 'use the innovative skills and abilities of the private sector in a way that is most likely to deliver improved services to the community' - including using a for-profit private company to deliver support and cleaning services in the new women's hospital in Melbourne. Unlike responsible Labor politicians, the member for Lalor will always grab the chance to smear the private sector. - She said yesterday:... what's public about a hospital that's managed for profit and who's generating this profit? Is it coming out of the pockets of patients?The member for Lalor does not like being told it, but she is still a socialist at heart. She hates the private sector. Then there was the dog whistle on health. She said yesterday:Do they - Australians - want an American-style health system in this country with Medibank Private gone and then Medicare on the chopping block?Quite apart from the knee-jerk anti-Americanism involved there, the member for Lalor thinks that, if you say 'privatise Medibank' fast enough, people might think the government wants to sell Medicare itself. That is the dog whistle that she is practising.Let me make it absolutely clear that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. We understand that public health services in this country have long been delivered by the private sector. It is high time the member for Lalor gave the private sector the credit it deserves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I did listen very intently to the speech he made in the House on Monday evening when he highlighted the battles that state government schools in his electorate are having with the New South Wales Labor government -  - to get funding for basic infrastructure needs. He cited the example of the largest state government primary school in his electorate, Narranga Primary School, which had been looking for funding for a library reading room. The New South Wales Labor government would not provide the funding, so the parents raised every single cent of funding for that library reading room. Now they find that every time they seek funding for some basic works the parents are called upon to provide the funding, whether it is for pathways, drainage or seating. In recent years, the parents of the children at this school have raised three times the amount of funding for basic capital works as the New South Wales government has provided.Now the school is seeking funding for a school hall. This is a school with some 600 pupils. It does not have a school hall; it has no facility for assemblies, indoor sport or drama. The New South Wales government have told the school no and said that they have already been too generous to this school because a couple of years back they upgraded the toilets. So they are not going to give them any more funding for a school hall.This is just not good enough. It is cases like this that led the Australian government to introduce the $1 billion Investing in our Schools program. State government schools across Australia are having to turn to the Commonwealth to get funding for basic infrastructure needs.In the electorate of Cowper, already, after rounds 1 and 2, $3 million has been invested by the Commonwealth in funding for state government schools. Across New South Wales, 1,500 applications have been successful and over $100 million has now been invested by the Commonwealth. In round 3 we already have 3,000 applications. There are only 2,000 state government schools in New South Wales. For a side of politics that pretends to care about public education -  - it is astounding -  The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 - It is a disgrace that state Labor governments are not investing in their schools. I call upon the federal Labor Party to require state Labor governments to properly and adequately fund state government schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and also for the hard work he does for the resources sector in Australia in creating jobs and exports out of his electorate of Kalgoorlie. Australia's resources sector has reached another milestone today, with ABARE releasing figures that show Australia's mineral and energy sector has exported a massive $90.5 billion worth of exports in 2005-06. This is a record amount representing an increase of 32 per cent on 2004-05. Commodities leading that charge include coking coal, up 59 per cent; iron ore and pellets, up 54 per cent; and copper, up 79 per cent. It is an outstanding result by any measure, with some 90 advanced resources projects underway with further opportunities for growth.I am asked by the member for Kalgoorlie about uranium export potential from his electorate. Unfortunately, the outlook is not as positive. In Western Australia alone, five mining leases over uranium deposits were granted before 2002. The uranium deposits are estimated to be worth some $2 billion and under Labor's no new mines policy have no prospect of ever being developed. This is a ridiculous situation and made even more farcical by the fact that last month Australia announced its fourth uranium mine in South Australia, and that uranium mine has been given its commercial go-ahead.It just goes to show that in pro uranium mining states like South Australia the no new mines policy is an outdated inconvenience which is simply sidestepped by those Labor members who understand the importance of exports and jobs. Yet, in anti-uranium states like WA, where the WA Labor government opposes uranium mining, it is used to deny the opportunity of exports and dollars to that state. Either way, the no new mines policy is a complete shambles. It has completely divided Labor as to where it should go and, while the Labor Party ties itself in knots, the Howard government continues to grow the resources sector and do everything it can to build exports and build jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. It is a most important question for the economy and for all Australians who expect a fair go. The member for Grayndler a little while ago said in a press release:Persistent high levels of long-term unemployment are indisputable proof that the Howard Government's Job Network is failing to place the unemployed into jobs.This was amazing. This was followed up with an ABC Adelaide radio interview, where the journalist asked the member for Grayndler:'So you will take back, you will do away with the privatised network and you will bring all of these functions back into government if elected?'The member for Grayndler snapped back:No, certainly not.Of course, the member for Grayndler understood that the Job Network is an extraordinarily successful program. The latest figures show that the Job Network has delivered record-breaking numbers of job outcomes, especially for the long-term unemployed.In the last 12 months, Job Network has helped nearly 640,000 Australians, previously welfare dependent, into a real job. Nearly 47,000 of those jobs were for single parents, and that is a 57 per cent increase on the previous 12 months. We have also placed 11,000 people with a disability into employment - that is a new annual record. Almost 45,000 Indigenous Australians were found work. Mr Speaker, you know our Indigenous Australians have had some of the greatest difficulty finding jobs in previous generations. Most importantly, long-term unemployment has fallen by over 70 per cent since 1993. That is 230,000 fewer people - fewer families - who have been locked into long-term unemployment.You need to compare these statistics to when long-term unemployment actually peaked at 330,000 in May 1993. Yes, it is a significant date: it was when the Leader of the Opposition was employment minister. That is when long-term unemployment peaked, very tragically, for the Australian people. What did the Leader of the Opposition, then the employment minister, say about this problem? He said that long-term unemployment was 'an almost intractable problem' and 'the guts of the problem is going to be there with us and it is growing'.Can you imagine what the long-term unemployed thought when they heard that dismissal? - They would have been depressed. They would have felt, in fact, written off and completely left to their own devices. - Ignored. Put simply, Labor ran up the white flag and left them stranded. Remember, it was the minister for employment - the current Leader of the Opposition - who also dismissed unemployed 55-year-olds and said, 'Put them on the old age pension.' What a disgrace! So Labor had no plan to help the unemployed then; they have no policy now. The John Howard government has revolutionised the way we help the unemployed into work. -  - We are meeting the challenges of an ageing population and a booming economy, and we are delivering a better life to those Labor simply consigned to the scrap heap. - </DOC>

Despite the worst perfidious attempts of the Australian Labor Party, he has repulsed them on every occasion since he has been elected.The media laws recognise the way in which the media landscape in this country has changed since they were introduced in 1987. The House ought to be reminded that the media changes that were introduced in 1987 were not designed to promote good public policy; they were designed to cripple two media companies that did not enjoy the patronage of the Australian Labor Party - namely, the old Melbourne Herald group and, at that time, the Fairfax group. I hear all of this malarky lately about how there was some inspired motive in 1987, but it was all cheap politics in 1987 and now we are getting a bit of proper examination with the aim of getting decent public policy. We have introduced the legislation and the Senate committee will have a look at it. I will be very happy to look at reasonable suggestions made by colleagues but I certainly will not be taking too much advice from current or former leaders of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Just as Tony Blair famously said in 1997, fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. I can truly say that real choice in the workplace started in 1996, when the workplace relations legislation of the government was introduced. That legislation for the first time allowed for the operation of Australian workplace agreements. It preserved the right of choice of men and women in this country to join or not to join a union and it preserved the legitimate role of the trade union movement in negotiating on behalf of workers where that was the desire of the workers, but it broke the monopoly that the union movement had previously held on the bargaining process. That change was long overdue.As a result, there have been enormous benefits for the Australian economy. We have had 1.9 million new jobs created in the last 10 years. We have seen industrial disputes fall to such a situation where they are at a record low. We have seen real wages increase by 16.4 per cent over the last 13 years, compared with a paltry increase or no increase at all under the former government. So the choice of the last 10 years has been manifestly beneficial to the Australian community.As a result of Work Choices, passed into law at the end of last year and coming into operation on 27 March this year, we have seen another 175,000 jobs created. I know the opposition hates that fact. It has all been the wrong sort of news. There were meant to be ashes in our mouths as a result of the introduction of Work Choices but instead of that, I am sorry to say, there are 175,000 new jobs. We have seen in the last quarter the lowest level of industrial disputes on record in this country. This is a vindication of the commitment this government has made to the principle of choice - a vindication of choice. The Australian people have always responded when they have been given the incentive of choice.Sadly, if the Australian Labor Party returned to the government benches, they would take away that choice. The Leader of the Opposition says: 'If I become Prime Minister, I will get rid of AWAs and I will introduce collective bargaining. I will impose collective bargaining on a workplace if a bare majority of people in that workplace vote in favour of it.' I think that is what the Leader of the Opposition said. If you can sort of pick your way through the ALP website and decipher the doorstop, you will find that basically that is what the Leader of the Opposition said.But that is not good enough for Mr Combet. Mr Combet said that even if there is just one person in an enterprise who is a union member then the union has to have a seat at the table, irrespective of the wishes of that individual worker - the majority does not count them. So you have this ridiculous situation where both the Leader of the Opposition and the ACTU secretary would roll back the choice that was conferred in 1996 and reinforced in 2005.Let us not kid ourselves. As time goes by the Leader of the Opposition, despite what he might say over the next few days, will end up capitulating to the even more extreme version. -  - Well they laugh! I remember that earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition said that if he became Prime Minister he was going to keep AWAs. He said that. He said earlier this year: 'A Beazley government will keep the AWAs. We will do them differently, but we will keep them.' That was not good enough for John Robertson of Unions New South Wales. He said, 'If you want to remain leader of the Labor Party, you'll tear up AWAs and you'll come out against them.' And what happened at the state conference of the ALP at Sydney Town Hall? The Leader of the Opposition marched in and said: 'I will do what the union movement wants me to do: I'll tear up AWAs.' You can be sure of one absolute, eternal truth about Australian politics: if you want choice in the workplace, if you want higher wages, if you want more jobs, vote for the coalition.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question -  -  - The answer to that question is no. The truth is that Australians are taking up AWAs in record numbers. By the time the next election rolls around, there will be potentially more than one million AWAs in this country and the Leader of the Opposition will have to justify to one million Australians why he wants to tear up their employment entitlements and cut their living standards.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and acknowledge that he has been integral, along with the organisations in Cairns, in helping prepare for the 20th anniversary of the Cairns Group ministerial meeting to be held in Cairns next week. I thank the member for Leichhardt and look forward to him participating in those events and meetings next week.The Cairns Group was established by Australia 20 years ago as a key component to drive the agenda as far as agricultural trade liberalisation is concerned. It has a membership of 18 countries that all have a common view about liberalising the trade in agricultural products, and next week we will have the 20th anniversary of the meeting of that group in Cairns. The Prime Minister will join me in Cairns with trade representatives from many other countries across the world, including the Director-General of the WTO and two ministers from the United States - the USTR, Susan Schwab, and also the ag secretary, Mike Johanns. It is an integral part of the WTO and it is an integral part of Australia's trade policy in trying to force open markets through the multilateral system. At the same time, we have been actively pursuing our bilateral agenda and providing opportunities in the international marketplace for Australia's commercial interests, and that has fed into last year's record level of exports of goods and services out of Australia of $192 billion. That has grown over the last 10 years from $99 billion to $192 billion.But it has not just been founded on developing and opening up markets across the world and providing new opportunities for Australia's exporters; it has been about providing a much stronger and better structured economic circumstance within Australia to make them more internationally competitive. We have maintained a strong economy for that reason. In the tax reform processes we have removed significant dollars, in terms of taxes, off our exports. We improved the inefficiency of the waterfront, which to many exporting industries has been the one and most significant reform that has delivered enormous benefits to them and allowed them to compete in the international marketplace. And, of course, we have provided for a more flexible workplace for the workers in export industries across Australia. I instance Queensland, the state where the member for Leichhardt comes from, and Western Australia particularly. We have seen unemployment drop nationally to 4.9 per cent. In Western Australia it has dropped to 3.6 per cent and in Queensland it has dropped to 4.5 per cent as a result of growth in exports and flexibility in the workplace.This climate in Australia and the competitive nature of our export industries are threatened by the position that the Labor Party is taking as far as industrial relations are concerned. The Leader of the Opposition and the Secretary of the ACTU have said that they are going to rip up AWAs. They are going to reduce that flexibility and reduce that comparative advantage that we have in the international marketplace - the competitiveness that we have developed in the international marketplace. Now they are saying that they are going to reintroduce collective bargaining, and we saw the member for Perth trying to step away a bit from this in the media yesterday. 'I'm happy to give it due consideration,' is what the member for Perth said about the collective bargaining proposal of the Leader of the Opposition and Greg Combet, but we do know from the position taken on AWAs that when the unions say, 'Jump,' the Leader of the Opposition says, 'How high?' That is the position he has taken on AWAs, and we know the position he will take on collective bargaining, but what exporters also want to know is what work practices he is going to reintroduce back on the waterfront, where we have generated some efficiencies. What is he going to do to our exporters on the waterfront? It is a stark choice for the electorate in Australia: you have the coalition government that wants to stand with and work with job creators; you have the Australian Labor Party that wants to work with the job destroyers in this country.</DOC>

 - The track record of accuracy of allegations made by the member for Perth regarding Work Choices is about one out of 10 since Work Choices was introduced - and that is being charitable. I do not intend to confirm or verify anything. If the member for Perth wants to send me the workplace agreement, I would be very happy to have a look at it. But let me remind the member for Perth that in the last almost six months that this legislation has been in operation every single one of his prophecies of gloom has been disproved. You said there would be mass sackings; there have been mass hirings. You said there would be mass strikes; there has been a record period between industrial disputes. You said wages were going to be cut; wages have continued to grow very strongly in real terms. If the member for Perth wants to get into a debate about which side of politics can better boost the pay packets of Australian workers, we will welcome it very warmly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I inform the House that the APEC finance ministers had their meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, last weekend. Principally the topics for discussion were fiscal and on how countries would manage to pay for much-needed social services. Australia, as one of the few countries in the Asia-Pacific region with a balanced budget, was able to share its experience with regional neighbours and also its experience of paying off all government debts and establishing a Future Fund, about which there is considerable interest in the region as countries think about the future of their finances.The meeting will be chaired by and held in Australia next year as part of Australia's chairing of APEC in 2007. In addition to that we begin preparing for the G-20 group of finance ministers and central bankers meeting in Melbourne in November - the most important and significant financial conference ever held in Australia. The G-20 is a group bringing together the developing and the developed world, and it has given real impetus to reform of international financial institutions such as the Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Also part of discussions in Melbourne in November will be energy security and the needs of both exporters and importers in the region.As part of my duties as chairman of the G-20 I was in South Africa yesterday. I took the opportunity to announce that Australia is prepaying 10 years to the World Bank as its share of writing off unsustainable debts by heavily indebted poor countries. That sum of $136 million was paid yesterday. The consequence of that is that no debt is now owed to Australia by any heavily indebted poor country. We have written off 100 per cent of all of those debts, and, as our contribution to allowing the World Bank to write off its debts commensurately, we have now prepaid 10 years of our contribution to freeing the Third World of unsustainable debt. We are one of very few countries in the world that have done this. We have taken a lead in doing it and I believe this is something that all Australians can be proud of.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated in answer to the member for Perth that I do not take at face value allegations that he puts to me. I will examine the situation. But what I do take at face value - and I am entitled to and the House is entitled to take it at face value - is the fact that in 1996 the unemployment rate in the Australian Capital Territory was 7.7 per cent and in 2006 it is 2.8 per cent. That means that thousands of men and women in the ACT have had the great freedom of choice of a job under this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. As she knows, this government has been working hard for the last 10 years to ensure not only the creation of more jobs in Australia but that the real wages of Australians continue to rise. Wages have risen 16.4 per cent in real terms over the last decade, while figures for the June quarter show wages going up by an annualised 4.4 per cent this year and the economy remaining strong so that Australians can have a sense of belief in their future in this country.The latest piece of evidence in relation to this matter is the long-term unemployment data. I can inform the House that the latest long-term unemployment data shows that the number of long-term unemployed in Australia fell by 9,300 in August to stand at 90,700, which is a record low for the number of long-term unemployed people in Australia. Indeed, since 1996 that figure has more than halved.The member for Lindsay also asked me about these proposals by the Leader of the Opposition to introduce compulsory union bargaining in Australia. So far the Leader of the Opposition has given two examples as to why we should have this plan to take Australia back to the past in relation to compulsory union bargaining. The first example he gave was of Radio Rentals in Adelaide. What he forgot to say was that the Radio Rentals case is a dispute which has arisen because a certain handful of workers there decided that they did not want to take what the union recommended to them - namely, a union collective agreement. So this is a furphy as an argument for what the Leader of the Opposition says. His second example was the Boeing dispute, but he also failed to say in relation to the Boeing dispute that the majority of workers in fact did not want a collective agreement. This points out not only his weak attempt at justifying this policy but also that, if his policy is going to work according to these examples, what he is actually going to adopt is what the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, said yesterday: it does not require a majority of workers; it only requires one or two workers in a particular workforce. Indeed, when you read further into what Mr Combet said, he is proposing that we return to the system essentially of industry-wide pattern bargaining in this country that operated in the 1980s. Industry pattern bargaining takes no account whatsoever of the individual circumstances of any business; it just imposes a 'one size fits all'. What a policy to drive inflationary pressure in this country. This once again shows how incompetent the Leader of the Opposition is so far as economic management is concerned. When it comes to protecting the jobs of Australians, the Leader of the Opposition has no interest whatsoever. These proposals show that he is simply not up to the job.</DOC>

 - I certainly hope not. I must say that I have enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Australian Federal Police. I think they do a great job. They perform their duties in a completely apolitical fashion, and that is precisely what they should do. What I said yesterday was that I had had a meeting with the leadership of the Australian Federal Police Association only a couple of weeks ago. I said my recollection was that during that meeting they did not raise any matters remotely close to what had been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. After question time I had a look at the record of interview of the discussion - the notes. I checked my notes. - I was reassured checking my notes. Not only did the gentlemen of the Australian Federal Police not appear to be onto me, but they really did not raise any of the matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition. They raised other matters, and I undertook to pursue those matters. All I can say is that in that discussion the sorts of matters alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition were not raised.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. In answering his question, I note that the unemployment rate in the O'Connor electorate has fallen to 3.8 per cent. We are all aware that yesterday at the National Press Club the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, delivered his vision for a workers' nirvana in Australia. In trying to defend this vision, Mr Combet gave some very interesting answers, and one in particular caught my attention. I put it in this context because, repeatedly over this year, we have had from the Leader of the Opposition a demand that the government guarantee that no single worker in Australia would be worse off as a result of changes to workplace relations. Indeed, under pressure to match his rhetoric in June, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Nothing we do is going to make people worse off.' That is a promise which the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, refused to give yesterday. He was asked by a journalist after his address at the Press Club: 'Can you guarantee the Australian public that, if this proposal were put forward, there would be no job losses at all?' There was a very complicated, confusing answer from Mr Combet, but the basic bottom line is that he refused to give a guarantee that nobody would be worse off in his great workers' nirvana in Australia if this blueprint were to be put into place.The reality is that of course workers would be worse off. The ripping up of AWAs, the imposition of collective bargaining, the extended rights of entry into workplaces, the imposition of a new payroll tax on businesses in Australia - all of these things which are part of the ALP's policy under the Leader of the Opposition - would make hundreds of thousands of Australians worse off and would not lead to the job creation that we have seen over the last 10 years.What all of this suggests is this that when it comes to policy in Australia, when it comes to looking at the future of this country, when it comes to meeting the challenges that we face in Australia, the Leader of the Opposition is simply not up to the job. To quote Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin this week, 'When Kim Beazley makes a stupid statement, he does his best to ensure that it is really stupid.'</DOC>

 - I did not hear that particular quote on ABC radio this morning. I believe, however, that the policies of this government, with our end results of low inflation, very low interest rates and huge reductions in unemployment, have contributed to the aggregate capacity of Australians to not only buy a new home but to buy an even more valuable new home. It is true, and it is, in a sense, ironic that the lower the interest rates the more people are encouraged to borrow. As a result some people, particularly those who deal with non-bank lenders, end up overextending themselves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for the question. This government believes in helping to create jobs, and this government believes in helping to fill the job vacancies that are created. Over the last few months alone, Centrelink has referred to the Job Network more than 130,000 single parents who have been interested in getting a job. Those people are looking for flexibility in the workplace. They want to be able to pick up the kids from school. If one of their kids is sick they want to be able to take time out or to work from home. They want flexibility in the workplace that allows them to be able to earn a buck to improve their quality of life and that allows them, at the same time, to be able to meet their family needs.There is no doubt that the Work Choices legislation has delivered greater flexibility for Australian workers in the workplace. There is no doubt about that, and it fundamentally appeals to people who really do want to get a job but who are single parents and have been on welfare. That is the group that we have been targeting. We make no apologies for that, because the outcome is that the number of people participating in the workplace is at the highest level on record.The member for Page would appreciate that in his electorate alone there are over 4,300 small businesses employing people and in particular that there are over 12,000 small businesses that have not started employing people. By having a flexible workplace, a flexibility that applies to both the worker and the employer, we can create more jobs. No matter what the Labor Party does, no matter what people from the Labor Party say - be it the organ grinder down at the National Press Club or his representative in the chamber here today - understand this: the Labor Party is opposed to flexibility for the workers; the Labor Party is opposed to empowering people to get jobs. Under the coalition, in a flexible workplace people have higher wages and better job security, and for the first time many Australians are getting a job.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. It is fair to say that this government is proud of its role in the great coalition that removed Saddam Hussein from power and is glad that Saddam is no longer a threat to his people, to the Middle East or to anywhere else. His weapons of mass destruction programs are gone. He produced those weapons; he used them. In his second trial, which is on this week, he stands accused of killing an estimated 100,000 Kurdish men, women and children, including by the use of chemical weapons. Witnesses have testified about bombs in 1987 producing clouds of green poisonous gas that sent civilians screaming through their villages blinded and vomiting. Saddam Hussein can no longer perform these deeds. No longer will he finance suicide bombers, shelter other terrorists or, for that matter, invade his neighbours. Some people in this House may say that he should still be in power, but for our part we are proud that we played a role in overthrowing him.The best judges of this debate are, curiously enough, not the Australian Labor Party, and not necessarily the government. The best judges of this debate are the Iraqi people. A recent poll in the Sydney Morning Herald - and that is hardly a newspaper that has been passionately our way on this issue - showed that, despite the hardships of the people of Iraq, 77 per cent of Iraqis agree that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was worth while. That is something for the House to reflect on. That is the view of the Iraqi people. It may not be the view of the Australian Labor Party -  - but, as a matter of fact, that is a matter that is rather incidental to the people of Iraq. Let me go further and say that even if you disagreed with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, as many have, it is - in the government's submission - absurd to argue that defeat of the fledgling Iraqi democracy through premature withdrawal would be a good thing. If the terrorists were to win in Iraq it would be a catastrophic setback in the war against terrorism.Osama bin Laden understood this when he said that a loss in Iraq by the United States and the free world would lead to the US having to withdraw in 'defeat and disgrace forever'. Obviously, such a withdrawal would be a triumph for Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is not alone. President Ahmadinejad of Iran shares that view as well. We know that here in Australia the Labor Party has said that in the event of it being elected it would immediately withdraw Australian forces from Iraq.You could make an argument that, if America stayed there and Australia did not, America could still battle on alone. I noticed on Channel 10 the other night the Leader of the Opposition saying that 'we ought to be encouraging the Americans to uncouple themselves from Iraq as well'. In other words, as the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition would go to Washington and say to the President of the United States, 'What we would like you to do is join us in hauling up the white flag in Iraq and withdrawing and allowing that country to be taken over by the terrorists.' It is another classic example of two things. The first is the Leader of the Opposition being a bit of a charlatan when it comes to international relations. He pretends to be some kind of an expert. Secondly, it does confirm a view that many Australians hold: that the Leader of the Opposition is weak.</DOC>

They started off at a very low base because they were not exporting any wheat there. What I will take responsibility for is going to Iraq in February of this year on behalf of Australian wheat growers and getting them the opportunity to bid in a tender for 350,000 tonnes of wheat, which they won. They have the opportunity to bid in a tender that is underway again now for further exports of their wheat to Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert very much for his question and, more importantly, a very deep conviction about and commitment to the Defence community of Townsville. Just after lunchtime today, about 110 Australian soldiers returned to Australia. They were welcomed by the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who passed on to them my admiration on behalf of the government and the member for Barton's on behalf of the opposition. They were led by Major Kyle Tyrrell. These men and women have returned from the security detachment in Baghdad.Major Tyrrell is one of five Australian soldiers who will, in returning, be introduced to their newborn babies, born during the deployment. These young soldiers undertook 80 operations in the streets of Baghdad. They are not only soldiers; they are required to be diplomats, aid workers and teachers and to exercise judgement in extremely difficult circumstances on the streets of Baghdad with their ASLAVs every single day that they have been there. It was of course last month that this security detachment sustained the rocket attack which injured four of our soldiers. I am very pleased to say, having spoken several days ago to Corporal Sarah Webster, that she is recovering very well in Townsville.Our Defence Force men and women voluntarily join the Australian Army, Air Force and Navy, but their families in many cases basically are involved in a different way. On behalf of the government I particularly pay tribute to the families who supported these men and women during their deployment. The normal issues that are involved in relationships and households are compounded greatly when people are away, and I especially thank them. I was in Baghdad only two weeks ago - in fact, two weeks today, I had the privilege of being able to speak to the soldiers of the security detachment about the job that they have done on our behalf. Amongst the small group of journalists who attended with me was the Channel 7 personality David Koch. In speaking of the security detachment upon his return he said: 'Those security guys in the security detachment, they do an extraordinary, extraordinary job. You come away absolutely inspired by our men and women.'During that visit I also had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister of Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki. During that meeting, in relation to Australia's support for Iraq, he said that his country was particularly grateful for Australia's support and pleased that Iraq has reached a stage where security responsibility could be transferred in some areas of Iraq. Establishing democracy, he said, would take time. Despite scenes of blood and terror, Iraqis covet their newly found political and economic freedoms. I say to all Australians, and in particular I say to the opposition, who do not support what Australia is doing along with other countries to support the Iraqi people themselves: these people have no less a right to freedoms than Australians, East Timorese or anybody else. On returning to Australia the security detachment and our soldiers can be very proud of what they have done on behalf of our country -  -  - All Australians are proud of them for doing the job in our name and doing the job for the Iraqi people.</DOC>

He also, in that same statement, made it perfectly clear that he could make findings of fact that were damaging to Commonwealth officers, including ministers. Any logical reading of those two statements would lead you to the conclusion that, if Commissioner Cole thought it necessary to seek an extension of terms of reference so that he could fully adjudicate on the behaviour of ministers, he would do so. It is ludicrous of the member for Griffith to maintain otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I appreciate her strong support for the health professionals in her area, many of whom require the private health insurance system to sustain them. Let me make it clear to the House, including the member for Forde, that support for private health insurance remains one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks to these policies, particularly the private health insurance rebate, private health cover has grown from just 30 per cent to some 43 per cent of the population. That means than nine million Australians, including 40,000 people in the electorate of Forde, now enjoy the security and choice given to them by private cover. Next year the government will make a good product even better by allowing the funds to extend their basic tables to cover treatments that will reduce or avoid the need for hospitalisation.Despite the obvious success of our private health insurance system, members opposite still want to rip the guts out of it. They hate private health insurance. They particularly hate the private health insurance rebate, which the Leader of the Opposition once described as an extraordinarily bad piece of public policy which, in his words, 'reinforced failure'. Then we have the member for Perth, who described the rebate as 'a public policy crime'. At the last election, members opposite said they would keep the rebate. But we know that they had a secret plan to destroy it. The former Leader of the Opposition, in his celebrated diaries, said that Medicare Gold was 'my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate'. - I know why the member for Grayndler does not like the diaries - because of what Mark Latham said about the member for Grayndler. Mark Latham said:Medicare Gold was part of my plan for killing the private health insurance rebate ... It required a lot of work to model the private health insurance applications and to secure the cooperation of the states, all handled by Gillard.This week, the member for Lalor said again that she actually supported the private health insurance rebate. But, given Labor's history of duplicity on this subject, you cannot take her assurances at face value. We know from what she said this week that she hates private health insurance. - She is still a socialist at heart, and she wants to turn Medibank Private into Medibank Public. That is what she wants to do. It is now up to the Leader of the Opposition to say exactly where he stands on private health insurance. In particular, will he keep the rebate and will he give an undertaking not to means test it or otherwise limit it? If he will not do that, the Howard government is not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had but the only friend that private health insurance has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for the question and acknowledge his keen interest in helping to secure the safety of passengers in our airline system. The Australian government has spent $1.2 billion on upgrading security at our airports and in our aviation industry over recent times. The industry and airports themselves have also made a significant contribution. We have issued 100,000 aviation security identification cards; we screen all passengers and their carry-on luggage going onto jet aircraft; there is improved physical security at city and country airports; air security officers are on selected flights; there are hardened cockpit doors on all passenger aircraft with 30 seats or more; and we have dedicated airport police commanders and a strengthened police presence at our major airports. Those are examples of some of the initiatives that have been taken that are making a difference. I was interested to read a survey which demonstrated that the Australian public has a high degree of confidence in the security measures that we are putting in place.That is why I think it is especially disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Brisbane seek to undermine public confidence in our security system by making dishonest, irresponsible and reckless claims about what happens in relation to airport security in Australia. As an example, the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly claimed that international baggage is not subject to X-ray screening. The member for Brisbane has said it on occasions, although I note he has not said it in recent times because he knows the statement is wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has been told time and time again that all international baggage is screened - 100 per cent. It has been the law since the end of December 2004. Yet, on 4 September, the Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement in which he said that baggage is not all checked. He said it in a doorstop interview outside Parliament House on the same day. Earlier this week, he went even further. On 2UE he said:... ensuring all baggage, particularly overseas baggage, is X-rayed, and not all of it is.He went further and said:Only about 10 per cent of it's checked.That is simply wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has been told time and time again that 100 per cent of it is X-rayed. He has been told that at this dispatch box. He is not listening now; he will probably go outside again and make the same inaccurate statement. The reality is that it is not 10 per cent checked; it is 100 per cent checked. It is time that he was honest about it. The member for Brisbane comes in here -  -  - Now that the Leader of the Opposition is clearly listening, let me tell him one more time: 100 per cent of international baggage is X-rayed, not 10 per cent as he said a couple of days ago. Don't say it incorrectly again. The member for Brisbane goes on about doors at Sydney airport, and gates at Dubbo and Ballina. Each time, the council has come back categorically and demonstrated to him where he was wrong in what he said. - I have been going through some of the reckless and irresponsible claims made by the member for Brisbane about airport security. Finally, I refer to his comments on Broken Hill radio this week, when he said:People who have travelled in jets know that cockpit doors are hardened. That's not so with those propeller-driven aircraft.Wrong again! This government has funded a program to ensure that all of those cockpit doors are indeed hardened. Once again, the member for Brisbane has invoked the wrath of a council about his irresponsible statements. This time it is the Broken Hill City Council. 
The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - Councillor Kennedy from the Broken Hill City Council said that for the member for Brisbane to make statements like these is irresponsible and a case of political point-scoring. Kennedy says, 'If a terrorist does take over a flight from Broken Hill the finger will be pointed at Bevis.' I think the reality is that it is high time the opposition were responsible in dealing with these issues. We have acted constructively to improve airport security. They should recognise the improvements that have been made and not seek to undermine them with reckless and irresponsible claims.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I am advised that there is seismic confirmation that North Korea conducted a nuclear test earlier today. In those circumstances I would condemn, and I assume I would have the unanimous agreement of the House in doing so, the test in the strongest possible terms. North Korea is very gravely mistaken if she thinks that a nuclear test will improve that country's bargaining position. The test has destabilised the region. It has eroded North Korea's own security. A strong international response is called for, and Australia will give full support to that response. I might point out that, in advance of today's very regrettable developments, the government has been working very closely in the context of not only its ongoing support for the six-party talks but also the activities that have been taking place in the Security Council of the United Nations; therefore our position and our cooperation with our allies is very well known.I might say that one of the more positive developments in this otherwise very regrettable saga took place over the weekend with the visit to Beijing of the newly installed Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Abe. If that visit heralds an improvement in relations between Japan and China that is a very welcome development indeed. As a country that has very close relations with both Japan and China, it has been a matter of regret to Australia that relations between those two countries have deteriorated so much in recent times. I welcome the initiative of the new Japanese Prime Minister, to whom I spoke on the telephone late last week conveying my congratulations on his election. I will have the opportunity of meeting him at the APEC meeting in Vietnam next month.Australia will call on the United Nations Security Council to take swift and effective action against North Korea and impose strong measures under chapter 7 of the United Nations charter. We will also advocate a UN Security Council regime against the DPRK that includes targeted financial and travel sanctions, other trade restrictions and/or aviation restrictions. Australia will also actively promote with other like-minded countries a concerted, strong international response through key regional mechanisms such as APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum.I know I speak for all Australians in saying that we are outraged that a country that has to rely on the international community to feed its own people and to bring them back from the brink of starvation devotes so many of its scarce resources to missiles and nuclear weapons progress. This issue represents a great challenge to the United Nations. We on this side of the House are often told that we do not pay enough regard to the processes of the United Nations. If the United Nations is to come up to scratch on this issue it will win great respect and an enhanced reputation. But if the United Nations fails to act effectively against this outrage from North Korea that will represent a further diminution of its authority.I think I can speak for everyone in this House in saying that we are both disturbed and outraged at this action by North Korea which should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. The suggestion that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition, for which I thank him, will be discussed and considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. This is a profoundly serious issue, and I think the Prime Minister has very comprehensively explained the approach of the Australian government to the issue. As I said, I think it is a profoundly serious issue, and one the House needs to focus on.There have been three processes through which the issue of North Korea has been addressed in recent times. The first and dominant process has been the so-called six-party talks, which includes North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Russia, China and the United States of America. The endeavour has been to try to get North Korea to move from a nuclear posture to cooperating fully with the international community and in response receiving significant quantities of aid and an opening up of trade and investment with the rest of the world. The six-party process has occurred occasionally but not often and, despite a framework being negotiated last year and an agreed statement being issued, North Korea has refused to return to those six-party talks.The Leader of the Opposition earlier asked the Prime Minister a question about convening a regional grouping of foreign ministers. To add to his point, I tell him that the week before last in New York the Secretary of State to the United States, Condoleezza Rice, convened the second of what is called the five-plus-five meeting, which is the six parties minus the North Koreans, of course, and five other countries in the region, including Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. This was a useful opportunity for us to make sure our positions are coordinated. Over the last few days we have had telephone contact with each other to make sure that, in the event of this test taking place, there will be a coordinated response. I think it is very possible that, for example, during the APEC meeting next month in Vietnam there will be another five-plus-five meeting. In the meantime, it is our view that the action should move straightaway to the United Nations Security Council. In the United Nations Security Council there must be a robust response.It is important that all members - and I focus here on the P5, the five permanent members - understand the importance of having a chapter 7 resolution and of specific measures being taken against the North Korean regime. I have some quiet confidence that that will be achievable. We will have to wait and see; I am not getting into canvassing the different views of the different governments. But, as the Prime Minister said a moment ago, one very important development and one very positive development in what is otherwise a rather gloomy day in international relations has been the summit between Prime Minister Abe and President Hu Jintao. It is good that China and Japan are beginning the process of reconciliation, and in this context of the North Korean nuclear test that is a very important development.The immediate focus should be on the Security Council - making sure the Security Council takes decisive action. I have quiet optimism that that is going to be possible, but the regional countries will certainly continue to cooperate and keep in contact with each other. One of the most important things here is to make sure there is a united - not just regional, frankly, but united - international response to this outrage of a test, assuming the test is confirmed. It is absolutely crucial that there is as united a position internationally as there possibly can be. I think that is possible.</DOC>

I share the quiet optimism of the foreign minister that the P5 will cooperate.

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. As he knows, from 1 July this financial year further income tax cuts were introduced for Australians, with a cut in the top marginal tax rate, an increase in the thresholds and an increase in the low income tax offset. They have put more money back into the hands of all Australian taxpayers, particularly middle-income earners. I have seen the claim that has been made by none other than the member for Lilley that somehow middle-income earners have missed out. - 'Too right,' he says. A person on average weekly ordinary time earnings today compared to where they were in 1996 is taking home, after tax, $169 a week more - after tax. Not only have wages increased but, of course, taxes have been cut. That person on average weekly ordinary time earnings would be on a top tax rate of 48½ per cent under Labor's tax scales, and that person today is on a top tax rate of 30c and does not go on to a higher bracket until $75,000. Right across the income distribution scale, not only have wages gone up but taxes have come down and put more money back into the hands of ordinary taxpayers.I was also asked whether there were any credible alternatives that were being put forward, and I must say my heart leapt a bit when I read the front page of the Australian today. According to the front page of the Australian today, with an exclusive from the member for Lilley, Labor is considering a radical plan to flatten the personal scales by scrapping the top or the bottom tax rate. Or the bottom! Well, there are only two in between; why not scrap all four, for that matter? But it was either the top or the bottom.Coming into the House of Representatives today the member for Lilley was asked about this plan: 'What is the main aim of abolishing the top and the bottom personal tax rates?' And he said, 'What we have to do is really deliver some incentive for those people who have missed out so far.' So it was on the front page of the Australian; it was still alive at nine o'clock this morning. But when 3AW broadcast its news at 1 pm, it broadcast the following: 'Kim Beazley is ruling out abolishing the top rate of tax for high-income earners.' So it was alive when the Australian was published; it was alive at nine o'clock. It was dead at 1 pm. I said of a former shadow treasurer that he could not hold a policy from Lateline to lunchtime. This shadow treasurer cannot hold one from breakfast to brunch! The policy which was alive at 9 am was ruled out at 1 pm. No wonder, when he was asked at 9 am, 'Will you be presenting this to caucus, this plan of yours?' he replied, 'No, I'm not even going to present it to caucus.' No wonder it could not be presented to caucus; it died at 1 pm today; it would not even have made it to 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning.</DOC>

 - The Chief Executive of Telstra is appointed by the board of Telstra and the board of Telstra determines his remuneration. The point I made on 29 September and the point the Treasurer made, I would be very happy to make again - and this applies to any highly paid chief executive in this country. If any person is paid a bonus, particularly at a chief executive level, over and above that person's normal remuneration then it is incumbent upon the board to be satisfied that the performance criteria which are meant to validate the bonus have in fact been achieved. That was the point that was made by the Treasurer and it is a point that I am very happy to repeat. I think the Australian people share the view that large Australian companies have got to pay competitive salary levels, but they also share the view that people who are highly paid in this country have got to earn every dollar they get paid.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Dobell for his question and I acknowledge his strong advocacy, in particular on behalf of allied health professionals and especially psychologists, who now have additional access to Medicare as a result of these measures. This morning the Prime Minister provided details of new mental health services available under Medicare, which are estimated to cost some $538 million over the next five years. There will be, under these new Medicare initiatives, mental healthcare plans from GPs, including the 93 equivalent full-time GPs in Dobell. There will be higher psychiatry rebates for many types of consultations. Most importantly, there will be access to up to 12 individual psychologist consultations and up to 12 group consultations a year for people on mental healthcare plans or there will be access to other allied health professional services for people on these plans, and I point out to the member for Lalor that there are some 10,000 psychologists in Australia, including almost 3,000 registered clinical psychologists, who ought to be able to access these plans.I want to thank the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for mental health, the member for Sturt, who has been principally responsible for devising this new initiative. Mental health is a very important subject. One in five Australians will at some stage experience a mental health problem; some one in 10 Australians suffer from significant mental illness. So this government is determined not to let these people down. These new measures are a sign of our determination to make a good system even better and a sign of the Howard government's determination to be indubitably the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - The government's approach in relation to the selection of Mr Cousins and his nomination to the board was no different from the approach that has been taken by the government in relation to a number of people - including a number of people who currently sit on the board of Telstra. So in that sense there is absolutely nothing unusual. It is true that the prospectus contains the view of the board, not a damning indictment. - I have read very carefully what the board has said about Mr Cousins. I would not regard what it said as a damning indictment, but the board has expressed a different view about Mr Cousins. Let me make it very plain: the government will be voting for Mr Cousins at the annual meeting and I feel reasonably confident that he will be elected at the annual general meeting. I think he will make an outstanding director, he will be utterly independent and he is not a stooge of the government, and the idea that because at some stage somebody has provided a consultancy to the government - or, indeed, any other government - that person is disqualified from future service on the board of a large corporation is absolutely ludicrous. Mr Cousins has an outstanding commercial record - he understands communications far better than many other people who talk about communications in this country - and I think he will bring status and quality to the board when, as I confidently predict, he is elected with a comfortable majority on 14 November.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question and for his support of what are certainly the largest superannuation changes in 20 years. I can inform him that great progress is being made. The consultation period has now finished and the government proposes to introduce legislation later this year so that the scheme is up and running on 1 July 2007. Under the changes to superannuation, when you are over 60 and you take your money out of a taxed superannuation fund there will be no tax on a lump sum, there will be no tax on a pension, the different age based contribution limits will be abolished and the post-tax contributions will also be simplified so that people have an incentive to put superannuation contributions into their fund over the whole course of their lifetime. We get rid of complicated tax, we get rid of RBLs, we get rid of age differentials and we really make superannuation the preferred form of saving in Australia.I regret to say that as of now the opposition still does not have a policy on superannuation. This policy was announced five months ago. We have been consulting with the industry and we have been having very productive discussions, but we have not heard a peep out of the opposition as to whether or not it will support these far-reaching changes. If we are going to encourage people to have confidence in superannuation, it is very important that this have bipartisan support. This needs bipartisan support so that people can have confidence that the money they put into superannuation in their 20s and their 30s and their 40s is going to be there after their 60s so that they can draw down on it. I am beginning to see a pattern as to why the opposition will not commit to supporting these superannuation changes -  - A very ominous sign in the Weekend Australian on 30 September 2006 was the headline 'Changes to super will go: Keating'. The article read:Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has warned superannuation tax changes may have to be cut back by future governments _What possible future governments could he be talking about there? None other than Labor, which will not go on the record as supporting these changes - and the reason they will not go on the record to support these changes is that the Leader of the Opposition wants the right to take away the tax concessions and grab people's money in future years. He does not want to go on the record. Mr Keating, his economic muse -  - The economic muse of the Leader of the Opposition, Paul Keating, has belled the cat. He wants these tax changes to go, he wants the Labor Party to have the freedom to take them, the Labor Party will not go on the record and, as a consequence, superannuation will not have the confidence that it deserves. I call on the Labor Party, I call on the Leader of the Opposition and I call on the shadow Treasurer to come out, back the changes and commit themselves to them for the long term so that in the future young Australians can have confidence in this preferred form of saving over the long term.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Obviously it is a question of great importance to all Australians. I inform the member for Mallee that already there has been $1.2 billion allocated since September 11 2001 to aviation security. That is quite a significant amount of money that has been budgeted by the government. Under our comprehensive aviation security regime, 250 regional airports and airlines are now security regulated for the first time. The Regional Airport Funding Program, which had $36.5 million to increase security measures, has already spent $30 million on 127 regional airports. The member for Mallee will be pleased to know that, as of this year's budget, along with airports at Burnie, Devonport, Groote Eylandt and Weipa, Mildura airport is eligible to apply for funding under the Regional Airport Funding Program. There was extra money allocated in the budget this year to implement security measures at Mildura airport.It needs to be recorded that we have a multilayered approach to aviation security. Measures range from the requirement for the aviation industry to have in place risk based transport security programs through the use of air security officers on selected flights to the requirement to have hardened cockpit doors in many aircraft. So a range of measures have been put in place that are very important. Our aim is obviously to protect Australians utilising aviation services in Australia, but it is just as important to reinforce the confidence of international travellers coming into Australia. We have taken those steps and introduced those measures progressively over recent years.We note that the Australian Labor Party in their aviation policy in the election in 2004 just suggested they were going to review the act. They have a long way to go to catch up with the government in terms of front-line investment in increasing and improving the security arrangements in Australia's aviation sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question and for his interest in what the government is doing in the Asia-Pacific region on climate change. In the first place, reflecting the depth of concern in this government about the problem, we have been one of the partners who have established the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, known as AP6. This brings into play in addressing the climate change issue countries like China, India, Korea, Japan and obviously us and the United States of America. I think it is enormously important if we are to address the issue of climate change to make sure that countries like China and India are involved in the whole process and are making a contribution to dealing with climate change. The AP6 initiative is a very important part of doing that. - Secondly - you would have to hear the interjections to believe them, honestly - which Pacific countries are in AP6? -  - China - they might exclude China -  - The United States is a Pacific country. Australia is a Pacific country. I think we include Japan. - This is the level of intellect we have to deal with from the opposition spokesman. - On the Pacific island countries, there are quite clear initiatives that Australia has taken over many years. Honourable members opposite might be interested to note that for many years there has been a Bureau of Meteorology sea level and climate monitoring project. Thirty-two million dollars has been spent on this project, with 12 sea monitoring sites throughout the Pacific coupled with GPS and satellite monitoring. These gauges demonstrate that there is a history of considerable annual and regional variation in sea level in the Pacific but a trend towards the sea level rising. I understand that since 1993 the average increase in sea level in the Pacific islands region and at those 12 monitoring stations has been about eight millimetres per annum, so this is clearly an issue.We have been helping the Pacific island countries with their priorities on climate change. We have helped to fund the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change 2006-2015, which the opposition is not aware of. There are a number of very practical projects that we have been assisting with such as the Vulnerability and Adaptation Initiative; the dissemination of scientific information to government and private sectors through awareness programs, including through the media; building meteorological capacity through the Climate Prediction Project and training Pacific staff on climate prediction, including extreme events; and exploring the potential of renewable energy, particularly in more remote Pacific island countries. Indeed, some projects are getting up and going.In conclusion, I make the point that the opposition continually, in a practice that we are all very familiar with, goes out and makes assertions against the government which are manifestly untrue - for example, that the government is doing nothing about climate change in the Pacific. I table for the interest of the House a list of a number of projects that are being funded by the government in the Pacific. If it ever came to who is struggling, it is the integrity of the opposition and how it addresses this issue. I would have thought that the member for Grayndler would place some premium on telling the truth, but he apparently does not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. I acknowledge his concerns about mental health services in the central west as well as the concerns of people like Senator Bill Heffernan, who is regularly lobbying me on this subject. I can tell the honourable member that I have discussed these matters on a number of occasions with the New South Wales Central West Division of General Practice and particularly with Dr Ross Wilson, who I speak with regularly. My understanding is that the psychology service run by the division has, in fact, been re-funded. That is my understanding, but I will certainly double-check that and confirm the facts to the member.Let me point out that as well as the new Medicare items announced today - again, thanks to the good offices of the parliamentary secretary, the member for Sturt - there is $52 million more to work with appropriate organisations such as divisions of general practice to provide mental health services in areas where there are few private doctors or private psychologists. I do believe that the new measures will help to develop a better private psychology market in areas such as the central west, but, as I said, there is $52 million more to help if that is not the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and also for his strong support - in fact, his initiatives - in regard to alternative fuels. The member for Macquarie was one of the first promoters of the LPG subsidy scheme for conversion and I congratulate him on his very strong interest in that. The scheme was announced in August and already we have seen unprecedented interest in the LGP conversion scheme, with some 50,000 public inquiries on the AusIndustry hotline. I am pleased to report to this House that in the first five days since the beginning of processing of these claims we have seen 1,734 grants - worth some $3.2 million - paid out under the scheme. These cheques have been dispatched to motorists who have chosen the LPG alternative.The ethanol infrastructure scheme, which was announced alongside the LPG scheme, has also been officially launched, with grants of up to $20,000 available to help service stations to install ethanol infrastructure as well as sell ethanol based fuel blends. Through these programs, our government is providing strong and consistent leadership on alternative fuels and we are seeing that the set target of 350 million litres of ethanol and biofuels is now well within our grasp. Already we have seen BP commit to deliver more than 400 megalitres of biofuels into the market annually by 2009. Australia's alternative fuel industry is growing and providing real choice and real savings to Australian motorists.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that employers, long before the introduction of Work Choices, had the right to propose a particular form of employment contract. It has been the law for more than a decade in this country that an employer could, consistent with something I am about to say, nominate that people, particularly new employees, be engaged on AWAs.The Leader of the Opposition would also be aware that under the new law it is unlawful for somebody to be coerced into signing an AWA. That is the law, and that law will be applied in relation to this site, as indeed for their others. I also inform the Leader of the Opposition that my advice about the unanimity of the reaction of the employees is different from that of the Leader of the Opposition. But let us wait and see.I also, as a footnote, add that I am aware that my department does not actually own the building. -  - I will tell you whose responsibility it is. It is owned by a trust representing industry superannuation funds, and on the board of this trust is a Mr John Sutton from the CFMEU. There are some sections of the CFMEU for which I have a certain affection, but I am not sure that Mr Sutton belongs in that section. If the Leader of the Opposition has some further concerns about this issue, perhaps he could have a chat with his friend John Sutton.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and, in answering it, I note that the unemployment rate in Hughes stands at 2.9 per cent. The constituents of Hughes are some of the many people throughout Australia who are getting the rewards and the benefits of changes to workplace laws. There have been 175,000 new jobs created in Australia since the introduction of Work Choices, real wages are continuing to grow and industrial disputes are at the lowest level in the history of this country.It is true that Australian workplace agreements are being taken up in quite considerable numbers. Indeed, last week the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity of visiting a disability service in South Australia, in the member for Wakefield's electorate, where the one millionth AWA had been signed. Mr Bob Raven was the employee who had signed the one millionth AWA. The one millionth AWA also coincided with the 100,000th AWA lodged under the Work Choices system.Let us look at some of the advantages for Mr Raven and his fellow employees - about 30 staff at Comrec's various disability support services in South Australia - under the AWA. They have, for example, the option of trading wage increases for additional leave. They have flexible start and finish times. They have the option of working from home and access to long service leave as single days. They have three days additional leave per year, accessible for any personal reason. They have things like study leave.All of those are advantages that Mr Raven, as he said to us last week, found attractive in this Australian workplace agreement and for him to work in this particular business. This is an example of the flexibility and the choice that Australian workers now have that they did not have in the past. These choices and this flexibility arise from the changes that this government has put in place. It is nonsensical to be taking away these choices. I noted in the West Australian on the weekend - and if the member for Brand ever visited Western Australia these days he might have noted it himself - an article on a worker in that state titled: 'Keep your hands off: miner tells union', and by extension the miner was telling the Leader of the Opposition that as well.The Leader of the Opposition has previously praised and acknowledged AWAs. Indeed, he previously acknowledged the sheer irresponsibility of abolishing AWAs when he said:There'll be a million of those things in place when we come into office and you can't wander around cancelling contracts.What happened? As soon as there was word of a challenge to the leadership of the member for Brand as the Leader of the Opposition of Australia, he raced into the ALP conference in Sydney and said, 'Well, I'm going to rip up Australian workplace agreements.' What he would do is to rip up the flexibility that the likes of Mr Raven have, the flexibility that up to a million Australians have already entered into with Australian workplace agreements. There is only one description for this, and that is economic vandalism.</DOC>

 - I have learned from experience that you never take at face value what the member for Perth says about the content of an Australian workplace agreement. I am advised that negotiations continue -  - in relation to the employees. I am further advised that the law of this country is that nobody can be sacked for refusing to sign an AWA. I continue to be advised that unemployment is at a record 30-year low in this country. My understanding is that although the unemployment rate in the ACT may not have reached the marvellous lows of the shire in which the electorate of Hughes is located it is sharply lower than it was 10 years ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question and for his very long commitment to defence and foreign policy. Every Australian should be proud of the fact that we have just over 500 Australian troops in Afghanistan at the moment, predominantly in Uruzgan, in central southern Afghanistan. They are there for two reasons. The first is to see that we contribute to fighting the global war against terror. No Australian should forget that the 88 Australians who were murdered in Bali were murdered by people who trained in Afghanistan - Muklas, Samudra and Hambali amongst others. The second reason that we are there is to support the Afghan people in their drive for democracy - something which goes hand in hand with stability and freedom for people.Over the last year we have had a special operations task group in Afghanistan of some 200 soldiers - commandos and members of the Special Air Service Regiment. They have done an outstanding job. In fact, 395 days of active service for those soldiers saw them undertake more than 100 missions and 139 contacts - or fights, if you like - with the anticoalition militia. There are many outstanding stories of gallantry and heroism which will be further told over the next few months and for which appropriate military recognition will be given to them.Uruzgan today is relatively stable, thanks to the hard work and bravery of those Australian soldiers. We now have 500 Australian soldiers, 270 in a reconstruction task force, working alongside 1,400 Dutch military personnel, under NATO. About half of them are tradies and engineers and the other half are ground force protection. They are in command, construction, intelligence, protection and logistics. They are involved in a range of projects: not only trade training for Afghans but also flood mitigation projects, building roads and culverts, reticulated water programs and a variety of things that are essential for the wellbeing of the people of Uruzgan. In addition to that, the government has deployed another company of 120 soldiers to provide ground force protection to them. We are very confident of the professionalism, leadership and equipment that our soldiers have. We know this is an important task. It is about protecting not only Afghan people but also Australia, our people, our interests and our values.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Werriwa: I have not seen those remarks in the local newspaper to which you have referred. If you would like to send me a copy of the local newspaper I will see what further inquiries I can make. In relation to take it or leave it or choice, I remind the member for Werriwa that one million people in the early nineties had to take it or leave it. Despite the massive protections that the law purported to give them, the economy in the early nineties was so weak that more than a million people were thrown out of work and all the legislative protections under the sun did not save them. I think the member for Werriwa should understand that the real test of an industrial relations system is the contribution it makes to strengthening the economy. The evidence so far is that the sky has not fallen in. We have 175,000 more jobs. We still have very high real wage growth. We have the lowest number of industrial disputes since records were kept. I think most Australians would take that rather than leave it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his commitment to Australian school based apprenticeships, particularly in his electorate, where schools such as Clairvaux MacKillop College are providing hundreds of students with opportunities to learn a trade while they are completing their year 11 and 12 studies. They are doing this through employers like Zupps, at Mount Gravatt, who have a fantastic commitment to taking on kids and giving them those opportunities.There are currently some 18,000 Australian school based apprenticeships, as at the end of March of this year, hundreds of them in Bonner alone. Commencements in Australian school based apprenticeships have increased by 23 per cent in the 12 months to March of this year, to 16,100 commencements. This compares with just 2,410 commencements in Australian school based apprenticeships in 1999 and, of course, zero when the Australian Labor Party was in government. Last year this government paid $14.6 million in financial incentives to Australian employers for school based apprenticeships. We are providing real choice - there is that word again: choice - for young Australians, giving them the opportunity to progress towards nationally recognised trade qualifications and work experience while they are at school.Mr Speaker, as you would know, being the member for Wannon, just last week we announced more funding for more of the Australian technical college program. All up, there will be $343.6 million for Australian technical colleges, which will provide opportunities for 7,500 students to take up Australian school based apprenticeships in years 11 and 12. We have announced 23 of the 25 Australian technical colleges and funding arrangements for 19. In the last few weeks alone, some $40 million in commitments have been announced in the upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia, in Darwin, and in Warrnambool in the electorate of Wannon. What we need is for state governments to reform the industrial relations impediments -  -  - Oh yes, here he goes. The state of New South Wales, the biggest state and the biggest economy but, as the Prime Minister rightly acknowledged last week, the state with the most lethargic economy in Australia, has the worst set of circumstances when it comes to school based apprenticeships. It is disgraceful to think that, in the state of New South Wales, no student is studying in the trades at certificate level I, II, III or IV in years 11 and 12. There are no school based apprenticeships.I noticed that the member for Rankin hopped on the bandwagon for school based apprenticeships a few weeks ago. About eight weeks ago he was mouthing the words of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, bagging Australian school based apprenticeships through the Australian technical college program. Last week he was on the bandwagon promoting them. We welcome his latter-day conversion on the road to wherever it was, but what I want him, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to do is to get onto the Western Australian government and, particularly, the New South Wales government to allow school based apprenticeships across all trades for year 11 and 12 students in those states. Without that it is a disgrace.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I think it is true to say that Australia has over the years, under governments from both sides of politics, played a very positive role in favour of measures to prevent nuclear proliferation. It is true that what North Korea has done is a very serious blow to the non-proliferation regime. Let me say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that the government is naturally considering a range of measures. I know that the foreign minister has been in contact with a number of his counterparts, including the American Secretary of State, and we will consider all of the options that are available which might be advanced in the cause of non-proliferation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The United Nations Security Council has now given some consideration to this issue. The views of the Security Council are unanimous and clear in terms of their condemnation of the nuclear test conducted by North Korea. The Security Council will now be considering what further measures it can take.As I pointed out to Secretary Rice last night, and as is well known, the Australian government believes that the Security Council should act under chapter 7 and that specific sanctions should be imposed on North Korea. It is my guess that the Security Council is likely to do that. There will be debate amongst members of the Security Council, however, over what sort of sanctions to impose. I am sure they will agree fairly rapidly to sanctions that have a bearing specifically on nuclear programs and perhaps missile programs, but further measures over and above that will obviously have to be debated in the Security Council.Today, I called in the Ambassador for North Korea, Ambassador Chon, and said - it will not come as a surprise to anybody - that the Australian government and, more importantly, the people of Australia condemned in the strongest possible terms the actions of North Korea in conducting a test. I told the ambassador that we would support Security Council sanctions under chapter 7 and that, over and above that, a measure that we would take immediately would be to deny visas to North Koreans who apply for visas to visit Australia except in exceptional circumstances.I made it clear to the ambassador that a nuclear test by North Korea was a threat to the peace and stability of a region which has enjoyed relative peace and stability for quite some time, particularly North Asia. I made the point to the ambassador that what the North Koreans had done had been not only in clear defiance of the wishes of the international community, which is united in its opposition to North Korean nuclear testing, but also significantly in defiance of representations made by North Korea's longstanding supporter, China; that this had put China in an embarrassing and humiliating position, and I regarded that as unacceptable. I thought that what the North Koreans had done was deeply offensive to a country on which it depended for its food aid and other forms of assistance and for its trade in such a significant way.I finished the discussion by pointing to a satellite photograph in my office, which I have had there for quite some time, of the Korean peninsula at night, which shows South Korea lit up and North Korea in the dark, and explained to him that this was a regime which had manifestly failed in looking after the interests of its ordinary people, yet was spending billions of dollars on developing nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons programs, and that this was completely unconscionable in the view of the Australian people.In conclusion, in terms of diplomacy, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister a little earlier about foreign ministers and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. There were a range of meetings along those lines - not precisely as described by the Leader of the Opposition - recently in New York, including the annual meeting of foreign ministers which I co-chaired, on support for the ratification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. We will continue our vigorous diplomacy, which, in Australia, as the Prime Minister has said, has been pursued by both sides of the House over many years, in support of the non-proliferation regime. It was our government that brought the comprehensive test ban treaty to the United Nations General Assembly and had it adopted there by a very large majority, and we continue to push for ratification.The problem is not that most countries are about to proliferate; the problem is the extremist regimes that are defying the views of the international community. What do we do in a situation where we have international norms, which most countries adhere to, but where a country like North Korea has withdrawn from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty altogether and defied the wishes of the international community? Certainly, we should use all of the strength that the Security Council can muster to address this issue.</DOC>

 - Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition appreciates it when it suits him, but on occasions when it does not suit him he does not appreciate that in a globalised world lots of tasks flow across borders from one country to another. Just as this country wants the advantages of globalisation, so it should be that we must accept that part of a globalised world is a much freer flow of information, and the idea that you can have an effective regulatory regime of the type he is talking about ignores the realities of the modern world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume. I know that in raising this issue he echoes the views of people representing rural Australia in this parliament. The present drought, which has continued since 2001, is the worst on record and it has required and will continue to require an unprecedented response from the government. Thirty-eight per cent of all agricultural land in Australia is now declared as being eligible for exceptional circumstances, which is an astonishingly high percentage of agricultural land.The Bureau of Meteorology's outlook to the end of 2006 notes a high likelihood of above average temperatures over much of the country. Rainfall data showed that August 2006 was the driest August in 100 years and the warmest since recordings began in 1950. Large parts of south-western Australia and south-eastern Australia have had the lowest winter rainfall on record, and rainfall from December 2005 to August 2006 was in the lowest 10 per cent of records for large areas of the Murray-Darling Basin. ABARE forecasts that grain and oilseed production will fall sharply by 34 per cent in 2006-07 to a low level of 23.8 per cent below the 10-year average. Wheat production is forecast to fall by around 35 per cent; canola, by 46 per cent; and rice, by 62 per cent.Over $1.2 billion has been provided by the Commonwealth government to more than 53,000 farm families since 2001. Under the existing exceptional circumstances arrangements, the Commonwealth pays 100 per cent of the income support and 90 per cent of the interest rate subsidies, with the remaining 10 per cent - a fairly nominal amount - being contributed by the states. We are spending at the moment $29 million a month on income support and interest rate subsidies.I have two other observations to make. The first of those is to address an assurance to the farm community of Australia - that is that as you enter a period of this prolonged drought you may rest assured that the Commonwealth government will meet its obligations to you as hard-pressed producers and you will continue to receive, as you have in the past, the assistance of the Commonwealth government. We will ensure that the exceptional circumstances arrangements operate speedily and effectively to make sure that the difficult circumstances that you now face are shared as fairly as they can be within the broader Australian community.I also make the observation that many Australian farmers are being assisted through this very severe drought by the operation of the Farm Management Deposits scheme, which allows taxable primary production income to be set aside in profitable years to be drawn down later. In that connection, farmers' deposits have increased in value from $1 billion in early 2002 to $2.4 billion in March of 2006. It would not be exaggerating circumstances to say that the existence of this scheme has prevented many Australian farmers from going bankrupt as a result of the impact of the drought. I take this opportunity to record my continuing appreciation of the work of the former Deputy Prime Minister and member for Gwydir when he occupied the primary industry portfolio in advocating and securing cabinet support for the establishment of the farm management scheme, which in my view has been one of the most beneficial agricultural schemes introduced by any government in this country over the last 25 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. Of course, the member for Riverina represents the heart of the rice-growing area of Australia and knows as well as anyone how the drought is impacting on our farmers, particularly the accessibility of a secure water supply to our irrigators. It is interesting to note that just 0.5 per cent of agricultural land in Australia is irrigated but it produces 25 per cent of total agricultural output, a lot of that coming from the member for Riverina's electorate in the Murrumbidgee.The drought will dramatically affect irrigation this year, including our valuable horticulture, rice and dairy production industries, because of that lack of access to secure water. In New South Wales, in the Murray, the lower Darling and Lachlan, irrigators have zero allocation. In the Murrumbidgee there is just 18 per cent at this stage of the season, so they only have access to 18 per cent of their allocation of water. Water allocations in Victoria's food bowl in the Goulburn Valley are just 21 per cent, with only a 10 per cent chance of any increase in that at all by the end of this season. It paints a very bleak picture for the irrigators, who produce, as I said, 25 per cent of our agricultural output.The broader community should be concerned by and aware of - and they are, across Australia - what is happening with drought and what is happening with the shortage of water. For example, people in the cities experiencing water shortages are understanding what a drought is all about. As was indicated in a press release by the National Farmers Federation, Charles Burke said it would be short-sighted to dismiss drought as just a problem for farmers. It critically impacts on our farming community, but it is an issue that the nation needs to be able to deal with.Now - and the member for Riverina would be aware of this - our irrigators are always being blamed for the ills of our river systems, but it is not always the case. The reason that we will not be planting any rice this year is because it has not rained. The reason that the rivers are not flowing is because it has not rained. So there will be no rice crop grown because it has not rained, not because they are taking too much water out of the rivers.As the Prime Minister has just indicated, this government has never shirked its responsibilities of standing by Australia's farmers and supporting them in times of adversity. Since 2001 we have spent $1.2 billion assisting 53,000 Australians families. So we will continue to do our bit, but the financial institutions and the banks in Australia should also be sympathetic to the circumstances of Australia's farmers. Today I have written to the major banks and the financial institutions asking them to be sympathetic to the problems of their farming clients and to do their best to provide help and assistance where they can during this drought, not just in the interests of agriculture or regional communities but in the interests of the nation.</DOC>

 - I have read those media reports. If anybody has been forced to sign a contract which signs away or purports to sign away that person's right to join a union then that is illegal and those responsible should be prosecuted. It has long been the position of this side of politics that the right to belong or not to belong to a union should be sacrosanct. It has never really been the policy of the Labor Party that the right not to belong to a union is sacrosanct. I mean, you cannot be a Labor member of parliament without belonging to a union, so do not come into this place and start giving us a lecture about freedom of association.The 457 visa system has brought forth one of the most spectacular contemporary examples of Labor Party double standards and Labor Party hypocrisy. In here every day in the parliament they are up on their feet saying these 457 visas are an outrage. They are saying that every day, yet behind the scenes, away from the glare of the national parliament, their Labor mates at a state level are falling over themselves to recruit -  -  - Oh, yes they are! You ought to go home to Western Australia and find out what the Western Australian government is doing. It is begging the minister for immigration to grant more 457 visas. The biggest single user of 457 visas is the New South Wales health department. The last time I checked, unfortunately New South Wales still had a Labor government and has had a Labor government now for nine or 10 years. So I simply say to those who sit opposite: do not parade your hypocrisy on this issue. You are being utterly opportunistic. You do not care about the human rights of migrants; you are just interested in a cheap political point of no substance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform the House that, after the final budget outcome for the financial year 2005-06, I announced that the government would be allocating a further $13.6 billion into the Future Fund, which will join the $18 billion already allocated, bringing the sum standing to the Future Fund at over $30 billion. This will make a major contribution to funding the liabilities of the federal government in relation to superannuation.The liability of the federal government for superannuation currently stands at around $97 billion or $98 billion. This liability has never been funded in the history of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth always left the situation to be paid out of future revenues. It was not until this government cleared net debt that we were able to set up a Future Fund, which is now well on its way towards matching that liability with $30 billion, as I said, and also over the next two years we would expect proceeds from Telstra. We would be 30 or 40 per cent of the way towards funding that liability. This is absolutely critical at a time when the population is going to be ageing, when the number of people over 65 compared to the working age population is going to double and when we are going to have all of the costs of increased health care and pharmaceutical benefits. To have cleared net debt and begin building a Future Fund will set Australia up for that great challenge.Australia's efforts in this regard have been recognised by the IMF, with the IMF managing director recently saying:... with the establishment of the Future Fund ... Australia is well placed to face the challenge of ageing population ...We have also had this recognised by the OECD, which said:The explicit quarantining of the Future Fund separately from other medium-term objectives is laudable and will make an important contribution to pre-funding the fiscal costs of ageing its own employees.There is still one thing that concerns the government about the Future Fund - and it ought to concern every taxpayer - and it is this: the Leader of the Opposition, because he cannot pay for the promises that he is out there making as he runs around Australia, is very directly threatening to raid the Future Fund - to raid the provision for Australia's future, to raid superannuation - for his own political objectives. He has been up in the Northern Star setting out his priorities. Have a listen to this:Federal Labor's plans for improving the Pacific Highway ... depends on plans to commandeer Treasurer Peter Costello's 'Future Fund'.That is what it says. So here we are - not only do we have to fund the future and clear the debt but now we have to actually raise the money to pay for the Leader of the Opposition's promises as well. - Last time the Leader of the Opposition was in a financial portfolio, he promised that he would balance the budget - and the budget was a $10 billion deficit. He is like a bear with a honey pot. He cannot keep his paws off the money which belongs to the taxpayers of Australia. Labor would never have had the wit to set up a Future Fund. It would not have the wit to defend it. - It would not have the wit to fund superannuation and it ought to keep its hands off the savings of the Australian taxpayer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and I acknowledge her successful efforts -  - To secure an after-hours GP clinic at Nepean Hospital funded by the federal government. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the most important components of Australia's health system. I should point out to the benefit of members that, to a considerable extent, improvements in life expectancy from 70 years at birth 45 years ago to over 80 years at birth today are due to effective drugs available to all Australians under the PBS. To protect taxpayers as well as to benefit patients, drugs only go on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme if they can satisfy rigorous cost-effectiveness tests administered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.I know many Australians were delighted when on 1 October a number of new and innovative drugs were listed on the PBS. First of all, Herceptin has been listed for HER2 positive women with early stage breast cancer, and that was listed after an expedited approval process. It is estimated that this will boost breast cancer survival rates, currently 85 per cent for the affected patient group, to about 90 per cent. Secondly, the drugs Lantus and Levemir have been listed for patients with diabetes, and these certainly should help them to better manage their condition. Finally, people with cardiac risk factors will be able to access statins on the PBS regardless of their cholesterol level. All up, these very significant changes will benefit more than 360,000 Australians and they will cost more than $860 million over the forward estimates period. - All this shows - we've got more sound effects from the member for Lalor - no policy whatsoever -  - just a constant whingeing and whining from the member for Lalor, constant whingeing and whining from a person who is completely bereft of any policies or any ideas as to how to deal with the health problems of the Australian people. What all of this demonstrates is that the Howard government will not hesitate -  - to invest the money needed to make a good system even better. The Howard government has yet again demonstrated its clear credentials as the best friend that Medicare has ever had - and doesn't the member for Lalor hate that!</DOC>

 - The member for Watson asks effectively: can I give a guarantee that all abuses are being reported? No, I can't - nobody can - anymore than I can give a guarantee that a law we pass or a law any government passes is fully implemented and anymore than a minister in a New South Wales or any government can give a guarantee that every law in that state is fully obeyed and every abuse is reported. Of course I cannot.What I can do is adopt a common-sense approach to this issue. I am glad that the member for Watson asked me that question because this morning in his doorstop he said in relation to 457s: 'You can't scrap them; you need to have a system of temporary work visas.' -  - Yes, we do; that is right. We have established that point. We have now established the point that we need to have a system. - We have also established that the greatest users of 457s are state Labor governments. They love them. The proposition that they are being used as a tool to drive down wages is palpable nonsense. In fact, the wage requirements in relation to 457s, if you look at them carefully, directly refute that argument.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Indeed, I am aware of reports in today's Herald Sun that the Bracks Labor government is wasting $32 million of Victorian taxpayers' money on a settlement as a result of disruptive union activity. This project, the Southern Cross station in Melbourne, was due to be completed more than 18 months ago and what we have seen there is a project which has experienced delays and, indeed, cost blow-outs. This was a direct result of union activity on the site which saw the union shop stewards controlling everything. To quote from the report, 'You could not do anything unless you had the consent of the stewards to run your program - everything from ordering concrete trucks to the induction of new employees.'There has been no industry in Australia in greater need of a comprehensive clean-up than the building industry. After years of unlawful and corrupt conduct, the government's reforms are delivering opportunity in a new era which is characterised by efficiency and legality rather than the unlawfulness and corruption of the past. The national rate of disputation has fallen to the lowest levels in Australia, indeed, in the building and construction industry alone. When the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister in Australia - the last time he had some responsibility for some aspect of the economy in Australia - the number of working days lost in this country was 104 per thousand employees. What we have seen in the latest set of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics is a figure of just three - three working days lost per thousand employees. So when this man was responsible, 104 working days lost per thousand employees; today, just three. That is an indication of the success of these reforms which the government has put in place.I am asked by the member for Deakin if there are threats. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has opposed all of these reforms to the building construction industry in Australia. Why: because he is beholden to his union masters. He gets directions from them every morning. He was quoted in a doorstop in September as saying:I speak with the _ trade union leadership on a daily basis.They tell him what he should do about this. If given the opportunity, the Leader of the Opposition would rip up these laws to the building construction industry, would drive up disputes in Australia again and would effectively drive up the cost of housing affordability in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for the opportunity to speak in response to the questions that he has asked about the use of 457 visas. In relation to the specific questions, some of them may require further information, which I will obtain, but I can say that I understand that one in five 457 visa holders, as he has suggested - I think the figure is 19 per cent - is often able to seek from within Australia a skilled migration outcome on the basis of the skills that they have and on the basis that they satisfy the relevant criteria for a permanent visa outcome. Whether that would lead to two million workers in Australia by the year 2011 is something I would have to check, but, with of the order of 100,000 migrants settling in Australia each year now, one can see how figures of at least half that may well be ascertainable.In relation to the 457 visa class generally, it was introduced as a result of a report commissioned by a predecessor of mine, former immigration minister Nick Bolkus. The report was prepared by a very distinguished businessman, Neville Roach, and formed the basis of the implementation of the 457 visa class. It has been a system which, from time to time, may be manipulated or misused by some people, but in the main it has been extraordinarily successful. If you look at the number of complaints in relation to the 457 visa class, you will see that something in the order of 200 employers out of 10,000 employers in the program in the period up to September 2006 have been the subject of complaints. In relation to that, DIMA has been doing its job of monitoring the compliance of that program. It has monitored something like 6,471 sponsors and has made site visits to 1,790 sponsors. If you look at the implementation of the program, each time issues are raised about the scheme being potentially misused - and each time issues are raised in this parliament - you will see that DIMA is conscientiously investigating the small number of cases involved.In relation to the member's allegation that these are visas for people who are working in relatively low-paid employment in Australia, 85 per cent of persons granted 457 visas in 2005-06 were professionals, managers or associate professionals. The largest single occupation has been that of nurses. When you look at the employment demands within our economy, it is not surprising that we need to have an important and well managed program for administering the capacity of the Australian economy to be able to function effectively.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest. We have received reports today that the fugitive Julian Moti arrived in the Solomon Islands from Papua New Guinea early today. He is currently being held in a police station in the Solomon Islands in relation to immigration offences.Mr Moti is an Australian citizen, and the Solomon Islands Prime Minister wants to appoint this Australian as the Attorney-General of the Solomon Islands. I make the point that Mr Moti is facing child sex charges here in Australia. That is a very serious allegation, and we would expect Mr Moti to be sent back to Australia to face those charges. We feel very strongly about this, and I am sure that all members of the House would agree with me. This is a very serious matter.The circumstances of Mr Moti's flight from Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands are also worrying. A spokesman for the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare, has confirmed that a Papua New Guinea military plane was used to transfer Mr Moti, who was wanted by authorities in Papua New Guinea. So, on the face of it, this action was in complete contradiction to Papua New Guinea law. He had no passport and he had been apprehended and taken before a Papua New Guinea court, and he was expected to appear before a Papua New Guinea court.This whole situation goes to the very heart of what this government has argued for a long time: there are serious problems with governance in some parts of the Pacific and there are serious problems with the upholding of the rule of law in some parts of the Pacific. The taxpayers of this country are spending over $300 million a year to help the people of Papua New Guinea. We have spent around $800 million of taxpayers' money on the RAMSI initiative to help the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands, and the people of those countries, as well as our own taxpayers, deserve to see higher and improving standards of governance in those countries. That is a very important requirement that this government lays down in its relations with these countries.We will investigate further the circumstances of Mr Moti's flight from Papua New Guinea to the Solomon Islands. I understand that when Mr Moti landed in the Solomon Islands, the ordinary people of the town he landed in apprehended him and took him to the police. So the ordinary people of the Solomon Islands know what is right and what is wrong. These are good and decent people in the Solomon Islands, and they deserve a good and decent government.We regard the charges that Mr Moti faces as very serious charges. It is important for the work of Australia that politicians in our region behave responsibly, that they respect the processes and their own legal systems, and that they do the right thing by the people of their country. This is a matter for law enforcement authorities and the courts. This is not a matter for politicians.</DOC>

 - My understanding in relation to the Hilton case is that the Office of Workplace Services investigated claims raised in the media regarding accusations of duress being applied to workers in the sale of the Hilton IGA in Perth in September. Yesterday the OWS announced that it would be prosecuting Ten Talents Pty Ltd for allegedly applying duress to existing employees.Provisions in the Workplace Relations Act prevent employees having duress applied to force them to sign an AWA. The transmission of business provisions ensures that an existing worker's entitlements are protected for 12 months, as the government said they would be last year. In this case a complaint was made, it was investigated by the OWS and in 18 days action was taken against an alleged brief.So much for the law not working! The law has worked with alacrity, to the great disappointment of the member for Perth. I know it breaks the heart of the Labor Party when this law is demonstrated to be working effectively. As I will demonstrate at the end of question time when I add to an answer I gave yesterday, the member for Perth is a past master at distorting the situation on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to report to the House that last month Australia's exports totalled something over $18 billion - the second highest figure on record. It is particularly pleasing to note the strong growth in our export performance. As a result, our trade deficit was just $208 million for the month - down $112 million on the previous month.The most impressive and pleasing aspect of our export reforms in the month is that, despite the claims of the opposition that our export performance was faltering and was only being held up as a result of the commodities boom, the facts show that these claims are completely false. In reality, commodity exports for the month were flat - actually down slightly at $6.1 billion. The real growth that occurred was in other areas, such as the manufacturing sector, which the Labor Party always says is in crisis. It in fact had an increase to $3.7 billion. The service sector also produced $3.7 billion worth of exports. It is also pleasing to note that the figures for education have been significantly upgraded. Again, Labor says that our policies are failing, but the reality is that education is on the verge of becoming a $10 billion a year export industry. That is a significantly important employer and provides an opportunity for Australia to spread our export industry around the world.So the reality is that there has been a substantial growth in our manufactured exports, our service exports and in education. I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield, in particular, would be pleased to note the substantial increase in car exports in the previous month - up 37 per cent in a month. There was a 37 per cent increase in car exports and over 60,000 vehicles will be exported this financial year. In 2005-06 car exports reached a record $5.2 billion. So our manufacturers, our service sectors and our educators are getting on with the job of exports and helping to improve Australia's trading situation.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Fremantle: the design and intent of that provision of the legislation is very clear. I cannot guarantee the individual conduct of either employers or employees in response to a provision of the law, any more than I am sure the member for Fremantle purported to guarantee the behaviour of people in relation to laws passed when she was Premier of Western Australia or when she was a minister in the Keating government. The truth is that you legislate for a purpose and people are expected to obey the law. If they do not obey the law, they get prosecuted. That is happening with alacrity - and I know it upsets you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and his very strong commitment to the very large defence contingent in Townsville. Late last month the first 18 of the 59 Abrams M1A1 tanks that Australia has purchased arrived in Australia. They arrived at a cost of $528 million and six months ahead of schedule. In recognising the importance of the Abrams tanks to Australia, I pay tribute to the late Captain Paul Lawton, who died from medical causes in the process of escorting the tanks to Australia from Baltimore. Captain Lawton gave 16 years of his life to the Australian Army as an engineer, and we thank him for that.The Abrams tanks are a very important part of Australia's and this government's endeavours to harden and network the Australian Army. They will significantly increase the mobility, the firepower and the integration of the Australian Army's protective weaponry with its infantry. These tanks are also essential to the protection of the lives of Australian soldiers. I point out to the House that in the last 24 hours in Iraq there was a significant engagement between the Iraqi army and the US army. There were 30 insurgents killed in that engagement. A rocket-propelled grenade hit an Abrams tank. The tank was extensively damaged but not a single American soldier was killed.There have been criticisms of the acquisition of the tanks, a number of them quite misinformed. The first is about whether the tanks will be transported easily throughout Australia. They weigh 62 tonnes. Once they are on the heavy tank transporters, they will weigh, in total, 97 tonnes. The government is in the process of acquiring the heavy rolling stock which will transfer them from Adelaide to Darwin by rail. The next 41 tanks will arrive in Darwin in April. In addition to that, they will go along precisely the same roads and across the same bridges in the Northern Territory as do the Leopard tanks which are currently used by the Australian Army.The Executive Director of the Australia Defence Association, Mr Neil James, in his August-September Defence Brief, said this of the tank acquisition:The shrill claims about the supposed unsuitability of the 59 new Abrams tanks being bought to replace our 105 Leopard mark Is have relied on several fibs and enough straw men to build arguments around a haystack. Contrary to common but inaccurate claims, the tanks are not too heavy or otherwise tactically unsuitable to deploy in our region. Based on the Army's wartime operational experiences in operating tanks in New Guinea, Bougainville, Borneo and Vietnam, the tanks are needed to save infantry lives in the complex terrain of our region's sprawling urban areas and jungles.The reality is that these tanks will enable the Australian Army to hit harder and it will be harder to hit. The reality is that over the 30 years that we have had our Leopard tanks they have not had to fire a shot in anger. Let us hope that over the next 30 years these Abrams tanks will also not have to fire a shot in anger - but the world we face and the way it is changing and the insecurity we face to our country and our region are such that I fear I may be wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. The region that he represents has suffered from bushfires over many years, with not only the loss of property but the tragic loss of life in the Ash Wednesday fires and in other bushfires. I am informed that already the Dandenong national park is a tinderbox. As in many regions throughout Australia, the fire risk will be extreme in the coming fire season.Without a doubt, Australia is facing one of its most serious bushfire seasons for many years. The Australian government stands ready to respond to this threat with more than $30 million in disaster mitigation funding in this year alone. Included in this funding is some $15 million over three years for the Bushfire Mitigation Program, a very important program which enables the construction, upgrading and signposting of fire trails, something that is very important to the thousands of volunteers who are out there fighting bushfires and protecting lives and property. Without those bushfire trails, those volunteers could be placed at risk and they could not have access to those fires. To date, some 1,644 projects have been funded under this program.I want to pay tribute to the thousands of men and women who volunteer their time every single summer to protect the lives and properties of people around Australia from bushfires. To further assist those volunteers in the protection of lives and property, the Howard government is also providing some $5.5 million towards the National Aerial Firefighting Centre to ensure that once again this summer we will see sky cranes like Elvis and many fixed-wing aircraft available and ready to respond immediately to fire emergencies throughout this country.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to prepare our homes and property against bushfire threat. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General and his department have provided some $2 million for a national awareness campaign and already this information is being broadcast nationwide. In conclusion: the Howard government will continue to assist communities around Australia in their relentless fight against the bushfire menace this summer and in years to come.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. I think there are many people who would take exception to her continued denigration of the American education system. It has no place in Australian politics.The fact is that 96 per cent of Australian domestic undergraduates attend university in a Commonwealth-supported place - 96 per cent. Three per cent - nearly four per cent - of students attend in a full fee paying place. At least a third of them are in relation to winter school or summer school. And so we are talking about a very small proportion of students who are given the opportunity to pay a full fee in order to attend university. The opposition think it is okay for students from Malaysia or China to have an opportunity to attend university and pay for a place, but they would deny the same opportunity to a very small number of Australian students, who deserve to have an opportunity -  - The full fee paying places are offered in our most competitive courses, and Australian domestic students should have every right, as other students from overseas have, to undertake a university course. Ninety-six per cent are in a Commonwealth-supported place, and a fraction of that are in a full fee paying place. This is all about choice for Australian students.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden; the House recognises his expertise in the area of foreign affairs, and I appreciate his interest.Let me begin by saying that there have been rumours this morning of a second test conducted by the North Koreans. We have no confirmation of that. Indeed, there seems to be some confusion between the possible seismic activity from a test and seismic activity from an earthquake that took place off the coast of Japan, but this is still being investigated. Having said that, we remain very concerned about the possibility of a second test and a second test happening in the near future. Of course, if that were to happen then that would only double the resolve of the Security Council to proceed with the sanctions regime that they are looking at.On the Security Council, we are pleased that the Security Council has condemned the announcement that the test of a weapon had taken place on Monday. I might say that I have been particularly encouraged by China's response, which has been strong. They have said that North Korea must face some punitive action for its nuclear test. The United States and Japan have proposed to the Security Council a draft resolution under chapter 7 - and we think there should be a chapter 7 resolution - and that would include a series of sanctions in relation in particular to trade in military and luxury goods as well as dual-use technologies, and also to authorise the inspection of cargoes moving into and out of North Korea.Let me make one point: the people who have suffered the most from this policy over recent times have been the ordinary people of North Korea. They are the saddest victims of the policy of the North Korea government - oppressed to the extent that their human rights have been taken away from them. The people of North Korea do not have enough food to feed themselves, and yet they have a government that spends billions of dollars on nuclear weapons programs. It is a credit to the international community including, if I may say so, Australia, and a disgrace for North Korea that donor countries have continued to keep many of the people of North Korea alive.A survey done by two of the UN agencies with the North Koreans - so the North Koreans were involved in this - found that 37 per cent of young children in North Korea are chronically malnourished. The robust international response to the North Korean nuclear testing will not include imposing even greater hardship on these people by cancelling aid. Certainly, it is worth reflecting that last year Australia spent $3½ million on food aid and basic water, sanitation and health care for North Korea. We have set aside this financial year a budget of $4 million to spend on helping the ordinary people of North Korea. It is our intention, despite what the regime has done, to continue with our food aid programs and it is our intention to continue with health and sanitation programs as well. The ordinary people of North Korea have been treated abominably by their government and I think the international community should give them some support, while imposing rigorous sanctions on North Korea of a kind that will, in particular, do damage to the North Korean regime itself.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I will tell you what is hypocritical. What is hypocritical is that the Australian Labor Party are prepared to allow Australian students to study at the University of New South Wales Singapore campus - they are quite prepared to allow them to pay fees to study in Singapore; they voted for it - but then they say that a full fee paying student should not be able to do the same in Australia. This is all about choice for students. If Labor want to have a debate about lower standards then bring it on, because that is what the Australian government is committed to ensuring - that our students have a greater focus on literacy and numeracy standards. It is a disgrace that our universities are having to divert resources to remedial English classes at university. That is a failing of the state education systems.</DOC>

 - I can inform the honourable member for Canning that the progress so far under the new Work Choices legislation - and it is just over six months, so it is relatively early days - is a lot better than we were told by the Labor Party would be the case. Since Work Choices was introduced, over 117,000 AWAs have been signed. In September, over 27,000 AWAs were signed, which was a 46 per cent increase on the average uptake per month in 2005. Additionally, over 1,000 employee collective agreements have been signed since Work Choices began, covering over 48,000 employees, and there have been 800 union collective agreements signed, covering over 240,000 employees. But most important of all, despite the predictions that the world would come to an end, the sky would fall in, there would be mass sackings, wages would be slashed and generally there would be a pestilence all across the land, what has happened is that 175,000 new jobs have been created.The member for Canning asked me for my response. I think I can say that is my response - but, more importantly and more interestingly, what is the response of state Labor governments to the policy of the opposition leader to tear up workplace agreements? I know that the Premier of the state from which the member for Canning comes, Western Australia, made it very clear when he was in China with me in June of this year that he was not the least bit interested in following the Beazley policy of tearing up Australian workplace agreements. He leads the largest mining state, if I can put it that way, in the country and he knows the critical importance of Australian workplace agreements to the mining industry of Western Australia. He knows they need those workplace agreements to get maximum choice and maximum productivity.But this - how shall I put it? - recalcitrant trend amongst state Labor governments has now spread to Victoria. Yesterday, Mr Hulls, a senior minister in the Victorian government, was asked on seven occasions whether he supported the Beazley policy of tearing up AWAs, and he refused to do so. Listen to this for a disingenuous reply from a state Labor minister - a disingenuous reply. This is what he had to say. The Victorian industrial relations minister, on seven occasions, refused to endorse Mr Beazley's policy, and he included in his refusal the following words: 'Look, I haven't got exactly the quotes that Kim Beazley said, so I don't exactly know what he said.' I do not think we are in any doubt. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, went to the ALP conference in June in New South Wales and he said, 'I will tear up AWAs; I will tear up the government's workplace agreements legislation.' The truth is that Labor governments, faced with the need to cooperate with the business community of Australia, do not want a bar of the Beazley policy because they know that policy would be anathema to the future prosperity and development of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and reiterate to him and to the House that this government is committed to providing both employers and employees with the flexibility to choose suitable employment agreements for their workplaces. I was asked about any specific examples. I was interested to read last night that AAP, the news service, reported that the member for Perth was completely unaware that Martin Donnelly Electrical Services had offered its employees the choice of a collective agreement or an Australian workplace agreement.On Monday the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth went down to a construction site here in Canberra and sought to - and in fact did - publicly defame an Australian business. They did that, as was shown yesterday, without establishing the facts of the case whatsoever. They accepted the spin of their union masters in this case and launched an unwarranted attack on Australian business. - They went down there and sought to trash the reputation of an Australian business. In the last couple of days we have seen what has become the standard modus operandi of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Perth, and indeed the Australian Labor Party. On Monday when they went to this site an ETU official said to the Leader of the Opposition:The pressure is all on you. You are our skipper. We are behind you. We are behind you with the ruck. You are our front row forward.The pressure is certainly on the skipper today because unfortunately -  - for their skipper, the Leader of the Opposition, and his first mate, the member for Perth, sunk the boat yesterday. He publicly confirmed that he was unaware of the facts. You would think after yesterday's performance that the member for Perth would have the decency to come in here and fess up today. But it is worse than that, Mr Speaker. The company in question, Martin Donnelly Electrical Services, has released a very interesting statement. In part they say that Martin Donnelly Pty Ltd -  - The Leader of the Opposition just interjected and said, 'You always accept the employers rather than the employees.' In other words, he is saying to me and to the House that you just accept one side. That interjection was very interesting in the light of this statement which said that MDPL 'have on three separate occasions contacted the member for Perth, Mr Smith. Unfortunately he has not responded to our request for MDPL to present their side of the story'. What hypocrisy! - They go on to say that a spokesman for MDPL said 'they were dismayed that the member could present information in parliament as factual without an understanding of the AWA'. They also say that MDPL are a small, local, family-oriented company with a firm commitment to their employees. The irresponsible statement of the Labor Party will have a long-term effect on the viability of the company and ultimately their 43 employees' future. - They are prepared to trash the reputation of a business here in Canberra and affect the viability of the employment of 43 people in Canberra and somehow come here and pretend that they are the friend of the workers. What hypocrisy! - There is another interesting fact that, again, the member for Perth was totally unaware of. They say that it is bewildering that although the union has been 'appointed bargaining agent for several of our employees, they have not made any contact with our office to discuss any issues regarding the AWA. We believe the union is more concerned with their own survival than the wellbeing of our employees'.That is too true. So we have had the member for Perth sink the boat of his skipper yesterday. He ought to have the decency to apologise not just to this House and to the people of Australia; he ought to have the decency to apologise to this company and their 43 employees. It is no wonder - I will finish on this note - that business in Australia has no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party. They have shown through this example that they are prepared to traduce the reputation of a business and to trash business in Australia. That is economic vandalism and this man should never, ever be given an opportunity to put that into practice. - </DOC>

 - The facts completely betray the argument put by the member for Perth, and that is pretty typical in arguments put by him. The reality is that many of these employees have taken up the offer made by the company because they are up to $150 a week better off. - Keep compounding it, Stephen; just keep going, mate. You are doing a great job of burying yourself and your party on this issue. Keep going. Let us take a couple of claims that were made by the member for Perth. Let us go back to the facts and not your rhetoric. There were no guaranteed pay increases during the life of the AWA - this is what the member for Perth said; completely false, 'I don't like the facts'. - It is amazing how, having come in here yesterday, the member for Perth wanted to detail a whole series of facts to prove he was right. As soon as I raised the facts that proved he was absolutely wrong, he wanted to run away, and the Leader of the Opposition is trying to save his sinking ship. He said there was no pay increase. In fact, there was a 10 per cent pay increase over two years - 5.5 per cent in the first year and 4.5 per cent in the second year. He said that payment of overtime is at the sole discretion of the employer - again, wrong. In the conditions of employment, it says, 'Overtime will be paid for at the rate of time and a half for the first three hours and double time thereafter' - set out in black and white in the conditions of employment.He said:Under the collective agreement, there is a tool allowance of $12.50 a week.Under the current collective agreement there is a tool allowance of $12.50 per week. There is no separate tool allowance in the current collective agreement. He said, 'Under the current collective agreement, there are electrical certification allowances and ACA registration allowances payable each week.' In fact, they have only ever been payable on the occasion when the employee was qualified in that regard. So, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, and they are just four of the matters raised by the member for Perth yesterday.On the substance of the question, I go back to the statement by Martin Donnelly. He says: 'We want either a non-union agreement or an AWA. In fact, under our AWA, employees are going to be around $150 a week better off and I cannot see what people are complaining about. The workers obviously are not.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question today. The August figures on housing finance were released, which showed that housing finance commitments fell in the month of August but are 15.4 per cent higher over the course of the year. This is consistent with moderate growth overall in the housing market, although it is quite plain that in Perth the housing market is particularly strong and it is much more subdued in the eastern capitals.Also released today was the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment, which rose 3.9 per cent in October and is now 7.2 per cent above the level of a year ago. Four of the five indexes rose in October and the index has now nearly entirely recovered the huge fall that it suffered in August. It appears as if the major reason for the rise in consumer sentiment is the fall in petrol prices. The all-capital petrol price last week around Australia was 116c per litre, down from its peak in August of 136c per litre. So that is a 20c drop in the average in capital cities over the last two months.Indeed, looking at the oil price, the oil price, which overnight was $US58.50 a barrel, is some 20 per cent lower than it was in August. It might be too early to say that the oil price has peaked and stabilised, but a 20 per cent decline in the oil price over the last two months is certainly very welcome, and very welcome to Australian consumers, who are now paying in capital cities 20c a litre less than they were paying in August, and you are seeing that in consumer sentiment, which is now higher than it was this time last year. What all of this adds up to is continuing growth in the economy as a whole. We are now entering the 16th year of growth in Australia - the longest run of economic growth in Australian history. - I just heard the authentic voice of socialism interjecting: the former President of the ACTU, claiming credit for economic growth. Let me remind the parliament that 10 years ago -  - we did not talk about surplus budgets, because the budget was $10 billion in deficit. Let me say, 10 years ago we did not talk about clearing debt, because we had $96 billion of debt. - Let me tell you, 10 years ago we did not talk about unemployment rates at five per cent, because unemployment rates were up at 10 per cent. And 10 years ago the current mortgage interest rate, at 7.8 per cent, would have been considered unattainable. Let me remind the very voluble Leader of the Opposition, 'The Skipper', and his crew on Gilligan's Island over there: the member for Gellibrand, Mary Ann; The Professor, the member for Griffith. And whom will we christen Gilligan? I think the member for Lilley. He has got to be Gilligan, over on that -  -  - Mr Speaker, I was. But, anyway, as I was saying in relation to housing finance, this is consistent with a growing housing market. - I was rather distracted by the crew on Gilligan's Island over there, as the member for Menzies has christened them. - Let me say, if we were stranded on Gilligan's Island -  - under 'Skipper Beazley', we would never be where we are today.</DOC>

 - The Australian government is not afraid of a debate on education that sees a lifting of standards across the country. The point -  -  - The point that we have made is that the Australian government wants to see greater national consistency and rising standards in every school across this country. The point that I have raised is that there is a very high level of fragmentation and inconsistency in the development of school curriculum across the country -  -  -  - The focus of the Australian government is to ensure that the state education authorities are held accountable for the curriculum that they develop. We want to ensure that the highest possible standards are achieved in schools across Australia so that, wherever a child attends school in Australia, parents can have the confidence that their children are learning the essentials. That is why we are focusing on literacy and numeracy - to ensure that Australian students are given opportunities in life.The member for Charlton then left the chamber. - We want to ensure that the fads, the experiments and the political ideology are out of our schools and that we focus on the fundamentals. The Leader of the Opposition ought to be ashamed at the debacle of the outcomes based education that was implemented by the Western Australian government. This is the kind of experimentation that parents in Australia -  - The Australian government is committed to ensuring that across this country parents can have the confidence that their children are taught the fundamentals to give them a decent chance in life. We will hold the state education authorities accountable for better educational outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gwydir for his question. It was in the role as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that the member for Gwydir first flagged that there should be a study undertaken of a north-south rail corridor through the eastern states of Australia. That study was announced early in 2005 and it started in September of 2005. Ernst and Young conducted that review and Minister Truss released that study only last month. That study indicated that there are three options for a north-south rail corridor through the eastern states. It also identified the significant growth that is going to take place in the freight tasked. In fact, within that north-south corridor over the next 25 years the freight tasked is going to double. So it is going to require some significant planning in terms of being able to deal with the balance between the freight tasked on road and the freight tasked on rail.On the 25th of last month, I participated in a public meeting in Parkes - joining about 180 delegates, representing more than 20 local government areas. The forum was held to discuss the released review of the rail corridor. It expressed interest in and support for the development of a north-south rail corridor. A number of private sector operators and private sector interests have also expressed great interest in being involved in the development of a north-south corridor. Many industry players have said that publicly. Pacific National, Toll Holdings, Coles, Queensland Rail and the Australasian Railway Association have all welcomed and offered their support. Coles, for example, which reportedly transports 450 containers a week by rail, says the proposed link would help absorb an expected doubling in the eastern seaboard freight over the next decade. It should not be an either/or decision about rail; it should be about how we manage that task over the next decade.Don Telford, the CEO of Pacific National, has said that an inland rail corridor will deliver rail's long-term capacity and performance needs to handle Australia's future freight task. I can assure the House that the government is keen to listen to the expressions of interest from industry and the communities along that corridor as we press forward with the development of a strategy. Of course, this builds on the work that we have been doing with the $15 billion AusLink package that is in place and which was added to in the budget of this year. It goes without saying that it is only through strong representation in government that rural and regional Australia will get looked after by our government as far as transport infrastructure is concerned.</DOC>

 - The Australian government position has been absolutely consistent on this issue because we are about ensuring that there is greater national consistency across this country. Currently we have eight separate education authorities around the country, each separately developing separate curricula for every subject in primary and secondary schools. - I have called for a debate in order to ensure that we can achieve greater national consistency and I have said that the states should bring to the table the very best that they have to offer. So, if the New South Wales curriculum is the best in the country, let us all have a look at it and see if that can be rolled out nationally. I have suggested that representatives from the states and territories get together to discuss the best curriculum that this country can produce.I have worked with education ministers across the country to ensure that we can get consistency in statements of learning, and they are under way in five subjects. The states have now agreed that, as part of our funding agreement, there will be national assessments in literacy and numeracy for years 3, 5, 7 and 9. What we need to focus on is ensuring that every child, wherever they go to school in Australia, has access to a high-quality education, with high-quality teaching in a high-quality environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. The drought in Australia is worsening. The June quarter national accounts showed that farm GDP fell 2.3 per cent. If we had a 2.3 per cent fall in GDP generally, that would be a very, very severe recession. Severe rainfall deficiencies have extended across Australia over the past few months. The Bureau of Meteorology reported in its October statement:September 2006 saw continued below average rainfall across southern and central parts of the mainland, with deficiencies generally expanding or intensifying over South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. Furthermore, the dryness was exacerbated by temperatures that were well above normal.In response to these weather conditions, ABARE has revised its forecast and forecasts that Australia's winter crop production will fall from 40.8 million tonnes to 26 million tonnes, a 40 per cent drop in the winter crop. The largest declines in production are expected to occur in Queensland - the state of the honourable member for Maranoa - and Western Australia. That was in relation to the September quarter and to date there has been no real good news in October.There is also a human face behind the drought and the crop failures and that is the extreme pressure that farmers and farming families are under as a consequence. During the current drought, the Australian government has spent around $1.25 billion in drought assistance through exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances mean that farmers can receive relief payments, which are at the rate of the Newstart allowance, to help them meet daily living expenses. They also receive a health care card and may receive concessions under youth allowance means tests for dependent children. Eligible farmers can also receive subsidies of 50 per cent of interest costs in the first year and 18 per cent of interest costs in the second year of an EC declaration, to a maximum of $100,000 per year or $300,000 over five years.These are provisions to keep farmers going during drought periods. The government has also put in place a number of other measures under the Agriculture Advancing Australia program, including rural financial counselling, Farm Help and the Farm Management Deposit Scheme. The situation will undoubtedly detract from overall growth, although agriculture is not as large a proportion of the overall GDP as it was in previous years, but the suffering of farmers and farm families under this cannot be overestimated. The government stands ready to help them through these extremely difficult times with the programs that I have outlined.</DOC>

As far as the department is concerned, I believe - and I have always said this - that, unlike the opposition, I have not been slagging off at officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I assure her that support for private health insurance is one of the signature policies of the Howard government and, thanks to policies such as Lifetime Health Cover and the private health insurance rebate, almost nine million Australians now enjoy the security and choice afforded to them by private health insurance, including 61,000 people in the electorate of Greenway.Today we saw a rare unity ticket between the Leader of the Opposition and the woman who wants to take his job when we saw a joint press release headed up 'Only Labor will save Medibank'. What is clear is that Labor wants to keep Medibank Private in government ownership but scrap the policies that make Medibank Private work. Let us be clear about this: Medibank Private is not successful because of government ownership; Medibank Private is successful because of this government's policies - policies which members opposite are pledged to destroy.First we had the Leader of the Opposition's well-known statement that the private health insurance rebate is one of the worst pieces of public policy ever to come before the parliament. Then we had Medicare Gold, Labor's secret plan to destroy the private health insurance rebate, as revealed in The Latham Diaries. Just yesterday we had the member for Lalor endorse a report by the so-called New Matilda organisation calling for the complete abolition of the existing system of private health insurance. Yesterday this New Matilda group, headed by a former Whitlam government official, released a report calling for 'a single universal health insurer'. It went on to say, 'Private health insurance should be confined to peripheral services.' The member for Lalor immediately endorsed this report and she said that it 'correctly identified the major issues facing our health system'. I really was not surprised by the alacrity with which she endorsed the New Matilda report because I went onto the New Matilda website and I found this comment: 'I don't think Beazley will ever find his ticker because he hasn't got one.' It is no wonder that the member for Lalor is suddenly a great enthusiast for New Matilda.Labor do not just want to keep Medibank Private public; they want to nationalise the whole private health insurance system. It is quite clear: this government supports private health insurance; the opposition do not support private health insurance. There has been no repudiation of the Latham statement about Medicare Gold, there has been no unambiguous statement of support for the private health insurance rebate and a refusal to means test it. 
Opposition members - Oh, we are all Maoists! - I am not saying that; I am saying that you certainly do not support private health insurance. I have often said in this House that the Howard government is indisputably the best friend that Medicare has ever had. What is becoming even clearer than ever is that the Howard government -  - is the only friend that private health insurance has.</DOC>

 - The first thing they should be concerned about, Member for Macquarie, is that the Labor Party would have as an education minister the guest speaker at the Marxist centenary conference where she called for an end to capitalism. Remember that one, Jenny? Down with capitalism!I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and I acknowledge his deep commitment to raising standards in education across the country. The Howard government is committed to ensuring that we have high standards in education across the country. We want to see greater national consistency across the country and we want to ensure that state education authorities are held accountable for what is taught in schools so that parents can have the confidence that their children are getting the fundamentals and that the education authorities are getting the fundamentals right.I am sorry to say that they do have reason to be concerned about falling literacy and numeracy standards. Parents have a right to be concerned when universities in this country are reporting that they are having to divert resources to remedial maths and English classes for tertiary students. Parents have a right to be concerned when international benchmarking says that 30 per cent of 15-year-olds in Australia do not have an acceptable level of literacy. We have a right to be concerned when international benchmarking tells us that 12 per cent of 15-year-old students do not have fundamental mathematical literacy. These are the sorts of issues that parents are raising with us. I thank the member for his question, because we want to ensure that there is greater accountability for taxpayers, particularly parents.Parents are sick of the fads and experiments that are going on under state education authorities. I give the example of the disastrous OBE implementation in Western Australia. In Tasmania they have now trashed the Essential Learnings program. In Queensland over the weekend they announced a review of the senior syllabus. We want to see greater national consistency, and that is what we are working towards. There are eight separate curriculums in this country. There are nine separate year 12 certificates. There are five different eligible school starting ages. I will tell you who is being disadvantaged by this. The 80,000 or 90,000 students who move interstate every year are being disadvantaged by the lack of consistency in our education systems. So the Australian government is happy to have a significant debate on education to ensure that we can get states to commit to higher standards for all students in Australia.</DOC>

 - To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: the government and, I think, most Australians have the view that if you have the capacity to work you should work, and it is a fundamental principle that each and every minute of the day Australian taxpayers spend $11,280 in payments for the dole. Every minute of every hour of every day $11,280 goes out the taxpayers' door to people on the dole. When you go to country towns and speak to the workers and to businesses - to places such as Lismore, where the member for Page has made a good point about the fact that it has an unemployment rate of over eight per cent - you are told there are businesses that are crying out for skilled and unskilled workers. There is not a skills shortage in Australia; there is a labour shortage in Australia. - It is about the fact that there are more than half a million Australians on the dole and they are not applying for jobs in the way that they should be and have been in the past from time to time. We are in a glorious age where there are more jobs than workers. It is a great return to the golden era of the fifties and sixties when we had a low level of unemployment and high wages.I make this final point: the Australian government would always rather see an Australian in an Australian job than a foreigner in an Australian job. That is a fundamental point. But it is also the case that if employers cannot find someone to do a hard day's work then they have to go somewhere to get the workers. It is about the economic prosperity of the country and the economic prosperity of regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. With more than 5,000 ADF members from all three services and their families in his community and around greater Darwin he has a very particular interest in this. One of the challenges that kept emerging when we discussed with members of the ADF what would help keep them in the ADF - what would support a positive experience for them and through that support a defence capability - was the impact that service could have on their families. The new ADF Family Stability Initiative, budgeted to cost around $17 million a year, will provide ADF personnel with a new option where they may consider, at the time of being required to relocate on a posting, the opportunity for their family to maintain geographical stability while the personnel are away for part or all of their posting.This is extremely important for defence personnel who are posted to areas where there is a high anticipation of deployment, where there may be other demands or, particularly, where their children have some critical years of their schooling emerging or where their spouses or partners have established employment or housing preferences. The upheavals of having to relocate can be exacerbated by these broader family impact determinations that need to be considered by the family. Under the Family Stability Initiative, ADF personnel can choose locational stability for their families whilst they proceed to fulfil their duty and their outstanding service to the Australian Defence Force. To overcome that choice and the implications that come with it, there will be added support in the services package for accommodation and rental assistance, meals assistance, increased family reunion visits and the additional costs associated with living away from their families for part or all of their posting.Surveys of the ADF show us that this locational stability issue is a big one for our families. We may recruit a member of the ADF but to retain them we need to retain them and their families. This makes our defence enterprise a family friendly employer, it encourages military service and it encourages those keen to stay with the ADF to continue to make their contribution. It is about choice. It is about flexibility. We will always be reminding families that separation for whatever period is a difficult choice, but it is an option that needs to be considered, when broader family priorities are recognised by the family and the member, as something they wish to accommodate.This initiative is just one of a range of things the government is canvassing. The Minister for Defence is doing a terrific job pursuing retention and recruitment initiatives. I say to anybody listening to this broadcast today: consider the delicious world of career opportunities within Defence - it is a fulfilling, meaningful and worthwhile way of using your working life. This is one of the measures that make that an easier, more supportive and choice-rich environment in which people can pursue that career.</DOC>

It seems as though it is always a case of: when the Labor Party raise a particular issue in this place and when we delve into the facts we find that they do not speak the truth. I and the government make no apology for trying to find work for Australian workers. We make no apology for Work Choices because, in the 199 days since Work Choices started, wages are up, jobs are up and industrial disputation is at its lowest level since 1913. So we make no apologies for the industrial changes. They represent good news for Australian workers right across the country.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and for his strong support for small business in his electorate. I am very pleased to advise the House that Australia is the second easiest country in the OECD in which to start up a business, to obtain credit and to hire workers. This information has come about through a recent report by the World Bank called Doing business in 2007. For someone wanting to start up a business in Australia it only takes two steps and two days. That compares with the average in the OECD of six steps over 16 days. That is very good for Australian small businesses. This has not happened by accident. This has happened because the Howard government has made it much easier for people to do business in Australia. We have done that by maintaining a very strong economy, by cutting taxes, by cutting red tape and by increasing the flexibility in the workplace. Since Work Choices has been introduced, 175,000 new jobs have been created.The member for Grey asked me if there are any threats to this business environment. Sadly, I do have to advise the House that there are real threats to this environment. The Leader of the Opposition is proudly going around the country telling people how he will reintroduce unfair dismissal, the scourge of small business across this country. He intends to force small businesses to go back to that system of having to pay go-away money. He is going to rip up the AWAs. Let me remind the House that it is no accident that the Leader of the Opposition reaffirms that for as long as he sits in that chair the ALP, as he has very proudly proclaimed on a number of occasions, is not the party of small business. Every day he reaffirms that.</DOC>

 - I know what has happened under my watch: unemployment has fallen to a 30-year low. I know what has also happened under my watch: the battling workers of Australia have higher wages than they ever had under a Labor government. I know that this has happened on my watch: the strength of the Australian economy is greater than it has ever been at any time since the end of World War II. The problem with the figure relied upon by the Leader of the Opposition is that it does not include the vast majority of vocational and technical education expenditure in this country, but just university expenditure. It shows the single-tracked obsession of this Labor Party with university education. The only thing that matters to a Labor member of parliament is a university education. They have forgotten the value of technical education, and when you add all of the figures together, public expenditure on higher education is expected, by 2007, to be at $8.2 billion, which is an increase of 26 per cent since 1995.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can inform him that the labour force figures released today for the month of September show that in the month of September 31,400 new jobs were created. That is about 1,000 jobs a day throughout the whole of the month. As a consequence of that, unemployment has fallen to a 30-year low of 4.8 per cent. In the electorate of Bass the unemployment rate today is 5.5 per cent, compared with the unemployment rate in 1996 of 9.9 per cent. So it is nearly half of what it was 10 years ago.The good news is that over the last year there have been 271,000 new jobs created in Australia, and under this government, since March 1996, there have been 1,966,000 new jobs created in Australia. The other good news is that the participation rate - that is, the rate of people of the working age population who are in work or looking for work - has now reached an all-time record high of 65.1 per cent. In other words, there is a record participation rate, a record number of jobs and a 30-year low in unemployment.Since the Work Choices reforms were introduced in March of this year 205,000 new jobs have been added to the Australian economy. We do not say that they were all added as a consequence of Work Choices because obviously economic growth has a lot to do with this. But we can say one thing: the claim by the Labor Party that Work Choices would be job destroying - that was the claim - was wrong for 205,000 reasons since March of this year.The strength of the labour market also underpins the need for flexibility. Nothing would be more damaging - where you have a 30-year low, where you have some parts of the economy that are very strong on the back of mining and commodity prices and where you have other parts of the economy which are being brutally kicked around by drought, such as the agricultural area - and nothing could be more wrong than to have wage fixing that took wage settlements out of profitable areas of the economy and applied them back to those areas of the economy which are not doing so well.Nothing could be more destroying in terms of inflation, in terms of economic growth and in terms of jobs. That is why Labor is so wrong in opposing Work Choices. It is why the ACTU is so wrong in putting forward its orders for battle for the ALP today of getting rid of AWAs and returning to centralised wage fixation. That is what gave us the problem back in the early eighties and the early nineties. One of the reasons we have been able to maintain this in a low-inflation economy is that we have much better industrial relations, and nothing threatens that more than the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Apart from the fact that I happen to think that just being over 25 or over 30 is still pretty young, and in fact I think a much higher age than that is still pretty young, I would counsel - not a word I normally use; it is a bit too politically correct for me - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about introducing ageism into this debate. I think that is a very unwise thing to do. You ask about 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds. I will give you 403,600 responses to what this government has done for that age cohort, because that is the number of apprentices now in training, which is a 161 per cent increase since March 1996. I might also remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the principal beneficiaries of the 25 Australian technical colleges - in fact really the only beneficiaries of those - are young Australians in years 11 and 12 and, the last time I checked, most Australians in years 11 and 12 were well under the age of 25.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question and I acknowledge his deep interest in this area. The $837 million Skills for the Future package, which was announced by the Prime Minister today, includes funding of $56 million over four years for 500 new engineering places at universities across Australia. These places will commence in 2008. These engineering places are going to contribute significantly to building our engineering capability and will add to the 65,000 students who are currently studying engineering and related technologies.The 500 new Commonwealth supported places are in addition to the 510 new engineering places that I announced in July and they will commence in 2007, so over the next two years, 2007 and 2008, there will be 1,010 new engineering places, which will substantially improve the capacity of the higher education sector to deliver high-quality engineering courses in this country. That is going to support development of our infrastructure through to our high-technology industries and take full advantage of the mining and resources boom that is supporting our economy and driving our economic wealth.I will be writing to Australian universities to seek proposals for the 500 new engineering places, and this underscores just how important the Skills for the Future package is. It will deliver more opportunities for Australians and it will continue to drive our innovation and global competitiveness with a productive workforce.</DOC>

 - The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is that the 'only' to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers is well in excess of double the number of people who now enter mature age apprenticeships. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sneers at the fact that there are only 10,000. I might remind her that, if she is talking about 'onlys', there were only 122,000 apprentices when her leader was Minister for Employment, Education and Training.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay. The government of the state she comes from is not meeting its obligations in the partnership the Commonwealth has with the Australian states on the whole area of vocational and technical education. In particular, in that state of New South Wales, TAFE fees have increased by 150 per cent and 200 per cent in some courses. In fact, even the Australian Education Union in their recent TAFE Futures report have acknowledged that young people are being pushed out of the education system by those TAFE fee increases in New South Wales. We have seen fee increases there to $1,700. I say to the member for Lindsay: keep up the work that you are doing to fight for your constituents on this front.The Prime Minister today announced a boost of $837 million over five years, which will add to an already record-setting level of expenditure by an Australian government in the area of vocational and technical education. There has never been a government in Australia's history that has spent as much money as this government is now spending and, in fact, even before today's announcement, was spending on the area of vocational and technical education. The results are already in, with 403,600 people entering the training system as apprentices this year and 1.7 million people in the training system around the country.The $408 million in work skills vouchers will give an opportunity to 30,000 people each year to access those vouchers in a way that in fact trusts them to make their own choices and make it work for them. It makes certain that eligible adults aged above 25 years who have not reached a year 12 outcome or a certificate II outcome or the elementary elements of vocational training can enrol in accredited literacy and numeracy courses so that they have an opportunity to make good their ambition and experience, to realise something for themselves and to take on the opportunity to participate even more fully than they might have already in Australia's economy.The $306.7 million support for mid-career apprentices will help up to 10,000 apprentices aged 30 and above each year who in fact are in the workforce, who have been there and done that but do not have the piece of paper to prove their ability, to get that piece of paper. It backs the employers as well as the employees in the decision to invest in those people to train. These sorts of initiatives are going to make an enormous difference. These sorts of initiatives are going to add to this record level of funding: the $156.8 million already in the system on support services for employers and Australian apprentices through the Australian apprenticeship centres; the $28.2 million in the $800 toolkit allowance - an allowance that Labor cannot guarantee and that could be under threat if there was ever a change of government but which came in as a result of this government focusing on young people and, in fact, all people in the training system - and the $571 million in the 2006-07 financial year alone for financial incentives to employers to back their decision on the margins to make a difference for their business by investing in their people. Today's package is going to produce enormous dividends and continue the strong economic circumstance of this country.</DOC>

 - This government put in place monetary policy and inflation targeting and it was totally opposed by the Labor Party, which threatened to sue on the grounds that it was illegal. I do notice that the Labor Party has given up that policy and has not yet served the writ that it promised 10 years ago. The monetary policy that we have put in place has been very successful, with inflation averaging 2.6 per cent over the course of the last 10 years. Indeed, it has been so successful that the Labor Party now says that it wants to adopt coalition policy on monetary policy, which we welcome.In relation to future prospects for inflation, we believe we can continue to meet our targeting notwithstanding the fact that the Australian economy is experiencing unemployment lower than it has had for the last 30 years. But to do that we have to make sure that wage settlements from profitable parts of the economy are not transported into unprofitable parts of the economy. There is nothing wrong with an increase in wages in a profitable mining company where it is meeting a world price and boosting supplies. There is nothing wrong with that at all. In fact, the employees have the right to share in the profitability.What is wrong is if you try to take a wage settlement out of a mining company - say, for an electrician or something - and apply it to a manufacturing company in one of the big cities, where there is not such an opportunity for profit. If you do that, you harm profitability and you harm employment. This is what happened with the breakout under the metal award in 1981. It is what happened in relation to the inflationary pressures that were in the economy in the late 1980s which led to extremely high interest rates. Under a much better industrial relations system we can handle that. We can maintain our targets in relation to inflation and we can maintain the Australian economy in a much stronger position than it has been in in the last 30 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Of course, the member for Kalgoorlie clearly understands the current strength of the Australian economy and so much of that strength is coming out of his electorate, particularly from the mining and resource sector. That sector is doing more than its bit to push unemployment down in Australia, where we have got a national unemployment figure of 4.8 per cent - much lower in Western Australia; I think about 3.7 per cent, as a result of what is going on in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate.But, of course, the mining sector is also generating a lot of the demand for skills in Australia. It does not matter whether they are people from Western Australia or across the broader nation. The package announced today - Skills for the Future; $837 million - is adding to measures that we already have put in place to upskill the country beginning at the high school level, as the Prime Minister indicated, through the Australian technical colleges and year 11 and year 12. It will link those young people with industries that need those skills in the future and lead them into the workplace.It is interesting to note, and the member for Kalgoorlie would recognise this, that the other advantage of this package is in terms of upskilling workers already in the workforce - people who might be working in some of the areas along the eastern seaboard in a particular trade that want to upskill so they can direct their skills into the mining and resources sector in Western Australia. The assistance that is provided in this package will help deliver extra workers into the areas of need where they can take advantage of the prosperity that is being generated by the mining sector in particular.This is all part of a focus and a very clear direction the government is giving as far as the Australian economy is concerned. Since 1996, 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the economy - 205,000 since Work Choices was introduced earlier this year; 205,000 since the sky was supposed to fall on the Australian economy. It has not fallen; it has gone in the other direction - real wages growth of 16.4 per cent.We need to compare those sorts of statistics - the level of unemployment in Australia - against what it was in the early to mid-nineties. We all remember when the Labor Party was in office running the Working Nation program - where unemployment was, what was happening with skills and what was going on in the economy - and it is vastly different now. We will continue to introduce policies that are right for the time and that will deliver the skills that are needed in Australian industry to continue to secure the prosperity of the nation, particularly in areas of major growth and need like the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate in Western Australia.</DOC>

 - Of course, I have seen the speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last night. I note in passing that of course the member for Lilley has sought to misrepresent it. He did not say anything about skills in his speech last night. It did not stop old Gilligan over there running around and claiming that he did. In relation to inflation, we had 1.6 per cent -  - Come on, Skip! With a skipper like that, it is a wonder the rest of the cast could get in the boat! But in relation to the CPI -  - We all know who he is talking about: the member for Brand, affectionately known as 'Skip' around the parliament. In relation to the CPI, the two largest elements for the June quarter were in relation to fruit and vegetables and petrol. Of 1.6 per cent movement in that particular quarter about one per cent was made up of those two items. Ex of those two items, you had a CPI of about 0.6 per cent. But, under the agreement that the government has put in place with the Reserve Bank, the agreement that the Labor Party opposed and wanted to sue the government for entering, we will be looking at underlying inflation over the course of the cycle. What we will do is look through one-off factors which we believe will pass through the system such as the effects of cyclones and oil prices. We are looking for underlying inflation - that is, inflation in general goods and services. Obviously, petrol will have delivered some pressure as a second round effect in relation to those and, obviously, commodity prices will have delivered some second round pressure in relation to those. It is the key second round, underlying or general price movements that are the focus of activity under the agreement between the government and the bank. That is what we focus on. It is made clear by the governor, it is made clear by me and it is made clear by the agreement between the two of us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gwydir for his question. No-one knows more of the devastation and loss from prolonged drought that affects individual families, rural economies and rural economic and social life than the member for Gwydir. Many members on this side of the House know it too. All of us appreciate that this is now the worst drought on record and it has required an unprecedented response from the government. Since 2001, and before then, a number of regions have been going in and out of drought and across the board there has been no normal seasonal rain since 1995. We have provided over $1.2 billion to more than 53,000 farmers and their families. The Commonwealth government pays 100 per cent of income support and 90 per cent of interest rate subsidies. The government is spending $29 million a month on that income support and interest rate subsidies.The government is continually monitoring its drought assistance measures. At the request of the Prime Minister, I have undertaken a series of consultations with the National Farmers Federation, farm organisations and rural community groups and representatives in order to make sure our assistance is targeted as properly as possible. These issues are currently under consideration.Earlier this week, we heard from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer, all of whom are well aware of the dire circumstance our farmers and rural communities are facing. However, this must be news to those opposite, because yesterday on ABC Country Hour the opposition agricultural spokesman, in an attempt to exploit the fears and uncertainties of farming families, said, 'Only 13 per cent of farmers have ever accessed these particular provisions.' That is a deliberate and calculated deception. Fifty three thousand farmers do not add up to 13 per cent of the farming community, as the shadow minister said when he misled and deceived the Australian public. To exploit the misery of drought would have to be the lowest act anybody associated with agriculture could ever engage in.In the member for Gwydir's electorate, up to 57 per cent of farmers in the Bourke-Brewarrina area have accessed assistance. In the member for Riverina's electorate, 80 per cent of eligible farmers have accessed assistance. In the Goulburn-Loddon area, the member for Murray's area, 75 per cent of farmers have accessed assistance. Today in the member for Parkes's electorate, 45 per cent of farmers in the western division are currently accessing exceptional circumstances.The opposition claims serve no other purpose than to strike fear into people who are vulnerable and exposed. It is playing politics with drought. And I should say that the member for Corio has never asked me a question as shadow minister for agriculture, either in this House or in writing. He has never issued a press release. I have checked the Hansard and he has never raised drought. The only comment from him on this that any of us can locate is in yesterday's ABC transcript in which he, quite frankly, lied to the Australian people about only 13 per cent of farmers receiving drought assistance. - I withdraw. But people will make their own judgements about the honourable member's integrity. - I had some sympathy for the position the member for Corio finds himself in, but not anymore - now that he exploits the fears of farming families. - I will say again to the House that I withdraw. But anybody who heard that knows full well the deception the member for Corio engaged in. - </DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Second, I would like to say that the government of Japan informed us last night that it was going to take a number of very strong measures in response to North Korea's nuclear test. We appreciate the fact that our friends in Japan have notified us of their actions. The measures include a ban on port calls in Japan by all North Korean vessels, a ban on the importation of all North Korean goods and a ban on the entry into Japan of all North Korean nationals apart from some special cases, such as on humanitarian grounds.The Australian government welcomes Japan's strong measures, and we encourage the international community to consider the measures that Japan has taken and, where it is relevant and where possible, to take similar or at least proportional steps. Japan's response, like our own, takes care to avoid imposing additional pain on the long-suffering ordinary people of North Korea. The Japanese, though, have shown considerable leadership here, and I think it is important that Australia recognises that.Let me just say in conclusion that the United Nations Security Council are still considering sanctions, and we hope that they will come to a conclusion - and that it will be a strong and effective conclusion - fairly soon. But of course there will be the whole question of enforcement. There are a number of North Korean ships in the Asia-Pacific region; it is only reasonable that all of us would want to know whether those ships were carrying dual-use technologies or technologies that could be used for North Korea's defence machine - its nuclear component or its missile component in particular. Under the Proliferation Security Initiative, we will be continuing to look for ways - of course, within the bounds of international law - to intercept ships and to be able to inspect ships where the ships themselves may be suspicious or their cargos may be suspicious.But I think all of this throws a good deal of light on the issue of the Proliferation Security Initiative. I do not think it has a terribly catchy name, but it is a way of reinforcing in very practical terms the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and the non-proliferation regime in relation to other weapons of mass destruction. I think in relation to North Korea this has the potential to be a particular test of its effectiveness, but I am sure it will live up to expectations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I note that in his state of Victoria the unemployment rate, according to the latest ABS statistics, has fallen to 4.5 per cent. Indeed, the 205,000 jobs created in Australia since Work Choices is almost three times the number of jobs created over the same six-month period on average in the last 20 years.In October last year the Leader of the Opposition committed to releasing his workplace relations blueprint in the first six months of this year. He said:In the first half of next year, we're planning to set down our blueprint for an industrial relations framework _Mr Speaker, until today, the Leader of the Opposition had been waiting at the altar for his union masters to come along and deliver the blueprint. Mr Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, has now released his blueprint to run the country. I say that advisedly, because in June Mr Combet said:I recall we used to run the country and it would not be a bad thing if we did again.And how does Mr Combet want to run the country? First of all, as the member for Corangamite pointed out in his question, what Mr Combet wants to do in his blueprint is to force employers to reveal the financial details of their businesses. Secondly, he wants to prevent businesses from making any workplace decision without union approval, right down to the working methods used within a businesses. So what we have, if Mr Combet gets his way, is a return to the bad old days when the union shop stewards and the union bosses controlled every hour of every day of every worker in Australia. That is what Mr Combet's blueprint for Australia is.As a result of this, we now have a quite clear choice: a government which is committed to providing freedom of choice for employers and employees or an opposition dictated to by the union movement in Australia, which, on their own words, is dedicated to denying people choice in this country.Let us make no mistake about what this plan is. This is a plan for strikes. This is a plan for slashing jobs. This is a plan for lowering wages in Australia. What Mr Combet has released today is a threat to the jobs of all Australians. If there was any gumption from the Leader of the Opposition - who still has not released his blueprint - he should immediately condemn Mr Combet's plan. He should immediately condemn it as the job-destroying plan that it is. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, should publicly tear up this recipe for economic vandalism. But of course he will not do this. We know he will not do this, because, at the end of the day, what we see is a sinking skipper with his bumbling boatload, who are incapable of running Gilligan's island, let alone the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Griffith has taken out of context many of my statements in relation to these issues over the years. In fact, he produced a document - with 10 ignored warnings et cetera - which includes only five words in inverted commas. The rest are in a context invented by him. The reality is that the Cole commission has been established to investigate serious allegations that have been made about the AWB. Those allegations -  - The Cole commission will soon deliver its findings, and that will be an appropriate time to make a judgement about what actions have been appropriate and what actions have not been appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and the interest that she shows in the issue. The Prime Minister has spoken about the anniversary already. I add that the Australian consul-general has organised a memorial service in Bali for today which was attended by Ambassador Bill Farmer, our ambassador to Indonesia. Nineteen representatives of the victims' families and survivors travelled from Australia for today's ceremony.Since the Bali bombing, there has been extraordinarily effective cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in the area of counterterrorism. The House would understand that we cannot talk about it in great detail. Nevertheless, the work that has been done by the Australian Federal Police, Australian intelligence agencies and elements of our defence forces alongside their Indonesian counterparts - combined with the diplomatic relationship - has been extraordinarily important in countering terrorism. Australia and Indonesia co-hosted the Bali Regional Ministerial Meeting on Counter-Terrorism. Australia and Indonesia have not only cooperated very closely but also done more than that: we have led the way in building regional cooperation in the area of counterterrorism.I am not sure if the Leader of the Opposition was referring to terrorism as a whole or terrorism in South-East Asia in his remarks, so I might not be doing him justice. But I thought that he was suggesting that Jemaah Islamiah had got stronger since the time of the Bali bombing. I do not think that that would be our assessment. The Indonesians, with the support of the Americans, us and others, have done a very good job in addressing the issue of Jemaah Islamiah. It certainly would not be the Indonesian assessment that Jemaah Islamiah has got stronger in that time.Indonesia has tried and convicted over 160 people for terrorism related crimes. Six people have been sentenced to death. It is important that this is understood: three of the six who have been sentenced to death are people who were directly involved in the 2002 Bali bombing. Sometimes you hear people say that the Indonesians have let Abu Bakar Bashir get off. The fact is, they have sentenced to death three people who were directly involved in those Bali bombings. There are eight people serving life sentences, and a further 23 serving sentences of 10 or more years.It is important that we in this country understand that the Indonesians have been doing a very good job in countering terrorism. They have been doing a very effective job, and they are very committed. This is not easy. The politics of handling this issue in Indonesia are, as some in the House would understand, completely different from the politics of handling that issue in a country like this. It is a totally different environment. In spite of that, President Yudhoyono, his ministers and officials have addressed this issue very robustly. Having said all of that, I would not go as far as my predecessor, Gareth Evans, went a year or so ago when he said that Jemaah Islamiah was pretty much out of business. I would be a little less optimistic than that. There is still a problem. There is still an active network of jihadists in Indonesia and in South-East Asia. But a lot has been done to address that issue.Finally, when it comes to advocacy for moderate Islam, it has to be said that that is not something that gets much publicity here in Australia. But the Indonesian government has been doing a very good job. Nothing is more effective in terms of the advocacy for moderation in relation to Islam than advocacy coming from Muslims and Muslim governments. The Indonesian government is very focused on that. We would like to congratulate them for the work that they have done despite the difficulties that they face and, frankly, will continue to face.</DOC>

 - It is not wise to ever take what the honourable member for Griffith says on face value. For instance, he asked me a question just before about what I said on 15 January this year. I have just checked my diary, and I was travelling between Hong Kong and Manila on that day, so it is fairly unlikely that I said what he quoted. - I was travelling between Hong Kong and Manila on that day, so I did not make those statements on that day. He also chooses to take out of context what I said at the National Party conference in Emerald in March this year. Let me make it absolutely clear that in that speech I went to great lengths to emphasise that Australia expects high standards of our businesspeople when they operate overseas. Right at the beginning of that speech I said, 'We have high business standards and ethics in Australia and even if they are not shared in other parts of the world that does not mean that we should compromise our standards.' I made it abundantly clear that I expect high standards of Australian businesses. - I commented later that there had been an effort on the part of some to confuse the word 'commission' with bribery and corruption and I said that the idea that you could cross out the word 'commission' and write in 'bribery' or 'kickbacks' as though the words are interchangeable is completely unacceptable. Let me make it absolutely clear: I condemned bribery; I condemned kickbacks; I condemned corruption. Commissions are a reasonable part of business activity. I expect all Australian businesses, including the Australian Wheat Board, to behave responsibly and according to Australian law.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question, and I acknowledge in particular the work he has done as a doctor on public health issues, particularly in places like East Timor. Australia is recognised as a world leader in pandemic preparedness. So far the government has committed some $600 million towards, amongst other things, building up one of the world's largest antiviral stockpiles and helping to improve surveillance and treatment capacity in our region.Exercise Cumpston, which will begin on Monday, will be Australia's largest ever health simulation exercise. It will help test our border control, disease detection and surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine and treatment systems. It will also test our decision-making structures, our coordination mechanisms and our communications strategy. One feature of the exercise will be the arrival at Brisbane Airport on Tuesday of a plane carrying at least one person infected with pandemic flu. This exercise will run over four days, it will cost more than $4 million, it will involve more than 1,000 Commonwealth and state officials and other health personnel and it will be attended by 55 foreign observers. This exercise will help to demonstrate that you can trust the Howard government with the security of Australia. You can trust the government to handle health security and biosecurity as well as other national security issues.</DOC>

 - I responded to that question in anticipation in my last answer. The reality is that it is not uncommon in business in Australia and around the world to pay commissions. We pay commissions to people, as I mentioned, when we buy or sell a house and when we buy or sell insurance. Farmers pay commission frequently when they sell their grain to an agent, whose job is to connect the supplier with the market. In those circumstances, that is a reasonable fee for service.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his ongoing interest in the affairs of Aboriginal Australians, particularly in the Northern Territory. As every member of this House is aware, it has been a very high priority of this government to address the criminal activity that has been occurring in many remote parts of Australia, particularly in Indigenous communities. As such, we committed to a $130 million package at the June summit, which was subsequently committed to and signed off by all the state and territory premiers and chief ministers with the Prime Minister at COAG.As part of that, we have extended the Central Australia Substance Abuse Intelligence Desk for another 12 months. It has been indicting drugs that have been going to remote communities and destroying young people's lives. We have also put in a place a sniffer dog team. There is one in Darwin and there will now be one permanently based in Alice Springs. In addition, in a recent visit to Alice Springs, I was unfortunately informed by Northern Territory police officers there that, whilst looking after this very large, remote area, they had no vehicles supplied to them by the Northern Territory Police - which came as somewhat of a surprise. Even though dismayed, I undertook through our department to fund those vehicles immediately so that they could do their work. I have written to the Territory government asking them to, obviously, pick up a necessary component of policing, that being vehicles, throughout the Northern Territory.Yesterday I announced the appointment of an independent auditor of remote Indigenous communities so that we can better ascertain the real policing needs for those communities, and that person is Mr John Valentin. He is the former Deputy Commissioner for the Northern Territory Police. His appointment has been welcomed by the Australian Police Association, as it has been by many others. His task over the next three months will be to determine what policing levels are needed to ensure the safety and security that most of us enjoy, and all of us deserve, in our communities. It will help us to be able to determine, with state and territory governments, where the $40 million that we have allocated to new police stations and new police houses will be used, so that it is on the best advice that these communities can enjoy a safer future and these young Aboriginal people can have the same sort of future that the rest of us expect throughout Australia.</DOC>

 - I think it is fair to say that freedom of choice is a golden thread that runs through the policies of the coalition. Of all the freedoms to which this side of politics is strongly committed, none is more important than the freedom of a man or a woman in this country to join or not to join a trade union. We believe that if you want to join a union you should be able to do so without penalty, but if you do not want to join a union you should be able to stay out of the union without penalty.We had an emphatic reminder at the weekend that the Labor Party does not embrace that principle. We saw in South Australia yesterday a vision of the world to come a la Greg Combet, when he said it was about time the unions resumed running Australia. We saw the South Australian state conference of the ALP refuse two journalists admission to the conference because they did not belong to a union. We had the explanation of the 'no ticket, no start' rule from the new senior vice-president of the ALP and Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, when he said, 'If you joined the union you would be allowed in.'Not only was the Leader of the Opposition forced into the humiliation of having a news conference in a park because he could not have the news conference in the conference hall but then some of the delegates got up and tried to reverse the policy, and the motion to reverse the policy was defeated on the floor of the conference. The image of the Leader of the Opposition in that park gave me a smidgen of a reminder of one of the most famous photographs in Australian political history, and that was Arthur Calwell and Gough Whitlam outside the Kingston Hotel in 1963 wanting to get instructions from the faceless men - and they were all men then - of the Australian Labor Party as to whether or not our American allies could establish a communications station in the North West Cape in Western Australia.The Leader of the Opposition pathetically bowed to a ban on the right of people to join or not to join a union. Instead of saying to the ALP conference in South Australia, 'You change this stupid rule in the name of freedom of choice,' he pathetically went along with it. When he was asked about it, he said, 'It's really got nothing to do with me; it's got everything to do with the state conference.' Here is a man who wants to be the Prime Minister of Australia but who cannot say boo to the South Australian ALP. I think it is a pathetic example of exactly what life would be like under a future Labor government. Greg Combet said it all when he said, 'The unions used to run Australia and it wouldn't be a bad idea if they did again.' It is pretty clear that the unions run the Leader of the Opposition. It is our job to make sure they do not end up running Australia.</DOC>

 - The government made its position in relation to the MRET very clear when it brought out its energy white paper. It is the view of the government that many contributions need to be made to solving the problem of global warming. Renewable energy is part of the solution, but another very important part of the solution is nuclear power. Until those on the other side who spruik their commitment to solving the problem of global warming admit that one of the things that needs to be looked at very seriously is in fact the possible contribution of nuclear power, I would invite the member for Grayndler -  - The government acknowledge, and we always have, that renewables are part of the response; but so are other energy sources. The point I would make to the member for Grayndler is the point I would make to all of those who sit opposite: if you are really serious about tackling the problem of global warming, you have got to be serious about looking at the potential contribution of all of the energy sources, including nuclear power.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question, and I can tell him that the government believes that industrial relations reform is absolutely critical to Australia's economic future. One of the most significant reforms which the government has introduced is the reform which gives each and every worker the right to join, and the right not to join, a trade union. Both rights are protected in legislation under the policies of this government.The proportion of people in the private sector who exercised their right to join a union at August 2000 was 17 per cent. Seventeen per cent of workers in the private sector had exercised their right to join a trade union. The proportion of Labor MPs in this House who are members of trade unions is 100 per cent - every single one of them - because you cannot sit as a Labor MP until you have joined the particular union that you are eligible to join.On the weekend, we saw one of Labor's policies put into practice at the South Australian Labor conference: the notorious Labor policy of 'no ticket, no start'. If you were not a member of the journalists union, if you did not have a ticket, you were not allowed to get into the ALP conference in South Australia. This had the effect of banning journalists who had exercised their freedom of choice not to join a union from getting in and covering the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. As we have just heard from the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition had to go across to a park to address the journalists who did not have a ticket and had therefore been banned from the ALP conference.Just in case you thought this was some one-off from the South Australian Labor conference, this morning Labor frontbenchers were asked on their way into parliament what they think about this policy. According to AAP, Labor MPs arriving at Parliament House were confronted by a media pack demanding to know why non-union reporters were banned. First in for the morning was Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson. He was asked whether he supported 'no ticket, no start' and he said, 'I'd have to make inquiries about that. The first I've heard about it is you raising it with me this morning.'The next person in was Julia Gillard, and she was asked whether she agreed with 'no ticket, no start.' She said, 'It's a South Australian branch conference; therefore the South Australian branch sets the rules.' It was as if she was saying, 'It's got nothing to do with me - it's all South Australia!' The next one in was Mr Kevin Rudd, who said, 'I've just got off a plane from Brisbane and I'm not fully aware of the issue. I'd rather be briefed on what's gone on.' The next one in was Anthony Albanese. - The next one in was the member for Grayndler, Mr Anthony Albanese. Mr Albanese said that he was ignorant of what had happened in South Australia on the weekend. I then went looking for the person who does a doorstop every single morning - old Gilligan over there. I went looking for others who do doorstops every single day, and I could not find them. I went through the transcript, I looked for their views, and then I went back to the AAP report, which said this: 'A number of Labor frontbenchers who usually appear at the morning doorstop were nowhere to be seen today.' So we had four out of four who did not know anything about it, the others were nowhere to be seen, and the Leader of the Opposition was doing his doorstop out in the park - just in case somebody on the doors this morning did not have a ticket.If you were in any doubt as to what the Labor Party's policy is, you saw it in South Australia. It is 'no ticket, no start', and because the Leader of the Opposition will not stand up to it, for him it is 'no ticker, no start' in relation to these matters.</DOC>

 - I stand by all the statements I have made in the past. I stand by all the remarks I have made and, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I draw attention to a statement made by the member for Griffith, the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, when addressing the Zionist Council of Victoria. - The member for Griffith, the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, had this to say to the State Zionist Council annual assembly -  - In addressing the State Zionist Council on 15 October, the member for Griffith had this to say. -  - He had this to say, amongst other things:First and foremost: Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer. - Second, and this is the member for Griffith on 15 October 2002 -  - Bear in mind he is addressing the State Zionist Council in Victoria. He had this to say:In other words, the debate then was not about the possession of weapons of mass destruction; the debate was about what should be done. - I have been asked a question about the intelligence available to me. That is a matter that I answered fully questions on, and my position has not altered. There was intelligence available justifying the decision we took. The debate three years ago was not about the possession or the accuracy of the intelligence; the debate was about what should be done in the light of Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction. The government and the opposition were at one in believing Saddam had those weapons. We disagreed about what the response would be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. In answering it I note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in Bass was 9.9 per cent. Today the unemployment rate in Bass is 5.5 per cent. Indeed what we have seen in the last six months throughout Australia since the introduction of Work Choices is the creation of 205,000 jobs in Australia - 184,000 of those jobs being full-time jobs, which is great news for Australian workers and their families. I was asked by the member for Bass whether there were any threats to the workplace reforms. We heard earlier in question time the policy of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party of 'no ticket, no start'. The Leader of the Opposition's policies were being dictated to him, once again, over the weekend by the union bosses in Australia.There are other examples, of course, of this. Recently the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, addressed the National Press Club, at which he let the cat out of the bag, stating that collective bargaining under Labor would not rely on a majority of employees wanting it. After that we had the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition twisting and contorting things, trying to say this in different ways - that perhaps you require a majority of members in the workplace in order to have this draconian policy put in place.Last week the ACTU released their blueprint. What it did was reconfirm that collective bargaining under Labor would not rely on a majority of employees wanting it. So a number of employees could march into a business as part of this policy and require the opening up of the books of account of the business and demand a union collective agreement whether or not that was the choice of the majority of workers in the business. As the Treasurer pointed out, every morning we see the member for Lilley and the member for Swan out on a doorstop. They were missing this morning. This is the day that will go down in parliamentary history as the morning on which the roosters failed to crow, because neither of them was there.Unlike the member for Griffith or Mr Thomson, the member for Wills - who were simply ignorant about this policy - the member for Perth and the member for Lilley obviously knew about this policy and, therefore, were taking their marching orders from the ACTU. They were not prepared to turn up to a doorstop in case some of the ladies and gentleman of the media were not members of the relevant union.When the Leader of the Opposition was asked in the park about this particular 'no ticket , no start' policy, his weak and incipient response was, 'We stand shoulder to shoulder with the union movement in our struggle on industrial relations.' I know banning journalists from the ALP conference is serious, but this has a serious implication for every business in Australia. The serious implication is compulsory union collective agreements, opening up the books of account, if the Leader of the Opposition were to ever lead a government in Australia. It heralds a return to the closed shop in Australia. It is union rights over the rights of the individual. A return to 'no ticket, no start' is a return to compulsory unionism.</DOC>

 - I said a range of things and so did those who sit opposite. I will return to the speech made by the member for Griffith because it is apposite to this very debate. - He said:This person, Saddam Hussein is no Sunday school, Sabbath school teacher. This is a seriously evil dude. Let us not pretend he is anything other -  - The member for Griffith said:Three years ago it was the belief of the government, based on intelligence assessments, that Saddam did possess weapons of mass destruction. That was the belief and that was the belief of our coalition partners. It was also my belief, articulated in the major speeches I made at the time, that we should -  - always take into account our close alliance and friendship with the United States in determining our attitude on these matters. I also drew very heavily to attention the evil character of the Saddam Hussein regime. I do not resile in any way from the decision the government took three years ago, nor will I be reluctant in reminding this House that if the advice of the Labor Party had been followed Saddam would still be brutalising Iraq. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and recognise that some of the safest agricultural parts of Australia are currently being affected by the severity of the drought that has beset the country, including parts of the member for Corangamite's area of responsibility. As he indicated, the northern parts of Corangamite are normally associated with lush green pastures and now they are not. I understand that these are the worst conditions in that area of his electorate since 1967 and, of course, the terribly hot days last week have just about ended any prospect of a reasonable spring.A lot of focus and attention is being given to the plight and the circumstances of the working families, the farming families, in the rural areas of Australia that are suffering from drought at the moment. It is important that all Australians understand that the average farmer can work all year and pay their mortgage, their kids' school fees and all their bills and, at the end of that, there is no salary, no cash flow and nowhere to go. It was pleasing this morning that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced the extension of exceptional circumstances assistance until March 2008 to give a lot of the people in those parts of Australia confidence, knowing that the government is going to stand beside them and look after them and their interests as they go through this very difficult time.The member for Corangamite asked about financial institutions and banks. Last week I wrote to the major banks and financial institutions across Australia asking that they be considerate and sympathetic towards the circumstances of a lot of their clients as they confront this severe drought. The response has been very positive. In fact, I managed to speak to the representatives of some of those banks at a conference here in Canberra over the weekend. They have already taken pre-emptive action in contacting their clients and getting them to understand how to best communicate their problems to their banking institutions at an early stage.During the course of the conference, I had the opportunity of meeting personally with a couple of them and talking about how we can best assist them in that process. Incidentally, I know the member for Corangamite, with his interest in industrial relations, will be pleased to know that at this particular conference all the media were welcome to participate in every session. In fact, the conference was held at the National Press Club so that we could ensure that there was plenty of media participation in and coverage of all the debate and the discussion that took place at the conference. It is important that the member for Corangamite reminds farmers in his electorate to talk to their financial institutions when problems begin to grow, so that they can try and nip them in the bud, find mechanisms to address them and help manage the farmers through those problems.</DOC>

 - It was quite obvious that the oil for food program was shamefully rorted by Saddam Hussein's regime. It is also obvious that, if Saddam's regime had not been overthrown, we would never have got to the bottom of the rorting of the oil for food program. It is also the case that the only government in the world that has had the courage to establish a proper inquiry -  - The only government in the world that faced the full impact of having a proper royal commission style inquiry into the oil for food scandal is the government that I lead. I am precluded from saying anything about the processes of the royal commission until the royal commissioner brings down his findings on 24 November. Then we will know the considered findings by Mr Terence Cole, a very eminent Australian lawyer. But until then I am not going to comment on what he may or may not find. But I will say this: the government I lead is the only government in the world that established a full, transparent inquiry. It is the only government in the world whose ministers appeared and answered questions under oath. It is the only government in the world that has had the courage and fortitude to face a proper inquiry. I am very proud of the way the government has responded to the findings of the Volcker inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I think it is the second question he has asked me about North Korea, and I appreciate his interest. The government welcomes the unanimous passage of Security Council resolution 1718, which was passed over the weekend. It is a very positive and significant step that the Security Council should unanimously take such strong action against North Korea in the wake of the nuclear test by the North Korean regime. This is a Security Council which includes China and Russia. China of course, in particular historically, has been very close to North Korea. Around half of all North Korea's trade is with China and about 80 per cent of its aid and its energy comes from China. So there is a very deep relationship there, also born out of history. Yet China was prepared to go along with this tough resolution, a resolution that imposes measures, under chapter VII, which are binding on all members.There will be a ban on the exports of North Korean arms related material. There will be a ban on North Korea's imports of similar kinds of material and material related to missile programs as well. There will be a freeze on transactions of individuals and identities who have been involved in North Korea's WMD activities. The UN members are also being called on to take cooperative action - consistent, of course, with international law - including through inspection of cargo.In terms of Australia's direct involvement in the inspection of North Korean cargo, this is a matter that we will be discussing with our friends and our allies once the United Nations Security Council sanctions committee has been established. But it is worth saying that the Proliferation Security Initiative, which this government has strongly supported from the outset and which now embraces something like 60 different countries, offers a very good framework within which inspections can take place, though of course those inspections will have to be fully consistent with international law.I add that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and I have agreed today that we will introduce in Australia a ban on North Korean vessels visiting Australian ports, except in the most dire of emergencies. I think this is appropriate. Members may recall a few years ago the so-called Pong Su incident, where a North Korean vessel unloaded large quantities of heroin on the Victorian coast. That vessel was eventually apprehended by the Royal Australian Navy and sunk by the Royal Australian Air Force. So the experience we have had of North Korean vessels visiting our shores is an unhappy one. If we are to ban North Korean vessels from visiting Australian ports, then I think that will help Australia make a quite clear contribution to the United Nations sanctions regime.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and his very strong commitment to the Australian Army, in particular in Townsville. In the last year the Howard government has announced that an additional $11 billion will be invested over the next 10 years alone in putting another 4,000 soldiers into the Australian Army - two more battalions and 1,500 more soldiers for hardening and networking our army to protect our country and our interests, not only on our borders and in our region but also throughout the world.Very shortly the government will be undertaking major reform of the recruiting process to the Australian Defence Force. There will be significant increases to the funding for the marketing of Defence careers and of wearing the Australian uniform, major reforms to the way in which we go about recruiting young and not so young Australians to the Australian Defence Force and changes to the way in which Defence careers are managed. One of the gaps we have at the moment is that we have 25,000 young Australians who have joined the Australian Defence Force Cadets. If we could have the Labor state governments be more enthusiastic about it, we could have more cadet units in Australian schools. We also have 51,000 Australians who are serving in our three services and another 20,000 reservists. But at the moment there are 34,000 young Australians who, having finished year 12, go off for a gap year. Those young Australians do a variety of things. They work in itinerant jobs, they go overseas and work as nannies or coach rugby teams, they do a whole variety of things, including aid projects - all of which is very good - but one of the things that is not currently open to them is the opportunity to wear the uniform of the Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force or Royal Australian Navy, and to do so for a year.The government, commencing in 2008, will offer up to 1,000 places for young Australians to undertake basic training in Army, Navy or Air Force and then to have further training and service experience in a limited way for the remainder of that year. We will then offer financial and other incentives to those young Australians to continue their service or, alternatively, to come back to Defence within a five-year period.It is also important to appreciate that the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and other employers are looking for the very skills that are provided by service in the Australian military - commitment and courage and integrity and teamwork, access to new and emerging technologies, and all of the things that are important for self-discipline and for team leadership. It is very important to appreciate that not only is it a part of what will be a large suite of measures for recruiting into the Australian military but also it is about building character in young Australians and exposing more of them and their families to Australian Defence Force life. The member for Dawson might be interested to know that when I was reading the Daily Mercury this morning I noticed a quote from Corporal Cadet Phillip Matthews, who is 14. Phillip is a member of the cadet unit in Mackay. He said he would look forward to taking up the opportunity himself in four years. He said:I think the Army teaches you strong morals and good discipline.All I can say is that you are right, Phillip, it builds character, and anything that is good for young people and good for Defence is great for Australia.</DOC>

 - There were a range of views available to the government, and those views were exposed by the inquiries that were conducted, and those inquiries demonstrated a number of things.

 - I do thank the member for Forde for her question and I note that October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast cancer is still the most common invasive cancer affecting Australian women, with about 13,000 new diagnoses expected in the coming year. I regret to say that new diagnoses of breast cancer have increased quite significantly over the last two decades, from about 5,000 a year then to 13,000 a year now, but it is not all bad news. The five-year survival rate for people with breast cancer has increased from 71 per cent two decades ago to 86 per cent today. Today Australian women have a one in 56 chance of dying of breast cancer compared with a one in 43 chance two decades ago, and Australia's breast cancer mortality rate is significantly better than those applying in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.Since the year 2000, this government has invested some $55 million in breast cancer research through the National Health and Medical Research Council. As most members would by now be aware, on 1 October the government listed Herceptin for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer, and this will increase the survival rates of women who qualify for the treatment by about one-third. Since 1995 the government has provided some $34 million to the National Breast Cancer Centre. The NBCC has played an important role in coordinating breast cancer research, in helping to develop clinical guidelines and in raising awareness of this disease in the community. I congratulate the National Breast Cancer Centre on its work, particularly the role of the Chair of the National Breast Cancer Centre for the last decade, Janet McDonald, who is now retiring.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition: Sir Richard Dannatt said a number of things. He also said:We all want to get out, but until there is a sufficiently stable environment to allow democracy to flourish we can't.I agree with him. The question in October 2006 that both the government and the opposition have got to appropriately answer is simply this: what would happen if the coalition left Iraq now? Would that be a boost for terrorism or would it be a defeat for terrorism? It would be a boost for terrorism. Would it be likely to promote democracy in Iraq? It would be likely to promote further chaos in Iraq. Would it be a defeat for the terrorists? No, it would be a victory for the terrorists. It would be an enormous boost for the jihadist cause all over the world. The jihadists would cheer. They would say: 'We have beaten the Americans. We have beaten the British. We have beaten the West. We have beaten the coalition. Let us go on and carry our cause to the four corners of the earth.' I cannot think of anything more calculated to give the terrorists a boost than the cut-and-run defeatist philosophy of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin. The member for Hunter said, 'Don't forget Singleton,' because he wants to see more at the Australian technical college in the Hunter. We already have record numbers of people starting in the Hunter for next year. The member for Hunter's intervention is interesting because in Newcastle and in Maitland enrolments are brimming - it is almost oversubscribed. We are going to do some work in Singleton to make sure that people in that area get the opportunity.To the member for Deakin: at Ringwood Secondary College we are going to see at least 180 students next year starting at the Australian technical college that we established there. Indeed, in Deakin we have already seen a 149 per cent increase in the number of apprenticeships - from 1,090 in 1996 to 2,710 people right now training in apprenticeships.This government has spent more money than any other government in Australia's history on dealing with matters relating to skills and vocational trades. The Australian technical colleges are a key initiative in dealing with skills needs for Australian industry. It will create a new tradition, where the sense of reward for effort for years 11 and 12 students will be re-established. Five colleges are already open and $343.6 million will be spent over the program time. In the operational year of 2007 there will be at least 20 colleges operating, with over 2,000 students at those 20 colleges.By every measure, the Australian technical colleges program is not just on track; it is in fact ahead of the program time allowed for it because the remaining colleges will open in 2008 - well within the program guidelines. Nineteen funding agreements have already been signed. We are currently negotiating funding agreements with the other four regions.This government has spent more money when it comes to vocational and technical education than any other Australian government in this nation's history. All we need is for the state governments to actually realise that it is a partnership between the Commonwealth and the states that will make a difference. Even before the Skills for the Future announcement by the Prime Minister last week, we had such things as the $43.7 million to support Australian apprentices in the form of a living away from home allowance - never under Labor, but only under this government; the Commonwealth trade learning scholarship - never under Labor, but under this government; and the $28.2 million for the Tools for your Trade initiative for Australian apprentices - never under Labor, but under this government. We had 403,600 Australian apprentices in training up to the March quarter 2006. That is a 161 per cent increase since the coalition was elected in 1996. Apprenticeship completions are up 361 per cent -  - Yes, traditional trades are 28 per cent of all Australian apprenticeships. In fact, we have come a long way. The member for Batman gives me an opportunity to make the point -  - that we have come a long way since the member for Brand was the minister in charge of training in 1993, when the numbers were down to just a pathetic 122,000.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and also for her strong advocacy in ensuring that greenhouse gas emissions are lowered while at the same time protecting economic growth. When it comes to greenhouse policy, this government has the balance right between emissions reduction and economic growth. Consider for example our $500 million investment in the Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund and our $100 million energy fund announced as part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate - a global partnership which particularly involves countries like India and China. As well as that, there is the $75 million Solar Cities program, which recently saw both Adelaide and Townsville announced as the nation's first solar city hosts - a signal of real determination from this government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through technology. These initiatives are all part of the government's $1.9 billion strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - a strategy which unashamedly focuses on technology to deliver real and economically sustainable greenhouse gas solutions.Of course, any discussion on low-emission technology cannot ignore nuclear power. Across the world, nuclear power accounts for 16 per cent of the energy produced and it is already saving, in CO emissions, some 2.4 billion tonnes every year. The government believe Australia is ready for a debate on nuclear energy - a debate based on facts, not fear. We are looking forward to seeing the results from the PM's task force on this very matter. While the government works towards practical solutions for greenhouse challenges, those opposite show they are not up to the task. - They hide behind their ideology. They do not have the courage to come out and debate the energy issue. They think that by signing Kyoto and putting taxes on Australians they will solve the greenhouse gas emission issue. They will not. Under the reign of Kyoto, emissions globally will increase by 40 per cent. What is needed is technological solutions. Imposing carbon taxes, as the Labor Party proposes, will simply export Australian industry and jobs to countries not bound by greenhouse targets. Labor is simply not prepared to do the hard work or make the difficult decisions to find the real answers to climate change concerns. By contrast, this government gets on with the job, taking a world-leading role in developing lasting technological solutions to the greenhouse challenge.</DOC>

 - I totally reject the claim that is implicit in the Leader of the Opposition's question. As I told the Leader of the Opposition in reply to an earlier question, at the time we decided to join the United States and the United Kingdom in the coalition operation in Iraq in 2003, we believed, as did the shadow spokesman, the member for Griffith, that it was an empirical fact that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that this country was a terrorist target long before the coalition operation in Iraq. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition of the words that were in Samudra's laptop on 13 October 2002 before the attack that claimed the lives of 88 Australians in Bali. This is what Samudra said:As long as Coalition forces do not leave Afghanistan, there will continue to be casualties from your countries, wherever they may be.Thus spoke the words of somebody convicted of involvement in the attack that claimed 88 lives.Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting, on the basis of that, that we should leave Afghanistan? Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that the foreign policy of this country should be dictated by terrorists? - It remains the belief of the government that if we were to precipitantly withdraw from Iraq there would be every justification morally for the United States and the United Kingdom to do the same thing. If all the coalition forces leave Iraq, that would be an enormous victory for terrorism, not only in the Middle East but around the world. That is the reason why we believe that we should remain there until we are satisfied that the Iraqi forces have a capacity to provide adequate security in that country, standing on their own. - I say simply to the Leader of the Opposition that if his policies had been followed, if his entreaties had been listened to three years ago, Saddam would still be ruling in Baghdad; he would still be financing Palestinians to carry out suicide bombing attacks against the Israeli - The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - The decision that we took was the right decision based on the intelligence available to us at the time.</DOC>

 - As I said in answer to a question without notice I was asked yesterday, choice is a golden thread that runs through the policies of the Liberal and National parties. It is not a golden thread that runs through either the policies or the practices of the Australian Labor Party, as we were reminded of in such an absurd fashion in South Australia at the weekend. Let me say in answer to the member for Blair that under Work Choices there is enormous choice available to Australian employers and employees. Let me illustrate this: since Work Choices began, over 400,000 people, in a little over six months, have entered into Work Choices agreements. Some of them are AWAs, some of them are non-union collective agreements and some of them are union collective agreements.I regrettably have to inform the House that, if Labor were to win the next election, that choice would disappear. There would be two hammer blows struck against choice by a Labor government. The first is that, under Labor's compulsory union collective bargaining policy, the choice for people to stand out and have AWAs would disappear. -  - There are laughs from the frontbench of the opposition. Are they seriously disputing that it is the policy of the Labor Party to abolish Australian workplace agreements? It is the central pillar of the Australian Labor Party's assault on the choice that now exists in the Australian workplace.Above the compulsory union collective bargaining policy, if Labor are elected, they will also allow so-called union bargaining fees. This is where unions can insert clauses into collective agreements which force all non-union members to pay for the privilege of being covered by that agreement. This is compulsory unionism by stealth, and, if the Labor Party pretend that they are not in favour of this, let me remind them that prior to 30 June last year the government tried on numerous occasions, by presenting legislation to the parliament, to outlaw the imposition of bargaining fees, and that legislation was defeated by the then opposition majority in the Senate.It is only since 30 June last year and the passage of Work Choices that we have been able to get off the statute books of this country any possibility of the introduction of bargaining fees. So, on two counts - the imposition of Labor's policy of compulsory union collective bargaining and the introduction of union bargaining fees, which is compulsory unionism by stealth - you would see a marked reduction in choice available in Australian workplaces.Let me end by saying this: it is the policy of the coalition that every Australian has the right to join a union without penalty or recrimination, and every Australian should have the right not to join a union without penalty or discrimination. We saw at the weekend the failure of Labor to enforce that principle. It showed that, if Labor wins, choice in the workplace will go, compulsory unionism will be back and Greg Combet's dream of unions once again running Australia will become a reality for him and a nightmare for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released its publication on births in 2005 and reported that the number of births registered was 259,791 - a 2.2 per cent increase over 2004 and the highest level since 1993. The publication also disclosed the total fertility rate, the number of live births per female over their reproductive life. The total fertility rate in 2005 was 1.81, up from 1.77 in 2004 and up from the long-term low of 1.73 in 2001. This means that Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has managed to increase its total fertility rate in recent decades. The fertility rate went into long-term decline in 1961, falling from 3.55 to a low of 1.73. Now it has recovered to 1.81. Australia compares favourably with countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany and Japan, which have total fertility rates of 1.3. Our total fertility rate is slightly higher than that of the United Kingdom but lower than that of the United States, which is at 2.0.Although that is welcome, the fact of the matter is that unless the total fertility rate is 2.1 we are still below replacement level. Because we are below replacement level, the ageing of the population continues. The proportion of those of retirement age compared with those of working age continues to grow. But, as I said earlier, the good news is that Australia's total fertility rate has increased and we are one of the few countries in the Western world that has managed to do that. That occurred in calendar year 2005, precisely seven months after the May 2004 budget. That budget introduced the maternity payment, which is a payment now of $4,000 on the birth of each child, and it is warmly welcomed by parents around Australia. In addition, in July 2004 the government increased the rates of family benefits, we provided additional childcare places and subsequently we announced the introduction of the childcare rebate. It was during that budget that Australians were urged to have 'one for mum, one for dad and one for the country', and it appears that some Australians have taken up the challenge.I should also say that one of the things that was introduced as part of the More Help for Families package back in 2004 was an annual payment of $600 in family allowance to each child in respect of every year. Even today, every family that qualifies for family allowance on an annual basis is eligible for $600 per child. For two children a family get $1,200 and for three children they get $1,800. What is more, that is real money. It is money that goes into the bank, it is money that comes out of the bank, it is money that can buy goods and services and it is money the Australian Labor Party tried to abolish. Few will forget when, during the 2004 election, the member for Lilley - Mr Gilligan over there - ran around Australia claiming that abolishing the $600 payment would not matter, because it was not real money. This is real money, alright, and the families of Australia know it to be the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. With respect to the last part of his question, I will not take at face value his statement regarding my colleague's own comments. I have met with Western Australian wheat growers as well as their representatives. I have conveyed their views strongly to the new Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Wheat Board, Gordon Davis. He is considering the matters and is fully cognisant of the fact that he must win the confidence and support of Western Australian wheat growers to maintain the national pool.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise that a significant proportion of his electorate has been drought declared and has also been receiving assistance from the federal government because of that circumstance. It is critically important at this time that all of Australia, through the federal government, stand by Australia's farming community. The announcement that was made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in terms of the rollover of exceptional circumstances has been widely welcomed because it will give comfort to those farming families across regional Australia who are suffering at the moment from almost the driest and hottest drought that we have had in the history of records being kept in Australia. As the Prime Minister has made very clear, we will continue to support these families and communities.The member asked if there were other views. Unfortunately there have been a few views expressed, with regard to the viability of farmers across Australia, that the government should not be propping up unviable farmers. The government does not prop up unviable farmers. What we have announced is assistance for exceptional circumstances, and that is exactly what it is: assistance for exceptional circumstances. These people cannot help that it has not rained. - We have people like the executive director -  - of the left-wing organisation the Australia Institute -  - running around and saying that we should not be supporting the farming community in their time of need, which is just outrageous. To support that, the facts are very clear. The OECD indicates that agricultural support from governments across some of the major agricultural producers is very low in Australia. Listen to these figures on government support for agriculture, the income at the farm from government. In Japan it is 56 per cent, in the European Union it is 32 per cent, in the United States it is 16 per cent and in Australia it is five per cent. We do not prop up unviable farmers in Australia. Australia's farmers are very competitive and they are facing dire circumstances.In an article in the Australian today Mr George Davis of southern Victoria, a grain grower, says that his drought relief payment 'is the difference between eating and not eating'. That is not propping up an unviable business; that is helping a family survive this drought. I think it is outrageous when you have someone like Dr Hamilton from the left-wing Australia Institute making comments in the media like, 'By repeatedly bailing out farmers through drought relief, which is erroneously called exceptional circumstances relief, we are only making the problem worse.' I would invite Dr Hamilton to go and talk to some of the families suffering in areas of exceptional circumstance from drought through no fault of their own and to say that this is erroneous support that we are giving the farmers of Australia. Australia's farmers are amongst the most efficient and competitive in the world, given decent climatic circumstances, and it goes without saying that we will continue to support them.It is interesting to look at who else is on the board of the Australia Institute, which holds this view about Australia's farmers, because Dr Hamilton was speaking on behalf of the Australia Institute. Of course, none other than the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow, sits on the board of the institute. So maybe the next thing we are going to hear is not just comments about unviable farmers. We are going to hear them say, 'They shouldn't be in farming unless they hold a union ticket.'</DOC>

 - I am pleased that the member for Griffith is taking such interest in the democratic processes of the National Party of Australia and the conference that we held in full view of the Australian media in Canberra last weekend. On the substantive issue that the member for Griffith raises, there were a range of motions about Australian wheat growers, the Australian grain industry and export industry. The motion was not pulled. They were consolidated and there was a great debate about the overall issue of the management of the Australian wheat industry and the future of Australian wheat growers. The most important point to make out of this is that the only reason the member for Griffith has the information to ask the question -  - is that we let the media come into our conference and report everything that was debated, unlike the Australian Labor Party in Adelaide, which forced Old Skip to go and do his media conference in the car park.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. He is a strong advocate for farmers in his electorate, and we deal on an almost daily basis on agriculture and drought issues. So he was very buoyed by the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday that all eligible producers in exceptional circumstances declared areas in his electorate - including Young, Yass, Braidwood and Goulburn - will be able to access much-needed support for at least another 18 months. This was part of the government's first instalment of additional measures in response to the increasingly devastating drought.Farmers battling drought in 18 exceptional circumstances declared areas will receive an additional $350 million in drought support. This will bring the government's commitment to date, as of today, to the current drought to $1½ billion. The assistance will be extended to all eligible producers, be they pastoralists, irrigators, dairy farmers or horticulturalists, in each of the regions until 31 March 2008. This is a very significant policy announcement by the government - the importance of which is not lost upon anybody in the rural community. The areas that we extended yesterday were coming to the end of their declarations, and there remain approximately another 38 regions which the government will be examining shortly.I remind the House of the important role that farmers play in our local, state and national economies. Despite the severe drought of the last six years, Australian farmers have achieved record levels of production. Their exports account for a quarter of our export earnings and more than 350,000 Australians are directly employed in agriculture. Farming underpins a great many rural communities which would be lost to Australia without the farming income. On top of that, a great many small businesses service the farming sector. So by government, on behalf of the taxpayer and the wider community, supporting farmers we are also supporting those small businesses to the greatest extent possible through this drought. Also bear in mind that farmers have stewardship of 60 per cent of Australia's landmass and, therefore, they play a very important role.I make these obvious points to those critics who believe that drought assistance is not warranted. On economic and environmental grounds - let alone social grounds - it is vitally important. For that reason, our government will support farmers who make that vital contribution and we will continue to do so into the future.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. The Australian Defence Force has a deployment at the request of the Iraqi government, along with other international forces, of about 1,400, who have been transferring responsibility as time has gone on to the Iraqis in Al Muthanna province. In the process, they have been training up Iraqi forces and they have been helping, in Dhi Qar province, to provide security for the Iraqis. We also have the Navy involved, heading a coalition naval force of 10 ships, including the Royal Australian Naval vessel, Warramunga, which are protecting oil platforms. We have committed over $173 million to help with rehabilitation, reconstruction, elections, the Iraqi Special Tribunal and establishing electricity and water systems.This is a country with millions of people who risked their lives to vote for a democratically elected government. It wants coalition forces to remain for the time being, and we are staying there and helping them for the time being. We on this side of the House are proud of what we do. Are there any criticisms? Yes; the Labor Party, in particular, is the chief critic of the government on this issue and argues that the more appropriate course of action would be to surrender. On this side of the House we do not warm to the notion of surrender or hauling up the white flag. One of the reasons that we are not in favour of surrender is that we believe it would only enhance the terrorist movement internationally, including in our own region. The Labor Party likes to quote from the American National Intelligence Estimate global terrorism report. I will also quote from it. That report said:... perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere.I think that pretty much sums it up.On ABC radio this morning, the member for Griffith admitted, 'Jihadists flow into that country' - being Iraq - 'from all directions.' The interviewer asked the member for Griffith not once, not twice - I cannot keep going on - but eight times on AM this morning what the consequences would be if international forces just fled from Iraq, and the member for Griffith refused to answer that question eight times. Eight times he refused to answer a simple question about what the consequences would be of the Leader of the Opposition's cut-and-run policy in Iraq. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition was on the Jon Faine program, it was exactly the same story. Quizzed on that program about how quickly he would pull the troops out, the Leader of the Opposition said that he would discuss that with the Americans and went on to say: 'How long is it going to take you' - that is, the Americans - 'to put in people to replace us?'In other words, the Leader of the Opposition's proposition is that this great country would pull out its forces and ask others to do the job for us. We would go to our ally, the Americans, in the morally bankrupt way that the Leader of the Opposition proposes and say to the Americans, 'Find someone else to do this job. We are too weak to continue with it.' Not in the history of this country have we been governed by people as weak as that and this government would never do that sort of thing. The fact is that the Labor Party has the view that it is onto a winner with its cut-and-run policy from Iraq. But it cannot answer the question and it will not answer the question: what are the consequences in the war against terrorism? What are the consequences for international security and what are the consequences for the people of Iraq of the Labor Party's weak and gutless policy?</DOC>

 - I am quite happy to answer the question. The Labor Party says, 'Guilty!' Indeed! Guilty of standing up for the free people of Iraq, guilty of getting rid of Saddam Hussein's evil regime -  -  - As I was saying, I am guilty of standing up for the people of Iraq, the people who had the courage to go and vote in those elections and the people who had the courage to put in place a democratic government. Yes, I am a guilty man standing up for those people. -  - I am guilty of helping to get rid of Saddam Hussein's evil regime. I am guilty of that. A man who started a war with his neighbours and killed a million people in that war, a man who slaughtered the Shia majority -  - The Labor Party is guilty. The Labor Party is guilty of being weak. The Labor Party is guilty of pursuing a policy which would lead to a victory for terrorists. The Labor Party is guilty of wanting to keep in place Saddam Hussein's regime.The member for Griffith then left the chamber. - Finally, the Leader of the Opposition is guilty of grossly misleading this House yesterday when he said that the government had lied about weapons of mass destruction. Yet he himself said on 7 February 2003:No foreign office or defence department official anywhere on the globe entertains the view that Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction.The Leader of the Opposition - if ever there were somebody guilty - is guilty of misleading this House. - And his greatest failing of all -  - is that he is a weak man.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. I note that the unemployment rate in Casey stands at 4.2 per cent; 4.2 per cent is very good news for the people who live in Croydon, Lilydale and the other suburbs that the member for Casey so well represents in this place. Indeed I can also inform him that, since the introduction of Work Choices on 27 March, we have seen the creation of 205,000 jobs in Australia and significantly 184,000 of those jobs are full-time jobs for Australians. Also in the last six months we have seen some other interesting developments - for example, the signing in Adelaide of the one millionth Australian workplace agreement and more than 2,000 employee and union collective agreements entered into.What this does is contradict, with factual data, the false and misleading claim that the Leader of the Opposition makes that Australians cannot enter into a collective agreement. Two thousand collective agreements have been entered into. What this illustrates once again is what this government believes, and that is that Australian employers and employees should have choice in relation to their industrial arrangements in the workplace. This stands in stark contrast to what the Leader of the Opposition has reconfirmed as one of the central planks of the ALP's workplace relations policy on the weekend: the no ticket, no start part of that policy. Indeed, one of the ALP stalwarts - in fact, one of the new ALP presidents - Mike Rann, the Premier of South Australia, was supporting the ban on non-union journalists from reporting on the Australian Labor Party conference. This is what Mr Rann said -  - Obviously, the member for Grayndler does not want this heard. As I recall, he was one of those at the doorstop who had not heard and feigned ignorance about this yesterday. Can I tell him what Mr Rann said? I am sure he would like to hear what an ALP president says. - When Mr Rann was asked about this ban on non-union members of the media reporting on the ALP conference in Adelaide, Mr Rann said: 'If you join a union, you'll be allowed in.' That is a closed shop. It is illegal now, but this is a harbinger of what we would expect to see if the ALP were elected to government in Australia. It is equally weak of the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. All the Leader of the Opposition could say about this ridiculous ban was: 'We stand shoulder to shoulder with the union movement in our struggle for industrial relations.' The Leader of the Opposition said about Mr Rann on Sunday: 'If the future has a face, it's Mike's.' If this is the face of the future, heaven help the economy of Australia! This is a return to the closed shop; a return to no ticket, no start; a return to compulsory unionism in Australia. Indeed, if Mr Rann and the Leader of the Opposition get their way, then the only choice for employees and workers in Australia will be: 'Join a union if you want to get a job' - and that is absolutely no choice for Australian workers. It is very simple: a future under Mr Rann and under this weak Leader of the Opposition is a future in which there is no choice.</DOC>

 - I will tell the House one thing -  -  - From March 2003, Saddam Hussein was not paying any money into any account anywhere. Saddam Hussein was overthrown and there was no risk after March 2003 of Saddam Hussein funding terrorists. - Since March 2003, Saddam Hussein has paid no money to terrorists, and he has not paid money to terrorists -  - because Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown and, subsequently, towards the end of 2003, he was arrested. - I do not need to ask any government whether getting rid of Saddam Hussein stopped Saddam Hussein funding terrorism, because it did. But I do know that if the Leader of the Opposition's policy had remained in place Saddam Hussein would still be funding terrorism, and you would have that on your conscience. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do not think members of the opposition have ever asked me a question on the South Pacific since the Bougainville crisis, which we helped to resolve. I do not think they have, but I could be being unfair. I am sure that the member for Maribyrnong, the shadow minister, has never asked me a question. The South Pacific has never been important enough for the member for Maribyrnong to ask a question about.There was an alternative approach, which was the Labor approach. That was to pay hundreds of millions of dollars every year in aid and not focus on governance, not express any concern about poor quality of governance and not run strong and decisive anticorruption programs. When we came to government we had to deal with the legacy of that.This government is determined to provide not just assistance to the ordinary people of countries such as the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. I think we have demonstrated that in spades through the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands and also through the Papua New Guinea Enhanced Cooperation Program. But we are not going to do so in a way which allows a continuation of poor governance and corruption where that may exist. Where we fear that that does exist we will obviously respond to it and try to deal with it.Very specifically, it is hardly surprising that this government is totally opposed to the whole concept of child sex tourism. The Hawke government introduced the laws, by the way, to make it an international offence in relation to Australian citizens. Where an Australian citizen is facing charges of that kind then, regardless of his or her occupation, it is right and proper that that person be pursued vigorously. In the case of Mr Julian Moti, the Australian Federal Police want him back in Australia. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions wants him to face charges. In circumstances where another government flies such a person on a government aircraft to sanctuary - in this case, to the Solomon Islands - we regard that as an extremely serious matter. It is not a matter where we would just turn a blind eye. We will not show ourselves to lack interest or concern about this. It is hardly surprising that this government has taken a strong stand.There are many people in Papua New Guinea and, for that matter, in the Solomon Islands who agree with what we are saying and doing. There are many good people in politics, in government generally and in the defence force of Papua New Guinea - honest and honourable people. But there are some who are not. The fact is that this government will continue to show strength and determination in dealing with that problem because the opposition will show what it always shows: the weak approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his ongoing support of government policies to ensure not only that the economy continues to grow but also that we continue to address our renewable and environmental issues. Since this government came to power, we can stand tall on our record on renewable energy investment. Government policies are currently seeing $123 million placed into the expansion and extension of the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, $100 million into the Renewable Energy Development Initiative and $75 million into the Solar Cities program, which I had the pleasure of launching the Queensland leg of with the member for Herbert. That was extraordinarily well received by the people of Townsville. As well, there is the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, which is accessible to renewable energy technologies. We should not forget the mandatory renewable energy target, which is expected to see some $3 billion worth of investment in the renewable energy sector.The results speak for themselves. Under this government, wind energy capacity has increased in Australia by 7,000 per cent - from 10 megawatts in 2000 to 700 megawatts in 2005. Solar energy has also grown, with the number of solar hot-water system sales doubling since 2000-01 and extra capacity in solar photovoltaic also being installed. These are impressive gains, but the government has not been putting all of our eggs in one basket. We are focusing on a broad range of technologies that include renewables, clean coal technology and potentially nuclear technology.But I was asked about alternative greenhouse policies. Unfortunately, from the Labor Party there is nothing that could be considered credible. Despite what those opposite will tell you, taxes and targets do not constitute a credible greenhouse policy. Without the technology in the first place, taxes and targets simply mean that Australian industries and jobs will be exported.But there is light on the other side, as there always is, from the member for Batman. In the Australian newspaper earlier this year, when talking about Labor Party emissions targets, the member for Batman said:The problem for countries, not just Australia, is fronting up to how we're going to achieve those targets.He went on to say:You can't just think up some harebrained idea and impose it on industry if you want to keep jobs in Australia. You have got to work out the detail.I could not agree more. And that is exactly what this government is doing: working out the details and finding technology based solutions to greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

 - As indicated last night by the minister for immigration, the allegations made in relation to Dartbridge Welding and Filipino workers are being investigated. I will await that investigation before passing judgement on the allegations that have been made. There is some suggestion that they are being paid the market rates, but let us have all of the facts.Of one thing we can be absolutely certain, and it is this: in investigating that issue, the government will consistently uphold the principle of freedom of association. We will make sure that, if people have suffered a penalty because they joined the union, there will be some redress as a result of that -  -  - unlike those poor journalists on Saturday -  - who were told that they could not come into that conference unless they joined the relevant union. - Mr Speaker, let me resume from where I was interrupted. We are going to vigorously enforce the principle of freedom of association. As far as we are concerned it is an inalienable right of any Australian to join or not to join an association. Every man and woman on this side of the House holds to that -  - Mr Speaker, I thought the question was about the rights of people in Australia - their rights, whether they are of Filipino extraction or whether they are a journalist, a welder, a businessman or a businesswoman. What it is about is whether, under a future government of this country, if it were to be Labor, people would lose the right to join or not to join an organisation. -  - It is a very simple principle and it is a principle that I am going to see enforced. I say to the member for Lyons, for whom I have some regard -  - that it is a very simple principle. Are you for or against freedom of association? We on this side of the House are for it; those on that side of the House -  - Can I say, I agree with the member for Grayndler that it is a very simple question: are you for freedom or are you against it? That is the question in relation to this issue, as it is in relation to a matter dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs -  - I will make sure and the government will make sure during this investigation that the right of freedom of association is upheld. And if that has in any way been abrogated then there would be a consequence of that abrogation. But let me make it clear, in the course of answering this question, that this is a principle that has to be applied with equal force on both sides of the argument. If it is all right to punish a company for imposing a penalty on somebody who has joined a union, it ought to be equally right to impose a like penalty on those who are forced to join a union. That is the difference: we are for freedom of choice; Labor is against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. She has a very intense interest in defence and local issues in her community. In 1942 - which is arguably the most important year in Australia's history since European settlement - as the battle for Australia raged through New Guinea and the Pacific, the then Australian government made a decision to build a propellent factory at Mulwala on the Murray River. That propellent factory, essentially producing and manufacturing the explosive materials for our munitions, has for more than 60 years produced propellents for Australia so that we can be independent. Under no circumstances would Australia accept the position of fully importing our own ammo.There are some in Australia who argue that Australia should close this factory, which is ageing, and instead import propellents from other parts of the world. The members for Farrer, Indi and Murray stood up very firmly for their communities, supported by the Prime Minister, and argued that the government should instead rebuild the propellent factory at Mulwala. To that end, some $300 million will be directly invested with Bovis Lend Lease to build the propellent factory. The Public Works Committee of the parliament will shortly consider the project. We expect to sign an agreement with the company in the first half of next year, and the graders and bulldozers will be in there early in 2008 to rebuild the factory.I say to the 320 people who are employed at the ADI factory at Mulwala: your jobs and your families who rely upon those jobs are safe and secure. As for the 350 people in the communities who rely also on the factory, their jobs are secure, and the 300 people who work at Benalla building munitions from those propellents, their jobs also are secure. As the Albury-Wodonga Border Mail put it on Friday:For the residents of Yarrawonga and Mulwala __            _            _Yesterday's announcement will provide much comfort to the two towns, as well as to Wangaratta, Benalla and centres in between.And when the work actually starts there will be a further massive spin-off to the local economy.In fact, there will be 200 people employed on the project itself. The paper said:The announcement is a tribute to the effort put in to saving the _ plant by the district.I particularly give credit to the member for Farrer, the member for Indi and the member for Murray.</DOC>

 - I do not accept that 'rorting' of the 457 visa system is a proper description of the way the system in its totality is operated. If I had to prosecute a case on this, the first witness for the prosecution against the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition would be the New South Wales Minister for Health, because the New South Wales health department has used the 457 visa system more than anybody else. The second witness for the prosecution would be Mr Eric Ripper, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, who has practically pleaded with the minister for immigration to let more people in. Mr Speaker, if ever you have seen hypocrisy on an issue, it is this lot opposite in relation to 457 visas. At a state level, they have got ministers running around the country wringing their hands and saying, 'We can't get enough workers to run our meatworks, to run the resource industries in Western Australia -  - to run the booming industries of Queensland.' Yet at a federal level you have got the Labor Party running around saying there is mass exploitation. It is as plain as the nose on your face that this country at the present time is suffering the consequences of an exuberant, prosperous, high-employment economy. As the Treasurer said the other day, 'It's a terrific problem to have.'For the 32 years that I have been in this place, the holy grail has been to have near full employment, and we have now achieved it. We have a 30-year low in unemployment. We have a situation where we do not face a shortage of jobs; we in fact face a shortage of workers. That is a magnificent problem to have, when I think of the problems we had with high unemployment - when I think back to when the man who asked me this question, the Leader of the Opposition, was the minister for unemployment in the early 1990s. He basically gave up on trying to get unemployment down. He basically said that the problem was beyond him and that really people should stop complaining. I can remember when my predecessor was Prime Minister, when unemployment was 8½ per cent, the Leader of the Opposition went on the John Laws program and said, 'You've never had it so good.' That was the measure, Mr Speaker. And now, fast forward to 2006 and, gee, do we have a problem! We have the problem that the economy is strong -  - and it is prosperous. And it is a strength and a prosperity of which this government is unquestionably proud. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for the question. Of course, the member for Gwydir would be well aware of some of the commentary that has been raised in recent days with the recognition of the devastation of drought across Australia and the circumstances it has left many of Australia's farmers in, and the assistance that the government has announced for farmers in areas of exceptional circumstance. But also there has been commentary with regard to the ability of farmers to help manage the natural resources of our nation - the water and the land resources in our nation. It becomes quite important when we start looking at drought circumstances and the impact that that has on the land.Last week - and the member for Gwydir would be interested in this information - the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a survey which highlights the amount of time, money and effort that farmers spend on managing our environment, particularly those parts of our environment that they are directly responsible for. The ABS found that, in 2004-05, Australian farmers on average spent about $3.3 billion on natural resource management - that was an average of $28,000 per farm per annum of their own money - and each farmer spent about 121 days per year on natural resource management in the areas of their direct responsibility. The member for Gwydir would also be pleased to hear that farmers in the Border Rivers-Gwydir region were among the top three spenders in the nation, contributing $157 million towards natural resource management in that part of the Australia - in the north-west of New South Wales.There are more than 4,000 landcare groups in Australia reaching 75 per cent of farmers and land managers, and so there is significant interaction between the people that have direct control of the land and the people interested in better landcare management and better management of our land resources. As a government, we are actively assisting our farmers. In the current budget, we are providing $37 million for landcare in addition to programs such as the $3 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund and the $1.4 billion National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. So there are significant streams of funding going into these critical areas of natural resource management.The important point to note is that the broader farming community are doing their part in this challenge in this job as far as helping to manage the natural resources in our country. It is important that we recognise that these figures and these examples dispel the myth that Australian farmers are not responsible stewards of the environment; on the contrary, they are arguably critical to the overall national effort of better managing our environment and our natural resources across Australia. Therefore farmers in their time of need should be supported by governments in ensuring that we maintain that economic and social fabric right across regional Australia so they can continue to make those contributions in helping the nation manage our natural resources.</DOC>

 - The member for Jagajaga attempted to ask a question about welders on the National Skill Shortage List yesterday. Interestingly, in asking that question directed to me, she asked the wrong minister; the National Skill Shortage List is in fact administered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, so the member for Jagajaga cannot get right any of the basic elements of the way the national trading system operates.I can say, again for the record, that we have 403,00 people in training in Australia in apprenticeships right now and 1.7 million people in training across a variety of different pursuits. -  - These are record numbers. This government has set a record expenditure level that has never been exceeded by any previous government. The simple point is that Australians in their hundreds of thousands are embracing opportunities to participate in the trades. We celebrate that on this side because we think they are nation-building trades. Those on that side have their comfort zone which, to sum up, is: if you haven't got a university degree, you are a dud. You are all job snobs over there.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Figures released today by the Treasury and published through the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that Australia's nominal private sector wealth is at a record high in nominal terms and in terms of the percentage of GDP. In the June quarter of 2006, Australia's private sector wealth stood at $7.1 trillion, around 745 per cent of GDP. This has increased by $5.1 trillion since March of 1996 and risen from 400 per cent of GDP in March of 1996 to 745 per cent of GDP today. In other words, not only has private sector wealth increased but also private sector wealth growth has outstripped the growth of the economy and instead of being four times the level of GDP, it is now over seven times.Private sector wealth grew 18.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter. This was led by business capital, which grew 38.8 per cent, and private business investment, which grew 16.2 per cent. Australia's households benefit from this because 41 per cent of Australians own shares, so Australians have a part in that growth of wealth. Dwelling capital has also contributed to the growth in wealth over the last year. Not only has this been an extraordinarily high rate of growth of private wealth but also it has been distributed to all deciles of Australian income households.You will quite often hear some people say that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Over the last eight years in Australia, the rich have got richer and the poor have got richer. In fact, the ABS reports that there has been no significant increase in inequality from the mid-nineties to 2003-04. ABS data shows that between 1995-96 and 2003-04, the equivalised real incomes of low-income households increased 22 per cent. What we see is that there has been a huge run-up in wealth in Australia and there has been a very significant increase in incomes for the lowest income earners in Australia. What has done that? Mr Speaker, you would have to observe that the decline in unemployment to 4.8 per cent has given the low-income earners in our society a better chance for a job - that has been No. 1. No. 2, tax and family benefits changes have delivered very direct benefits back to low-income earners including real increases in pensions, which the government has put in place because we fix pensions to MTAWE rather than to CPI. In addition, this government's tax changes have reduced taxes for lower income earners and increased the low-income tax offset. We have lived through a period of extraordinary growth in business, employment and private sector wealth, a growth which, when it is assessed, will probably compare favourably to any other period of Australian economic history and which has been distributed right across the income scale in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know he has a great deal of interest - given where his electorate is - in East Timor and in the people of East Timor. The report of the United Nations Special Commission of Inquiry was handed to the East Timor government, I understand, yesterday morning and was released more generally during yesterday. It is the Australian government's view that this is a credible report. It sets out the facts surrounding the destructive events of April and May this year, clarifies the issue of responsibilities and recommends certain action to be taken.We welcome President Xanana Gusmao's address to the nation last night. He was accompanied in that address by the Prime Minister, Jose Ramos Horta, and the President of the Parliament of East Timor, Mr Guterres, and he called on all East Timorese to act responsibly and to behave with constraint. I can tell the House that up until lunchtime today the situation has continued to be quiet in East Timor and we obviously hope that will continue.I know from the discussions we had last week with Prime Minister Ramos Horta and also from the statements that were made in East Timor yesterday that the East Timorese leadership are taking a responsible approach to the commission's findings. I have no doubt that they are in some respects difficult findings. I encourage the East Timorese to follow their normal legal processes in dealing with the conclusions of the report, which I am sure they will do.Australia is a major donor to the East Timor law and justice sector, which will assist the East Timorese in their response to the commission's findings. Our assistance in policing includes support for the UNDP, providing international judges and court staff. Those of you who watched the Lateline program last night - and I thought it was a very good program last night, Prime Minister - will be aware that there was a report of Prime Minister Ramos Horta saying in a speech in Sydney that he did not feel his country had sufficient judicial resources. I make the point that not only is Australia doing what it can to help in that area but also we are providing support for the Prosecutor-General's office. We will continue to do what we can to help this new nation through this difficult period. I know that the leadership of East Timor will respond to the UN special commission of inquiry's report responsibly and I hope that the public will treat it with an appropriate degree of calm.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I note that every Australian workplace is different and, therefore, Work Choices is delivering the flexibility for individual businesses and employees to choose the type of agreement which best suits their workplace. This is borne out by the data from the Office of the Employment Advocate about the take-up of agreements over the past six months. Of the new agreements since Work Choices came into operation on 27 March this year, 70 per cent of workers are covered by collective agreements and 30 per cent of workers are covered by individual agreements.Unfortunately, the Labor Party has been unwilling to acknowledge the real benefits for Australians covered by Work Choices. For months we have had the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party running around this country maintaining that collective agreements would not exist under Work Choices, despite the real evidence otherwise. What we see after six months is 70 per cent of workers covered by collective agreements and 30 per cent covered by individual agreements.Even last night the member for Perth was maintaining this denial. He said, 'Collective agreements signed since the introduction of the government's industrial relations legislation are despite the laws, not because of them.' That reminds me: we used to have one rooster who used to crow that real money was not real. We now have the other rooster claiming that real agreements are not real. We had the spectacle over the weekend, when the Labor Party in South Australia refused to allow non-union members of the media to cover -  - their conference in Adelaide, of the Leader of the Opposition saying that he could not do anything about it. He was too weak to stand up to the union bosses in that instance. Today he came out and said, 'Oh, we'll get that changed.' On the weekend he was too weak to stand up and say, 'I'm going to have a media conference at the site of the conference.' He had to go out to the car park. Today he says, 'We'll change this policy.' I note that instead of having the guts to say, 'I will change the policy,' he says, 'I'll get the national executive of the ALP to do it.' That is not leadership. It was interesting that the Leader of the Opposition had to run out to a car park to hold this media conference on the weekend. Just before question time I went to the website of the Leader of the Opposition. - There are all sorts of media releases and speeches by the Leader of the Opposition on his website. But do you know what is missing from his website? What is missing is the doorstop that he performed in a car park in Adelaide. It is missing from the website of the Leader of the Opposition. What we have here is the Leader of the Opposition saying to the Australian people, 'I want to be heard on these issues,' but then hiding away the transcript of a doorstop on the issue involved. As I said, there are two things that are clear at this stage of the week. The first is -  - There are two things clear about this: first of all, once again, we have a demonstration of the essential weakness of the Leader of the Opposition, who is not fit to govern this country, and the second and final thing is that we now have a definitive Labor answer to that old riddle: why did the chicken cross the road? To do his doorstop in the car park.</DOC>

 - The data I referred to earlier shows that there is a clear choice for employers and employees. Seventy per cent of agreements which have been entered into -  - under Work Choices since 27 March are collective agreements and 30 per cent are individual agreements. - What does the labour movement and the ALP propose to do? What they propose is that - and remember they are talking about effective compulsory unionism now - unions can come along to a workplace under their so-called good faith bargaining, demand that the books, the accounts and the financial affairs of any business in Australia be totally opened up and, if there is a dispute about that, the union can go to the Industrial Relations Commission in this country and say that this is an intractable dispute and therefore take out of the agreement making between the employer and employees their responsibility to do that and have the one-size-fits-all pattern bargain approach that we had in the past. The reality is that this will take Australia back to the 1970s and 1980s. This would be a very serious mark against the Australian economy. It would be economic vandalism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I can inform him and other members that health and medical research is one of Australia's strongest areas of comparative economic advantage. It is not necessarily widely recognised, but in international terms Australia's health and medical research is just a strong as our sport. Australia has produced no fewer than six Nobel prize winners in health and medical research. The heart pacemaker, the ultrasound scanner, the bionic ear, aspro, penicillin and, most recently, a vaccine for cervical cancer were all discovered in Australia or by Australians.This week the government announced a further $529 million in research grants funded through the National Health and Medical Research Council. This money is important because today's research is tomorrow's new drugs or new medical treatments. This funding includes some $6.5 million for research at Flinders University, which would interest the member for Kingston. It also includes some $15 million for anti-obesity research, including almost $1 million for anti-obesity research conducted at South Australian universities. I am very pleased to say that health and medical research funding has increased fivefold since 1996 thanks to the policies of the Howard government. This very substantial boost in health and medical research funding is one of the many reasons why our health system remains amongst the best in the world.</DOC>

 - I certainly believe that obesity is a very important public health issue, one of the most important public health issues our country faces. Government has a role and, in fulfilling that role, the Prime Minister committed $116 million to this back in 2004. The Prime Minister and the premiers committed half a billion dollars to this issue at the COAG in February. But, just as government has a role, individuals also have a role. In the end, no government can or should try to regulate what individuals eat or the amount of exercise they take. I have to say that the question from the member opposite demonstrated just how committed to the nanny state the current Australian Labor Party is.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and congratulate him on his excellent speech in the Main Committee today, where he stood up for the ordinary people of Iraq. - President Bush spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki this week and reassured him of America's full support. He said that the United States would back his efforts to continue building democracy in Iraq and do tougher, necessary work going after the militias and the terrorists. It is the wish of the Iraqi government for the coalition forces to stay the course in Iraq. Particularly noteworthy was a statement made by Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Labour leader, overnight, who made clear his commitment. He said:What we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan is important. It is important for the security of our country, for the security of the world ...Mr Blair stressed the point that is often made that if the terrorists win in Iraq they will be emboldened everywhere. Prime Minister Blair stressed the need to continue working to support freedom and democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan despite the reaction in those countries of the extremists. He said:... if they are going to use that as an excuse to cause further extremism or violence, that is a reflection on them, it is not a reflection on the work we are doing in Iraq or Afghanistan.Both President Bush and Prime Minister Blair - and, indeed, Prime Minister Maliki - understand that the sort of weakness we heard about from the Labor Party this week will get us nowhere. Mr Blair said:You don't defeat them by sending a message saying we are prepared to walk away. - Let me repeat that, because I do not think everyone heard it. Prime Minister Blair, the Labour leader, said:That is why it is important - as I say, we want to withdraw from Iraq when we can, but it has to be done with the objective secured. There speaks a leader of a labour party. There speaks somebody who has strength and who shows leadership, who is not just trying to chase a popular position. - I am reminded, when I listen to what the Labor Party says, of George Orwell's famous words - after all, he was a socialist, but not a weak one. He said:The quickest way to end a war is to lose it.The Labor Party says it would like us to lose the war, to surrender, and, as Mr Blair says, that will only give great comfort, great support and great encouragement to terrorists.</DOC>

 - One of the definitions of failure is lack of courage. On that definition, there is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition is a catastrophic failure. -  - This is a Leader of the Opposition who has changed his position on the Iraq issue many times. He claims that we went to war in Iraq on a lie; he claimed that today. The Jull committee produced a report which made it clear that the government did not distort the intelligence. Indeed, it concluded that the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than that of either of its alliance partners. -  - We should take note of the interjections of the Leader of the Opposition, because I am going to get to the end of my answer to his question and people will be interested in the end of my answer. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say -  -  - The Jull committee's conclusion went on to say:The government's emphatic claim about the existence of Iraqi WMD reflected the views of the Office of National Assessments ...I mention this and the moderate and sensible conclusions of the Jull committee because it is relevant to this question. This committee produced a bipartisan report signed by coalition members and Labor members and it made it clear that the government did not lie about the WMD intelligence. The Jull committee makes that perfectly clear. One of the signatories of that report was none other than the Leader of the Opposition himself. Today he has a new line.Have we failed? There are 36,000 new teachers who have been trained in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. That is not a definition of failure. Seventy per cent of eligible children have been vaccinated against measles and 42 per cent against polio. Fifty-four commercial television stations have been set up from virtually zero in 2003. There are now more than seven million mobile phone -  The member for Melbourne then left the chamber. 
 - It is not a failure for new television services to be set up. It is not a failure for new teachers to be trained. It is not a failure for children to be inoculated. It is not a failure to have seven million new mobile phone subscribers. It is not a failure to get the first World Bank loan in 30 years. It is not a failure to get oil production up to prewar levels. It is not a failure to have trained 302,000 members of the Iraqi Security Forces. I will tell you, Mr Speaker, the last thing that is not a failure: it is not a failure to have put Saddam Hussein on trial.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for the question and recognise the particularly close links between his state of Western Australia and his keen interest in the economic ties and the development between Western Australia and South Africa. Australia is developing a robust trade and investment relationship with South Africa and it is set to grow and become even stronger.We are honoured to have in the gallery today Mr Mandisi Mpahlwa, who is South Africa's Minister for Trade and Industry. We cordially welcome him and his delegation to Australia. He and I are currently chairing the fourth meeting of the Australia-South Africa Joint Ministerial Committee to look at ways in which we can further advance our trading and investment relationship. Our delegations are accompanied by large numbers of business leaders from both countries and we are talking through new opportunities.Perhaps Australians, in particular, may not be so aware of the growth in our trading relationship with South Africa over recent years. South Africa is our 19th largest trading partner and Australia is South Africa's seventh largest trading partner with a two-way merchandise trade approaching $4 billion. Australia's merchandise exports to South Africa last year grew by 34 per cent; South Africa's to Australia grew by 22 per cent. Whilst there may have been, in previous times, some concern that our economies were similar and our seasonal conditions did not have the complementarities that we have with those in the Northern Hemisphere, it is quite clear that both countries have benefited from this trading relationship. A good example is the billion dollars worth of trade in cars between our countries. We import BMWs, Mercedes and VWs from South Africa and export to South Africa Camrys and Ford Territorys. That is an excellent example of the way in which our economies can work together. There is no better example of the strength of our unity than the great Australian BHP with the great South African company Billiton, which make up the world's biggest mining consortium.We watched with interest as South Africa was honoured to become the first African country ever to host the World Cup. In 2010 all eyes will be on South Africa and I hope that Australia will be one of the teams that will be participating in that big event in South Africa. But, even if it is not, there will be Australians there - our engineers and our event organisers are already starting to play a role in winning contracts and being a part of South Africa's preparation for that big event.I welcome today this opportunity to meet with my South African counterpart. The business delegations are working very constructively together to look at new ways where we can work together. I have confidence that this trading relationship between our countries will grow and expand rapidly over the years ahead.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I make a couple of points. 
Opposition members - Resign! - My answer is threefold. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition - as I made very clear yesterday and also during the censure debate on Monday - went out there in 2002 and 2003 and told the Australian public before the war that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. - He did so on many occasions, and for the Leader of the Opposition now to come into this House and pretend that somehow he did not say those things -  - For the Leader of the Opposition to accuse others of misleading when he himself - The member for Lilley then left the chamber. - For him to come into this House and attack other members of the House - of course, particularly members of the government -  -  - for being misleading in relation to weapons of mass destruction when he himself was telling this parliament -  - and he was telling the Australian public before the war and after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein -  - that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction -  - and the member for Griffith was doing the same thing - is hypocrisy - The member for Lalor then left the chamber. - The second thing is that this particular allegation that the Leader of the Opposition is making today, which of course completely contradicts the position he took three years ago, demonstrates one very important thing about this Leader of the Opposition: that not a day passes without his position changing.The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - The third point I would make, which the Leader of the Opposition chose rather conveniently to overlook, is that the presentation by the Australian government, he believes, was more moderate and more measured than that of either of its alliance partners. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and that the government's -  - The member for Griffith obviously is talking, as usual, more than he is listening, because I was just quoting from the Jull report. The quote - I repeat, signed off by the Leader of the Opposition - is this:_ the presentation by the Australian government was more moderate and more measured than that of either of its alliance partners.That was the view of the Leader of the Opposition then. Today he says we lied, but he did not say that then. Today he has changed his mind. Back in those days he used to say Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. -  - The final point is that the Leader of the Opposition -  - The final point I would make is that the Leader of the Opposition doubted the judgement that the Islamic extremists, jihadists and insurgents would be encouraged - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - The simple point is that the Leader of the Opposition at the end of his question made the point that he thinks by surrendering in Iraq it is the wrong judgement to believe that the jihadists and the insurgents will have been helped. I do profoundly believe that is absolutely the wrong judgement, and I must say -  - I do not think there are many governments in the Western world who would share the opposition leader's judgement that the best course of action in Iraq is to surrender.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and for his strong support for alternative fuels. The news from the alternative fuel industry in Australia just keeps getting better and better. The LPG vehicle scheme, officially launched only 2½ weeks ago, continues to generate incredible community interest. At the close of business yesterday some 4,200 grants worth some $8.4 million had been approved to Australian motorists. And as the applications continue to roll in, more will, no doubt, be on the way.The popularity of this program has, of course, seen increased demand for LPG conversions and it is a shame the member for Melbourne is not here to listen to this. The increase in demand, and in that respect the response from industry, has been very encouraging. Over the last three months industry capacity for LPG conversions has more than doubled. According to LPG Australia, there were 4,000 conversions in July, 8,000 in August and 11,000 in September. And this proves the basic economic point for the member for Melbourne and others opposite: when the demand for services grow, the supply will soon follow.In addition to LPG installation there has been an increase in LPG installation courses offered by the TAFEs, and we look forward to industry capacity continuing to grow. While I am on the topic of industry growing capacity, we should not forget the tremendous gains that have been made in another important alternative fuel sector, the biofuels industry. The Howard government has put in place a suite of measures behind the biofuels sector. -  - Well, you're the ones who killed it. The Labor Party went out of their way to kill the biofuels industry in Australia. Under this suite of measures we have seen a boost in consumer confidence, a boost in consumer uptake and an increase in industry capacity. The results of that investment speak for themselves. In the last 12 months production of transport ethanol in Australia has increased by more than 75 per cent. Over the last 12 months we have gone from 70 service stations selling ethanol blends to, now, 400. The government is well on track to reach its target of 350 megalitres of biofuel, and in fact we expect to exceed it.This is all good news for the alternative fuel industry in Australia. It is growing - and that is good news for the industry, good news for the environment and good news for Australian motorists.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question, because the member for Lindsay was present when I officiated at the opening of the new centre in Penrith in the electorate of Lindsay. I know that she is very vitally interested in the progress in reforming the family law system and the outcomes that we are achieving as a result of that reform process. The government has delivered on its promise to have major improvements in the system and this is a success story, and the data now shows how family relationship centres are helping in relation to this initiative.From the start of July to the end of September - that is, in three months - over 9,100 people had contacted centres by phone; over 2,700 people had dropped into centres seeking assistance; and centres had conducted over 3,800 interviews or intake sessions. We have seen a situation where the number of dispute resolution sessions conducted at centres steadily increased from 224 in July to 637 in the month of September. The new family relationship advice line - it is an 1800 number: 050 321 - received 27,000 calls from July to September.The website, www.familyrelationships. gov.au, has recorded more than 89,000 hits in the same period. That is approximately 1,000 hits every day. In other words, these services are extremely popular and they are in demand. Before July, many people would not have known where to turn for help, but they have obviously found out very quickly that these centres are acting as the gateway to the new family law system.I think it speaks for the professionalism and the competence of the people we recruited to undertake this task that the centres were able to open on time and that the whole process has been handled so well - quite contrary to the suggestions that we were hearing from the member for Gellibrand. We are on track with the tendering process for the next 25 centres to open in July 2007. We have delivered on our promise to overhaul the family law system and to give Australian families a better chance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer is a series of yeses and noes, but I make this point in answer to the last part of the question: we will, along with our allies, pass the responsibility for security in Iraq over to the Iraqi security forces when they have the capacity to maintain a reasonable degree of security in that country. The alternative strategy is the Labor Party strategy. The Labor Party strategy is for all of the coalition forces to withdraw from Iraq and to create not only a human rights catastrophe but also an enormous boost to the extremists and insurgents. The member for Fowler then left the chamber. 
 - The very heart of this debate today is the proposition that the honourable member for Barton - and, above all, the Leader of the Opposition - is putting, and that is that the coalition forces should withdraw from Iraq and leave Iraq to the terrorists and the insurgents. I believe, and I think most Western governments believe - including some who do not have troops in Iraq - that if a withdrawal of that kind were to take place it would be a catastrophe in the struggle against terrorism. The Leader of the Opposition says that he would not only pull out Australian troops; he would also go to Washington and urge the United States to surrender in Iraq as well. As the national intelligence estimate demonstrated, this would be a major triumph for the extremists, the terrorists and the insurgents. This government will not surrender.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and for her very strong advocacy on behalf of the small businesses in her electorate. Work Choices has freed small business from the burden of having to pay 'go away money'. Work Choices has streamlined the agreement-making process between employers and employees, and it has reduced red tape. Since Work Choices was introduced, 175,000 jobs have been created. They have been created by people like Mr Phil Connolly, a small businessman from up on the Gold Coast. - I was on the point of explaining how those 175,000 jobs have been created by small business people like Mr Phil Connolly from the Gold Coast. I was asked by the member for Gilmore if there are any threats to these benefits for small business that Work Choices has achieved. I have to say that, yes, there are. Let me quote from a small businessman, Mr Connolly, who said, 'Labor does not care and is not listening to small business. Mr Beazley just does not appear to understand how small business works.' He said, 'I am concerned to hear that Mr Beazley would abolish AWAs and rip up Work Choices should Labor win government.'Small business people like Mr Connolly do feel threatened. The Australian Labor Party just have not come clean about the fact that they are working hand in hand with the ACTU to develop any policy for small business. It would be the only time that the Leader of the Opposition would be content to sit quietly and listen to the ACTU and allow them to speak for him rather than having something to say himself. Business is very concerned about this. - The Leader of the Opposition obviously is not. - Business is very concerned. Let me say - they might not want to hear it - that Melinda Cilento, from the Business Council of Australia, who holds the position, of course, of the Chief Economist, has said:... the ACTU was providing far more detail on workplace policy than the Labor Party, which heightened 'concerns about the direction of ALP policy'.In summary, we simply know that this further reinforces what the Leader of the Opposition has said on so many occasions, and I will remind him constantly that the Australian Labor Party has never pretended to be the party of small business.</DOC>

 - No - no to both questions. I have not shifted my position on Iraq. My position on Iraq remains that if the coalition were to withdraw from Iraq, an enormous propaganda victory would be delivered to the terrorists. They would use our withdrawal as a recruiting ground, particularly in Indonesia. The Leader of the Opposition often talks about our obligations to deal with terrorism closer to home. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: why does he want to give a propaganda boost to JI in Indonesia? Why does he want to do that if he is so concerned about the impact of terrorism at home? He must know, with his much vaunted understanding of international affairs, that a humiliation for America, a premature retreat by the coalition in Iraq, would deliver an enormous propaganda victory to the terrorists. They would use that and they would use it close to Australia.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question. I would like to take the opportunity of saying how I appreciate the member for Casey's personal determination to stand by the people of Iraq. I was very pleased to welcome in my office today Dr al-Shahristani, the Iraqi oil minister. He is of course a senior representative in a democratically elected government - a man who was imprisoned by Saddam Hussein for many years in the Abu Ghraib jail. He told me, amongst other things, that he wanted our troops to stay for the time being so that the Iraqis themselves had the chance to build up their security forces and eventually to reach a point where the Iraqis were able to sustain security in their own country. Of course, his position is exactly our position, and obviously the sooner that can happen the better. But the simple fact is that we have to accept, as he makes clear, that if the international forces were to leave too soon then democracy in Iraq would completely collapse and the country would be plunged into complete chaos.He did not want to see a premature withdrawal and he went on to say that Iraq was a main battlefield in the fight against international terrorism. The minister said to me that if terrorists were to win in Iraq that would be not only a catastrophe for Iraqis but a threat to the whole world. The minister rather optimistically described progress being made on the security front, particularly against the extremist Islamist fanatics coming into the country. He referred to the death of Dr al-Zarqawi and said 300 other top terrorist leaders had been killed or captured. He said that the terrorists had claimed that some 4,000 trained foreign fighters had been killed.He went on to explain the Iraqi political strategy to achieve national reconciliation and said that a number of major tribal leaders from the al-Anbar province, which is one of the more troubled parts of the country, had joined the fight against foreign terrorists. He talked about oil production in Iraq and said that there have been attempts by terrorists to blow up oil pipelines, particularly the oil pipeline into Turkey. I notice the Turkish Minister of Justice sitting with the Turkish ambassador in the public gallery. The pipeline going into their country gets attacked rather frequently. It is good to see the minister here. The Iraqi minister made the point that, despite those security problems, oil production in Iraq is around pre-war levels and he expects over the next three months that it will be considerably above pre-war levels. For those on this side of the House who are interested in petrol prices, that is obviously good news. In conclusion, I told the minister that the Australian government would not let the Iraqi people down. We will not turn our backs on the Iraqi people and we will not contribute to any surrender in Iraq.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Kalgoorlie - and he of course represents very significant wheat-growing areas of Western Australia, as do many Western Australian members on this side of the House - I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed by the Western Australian wheat growers. Those concerns arise from a conjunction of circumstances, including the severe impact of the drought, the concerns which have accumulated in relation to the proceedings before the Cole inquiry and other considerations.Our position regarding the single desk is well understood. We do not intend to take any precipitant decision regarding the single desk until the findings of the Cole inquiry are to hand, and then they will be very carefully considered. Of course, the future of the single desk is something on which there is a range of views in the Australian wheat industry, as there is in this parliament, but in relation to the particular issue raised by the member for Kalgoorlie, and that is the concerns of Western Australian wheat growers, can I inform him that I have discussed these concerns with Mr Ian Donges, the Chairman of AWB International, and I have arranged to meet Mr Donges and some of his fellow directors tomorrow to further discuss this issue.Let me assure the member for Kalgoorlie that decisions taken by this government in relation to this very difficult issue will have in mind overwhelmingly the interests of Australian wheat growers - as, indeed, should decisions taken by any participants in this issue have regard to those interests. The wheat industry in Australia has been an enormous contributor to the wealth of this nation over the years. The wheat growers of Australia, in company with many other farmers, are going through very difficult times and all of us need to have their interests uppermost in our minds when we take decisions about this vital industry.</DOC>

 - I will do that. The truth is that the -  -  - As Australia was an original participant in the military operation against Iraq, it stands to reason that the implications of our withdrawal would be enormous, and I repeat my position that if it is all right for Australia to withdraw why isn't it all right for the Americans and the British to do the same?What the Leader of the Opposition has to explain to the Australian people is a policy that would deliver a monumental victory to the terrorists in Iraq and would embolden the terrorists in Indonesia. They would go the length of the Indonesian archipelago saying: 'We defeated the coalition, including Australia, in Iraq. That is a reason to sign up to Jemaah Islamiah.' That is the burden that the Leader of the Opposition will carry. The Leader of the Opposition has to explain to the Australian people why it would be safer to deliver a monumental propaganda victory to the terrorists by our withdrawing from Iraq. That is the essence of this issue. The Leader of the Opposition has to justify a policy that would give an enormous boost to the terrorists in Indonesia - an enormous boost to the terrorists everywhere around the world. That is what the Leader of the Opposition -  - The Leader of the Opposition ought to focus his mind on justifying a policy that would heighten the terrorist threat in our own region. I have heard a lot from the Leader of the Opposition about how we have to focus on terrorism in our own region. I am focused on that and I know this: if you deliver a victory in Iraq you will deliver an enormous propaganda boost to terrorists in our own region and not least in Indonesia.</DOC>

 - I can certainly inform the member for Wakefield that the economic strength of Australia has been dramatically displayed in the single most important marker of economic success of a nation, and that is the capacity of a nation to generate jobs. I have often said in recent months that the holy grail of economic management in this nation is how successful you are in reducing unemployment. We now have a 30-year low in unemployment in this country, and in large areas of Australia, for all practical purposes, we have full employment. Our unemployment rate is at an historic low of 4.8 per cent and, more importantly and more contemporaneously, we have seen 205,000 new jobs created since April this year - 205,000 new jobs created since the introduction of the government's new industrial relations legislation. So much for all the prophecies of the world coming to an end, the sky falling in, wages going down, unemployment going up and there being mass dismissals and employees being persecuted all around Australia. All of those predictions have proved to be absolutely baseless. Australian workers and businesses now have the flexibility to work out arrangements that best suit their needs.More relevantly and more importantly for the different views of the two sides of politics in this place, a very significant thing happened yesterday in the South Australian parliament. The new senior vice-president of the Australian Labor Party and Premier of South Australia joined a gaggle of senior state Labor members in distancing himself from the Leader of the Opposition's policy of ripping up AWAs. - Oh, yes, he did. He certainly did. First of all, you had Alan Carpenter, the Premier of Western Australia, who knows full well that if you rip up AWAs you throw a dagger at the heart of the resource industry in his state, you had Mr Hulls in Victoria being asked seven times to support the Leader of the Opposition's policy and he did not, and yesterday in the estimates committee the South Australian Premier was given ample opportunity to back the policy of the Leader of the Opposition of ripping up AWAs. He used 300 words in answering a simple question, but he failed to affirm in those 300 words that he supported the Leader of the Opposition's policy of ripping up AWAs. There is a particular South Australian reason for that, and that is that a very significant number, perhaps the majority, of the people employed at the Roxbury Downs mine are employed under individual contracts. That is the reason. I find that Premier a little errant on other issues - I do not want anybody to be under any misapprehension; he is errant on many of the issues that are important to Australia - but when it comes to the resource development of his own state, he knows darn well, as does Alan Carpenter, that ripping up AWAs would do enormous damage to the resource sector. In fact, the Australian Mines and Metals Association has found that abolishing AWAs will cost the mining industry $6 billion. We are dealing here with the one industry that, according to the opposition, is in fact responsible for the current wealth of Australia.In conclusion, and in reply to the member for Wakefield, alternative policies would greatly damage the economy of Australia, would increase unemployment, would reduce real wages growth and, overall, would be bad news for the workers of this country.</DOC>

 - What I made clear -  -  - is that the future arrangements between the component parts of Iraq is a matter for the people of Iraq. I know why the Labor Party does not like that assessment. It is because it invests democracy in the Iraqi people. It is for the people of Iraq to determine the future state of arrangements between the different provinces of Iraq. - That is not for us to decide, and it does not in any way alter the policy of the government. The policy of the government is not to hand Iraq over to terrorists and, more importantly, not to hand the terrorists an enormous propaganda victory. That is the essence of this debate. The Leader of the Opposition can ask as many questions as he likes about future constitutional arrangements, but I do know this: if we had followed the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, we would still have Saddam Hussein butchering people in Iraq. - That is the reality and, as far as the government is concerned, the Labor Party's policy would give an enormous boost to the terrorists -  - and do enormous long-term damage to the interests of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I can tell him that shortly before two o'clock today the Senate passed amendments to the trade practices law, which will mean that today is a great day for 1.2 million small businesses throughout Australia. These reforms will make it easier for small business to notify and collectively bargain. They will make it simpler and less costly. They will increase the powers of the ACCC, giving it the ability to search premises and seize evidence. These reforms will also increase fines for anti competitive behaviour so that the fine can be three times the economic gain a corporation could make through breaching the act.These reforms have been supported by all the significant small business organisations - for example, COSBOA, whose CEO, Tony Steven, said recently:The cooperation between the many sectors of small business and the government is at its highest level.Unfortunately, the Labor Party voted against these reforms twice in the House and twice in the Senate, and they brought truth to the claim of the Leader of the Opposition that the ALP has never claimed to be a party of small business. His 6PR claim that the ALP has never claimed to be part of small business has been borne out. - The Labor Party had plenty of opportunity to vote for small business, and it voted against these bills twice in the House and twice in the Senate. Labor is not the party of small business; Labor is the party of big unions and big union leaders. The World Bank's latest publication, Doing Business 2007, ranked Australia eighth out of 175 economies in the world for doing business. We were the second-best country in the world for the ease of starting a business, third for the ease of accessing credit, seventh for enforcing contracts and ninth for employing workers.I cannot let this opportunity go past without paying acknowledgement to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism for all the work she did in relation to these reforms; she did a fabulous job. I also acknowledge the wonderful work Senator Boswell did in the Senate and, indeed, the constructive work Senator Fielding did in getting the legislation through the Senate after 12 months of Labor Party delay - a great day for small business. - It is great to see the coalition again standing up for small business against the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. In acknowledging the member for Page, I acknowledge that it is his birthday today and I am sure the House congratulates the member for Page. I also note that the member for Page has indicated today that he is going to retire. We should recognise the great contribution he has made to government, both in his time in this House and as Deputy Speaker and in the state parliament of New South Wales, where he made a significant contribution, particularly during his time as minister.The member for Page has always been a great supporter of small businesses, the engine room and the backbone of regional Australia. The government's workplace reform packages, in a number of ways, have significantly strengthened the position of small business in our regional economies. First of all, and particularly in electorates like that of the member for Page, where both employees and employers are looking for flexible arrangements in the workplace to suit their lifestyle, that has delivered great improvements in productivity to small business people. But most importantly in the package was the abolition of the unfair dismissal aspects of the law so that no longer do small business have to confront the unfair dismissal laws that have dogged small business for the last 10 years or more. We have campaigned and campaigned on getting rid of those unfair dismissal laws, and at last we have done so. - The member for Hunter agrees with the government in getting rid of those unfair dismissal laws, so they have now gone. - Here is an interesting statistic: between March and September this year, the Australian economy generated 205,000 new jobs, many of which were in small businesses in regional Australia such as in the electorate of Page. By contrast, in the same period, what happened in the labour market in 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment? For the same period in 1992, the economy actually lost 15,000 jobs. So, this year, we gained 205,000 jobs but, then, they lost 15,000 jobs. We all know, as the Treasurer just pointed out - and it has been admitted by the Leader of the Opposition - that in July 2000 on 6PR radio in Perth, the Leader of the Opposition said:We have never pretended to be a small business party.The Labor Party continue to prove that again today. An important element of the reforms to the Trade Practices Act empowers small business to collectively bargain. It is something we have pursued for the past 12 months and that has been passed by the House and by the Senate. This is another legislative change that is going to strengthen the position of small business in our economy to help them create more jobs in the economy.</DOC>

 - In case the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten, the normal thing in a democracy is for the expression of the will of the people to be through its elected government. I am fascinated; I know the Leader of the Opposition is very poll driven. If I had taken notice of every opinion poll that I have read on certain issues over the last 10 years, I would not have pursued taxation reform. I know it was a free vote but I might have taken a different view on constitutional change. I might have taken a different view on the sale of Telstra. I might have taken a different view on a whole lot of things but, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I am not poll obsessed or poll driven. I am obsessed with the long-term welfare of the Australian people.I know that it is in the long-term interests of the Australian people not to give a victory to the terrorists. I happen to think it is important not to enliven JI in Indonesia. I do not want the leaders of JI running around saying, 'We forced the Americans, the Australians and the British out of Iraq.' I do not want them doing that because I think they might be able to use that argument as a recruitment weapon. I do not want young Indonesians joining JI; I want them remaining opposed to radical Islam and supporting moderate Islamic leaders like President Yudhoyono. It is plainly therefore not in our interests to do what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do. He can read all the opinion polls he likes. In the end, we will make our judgements based on the authentic expression of the democratically elected government of Iraq.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question and his support for the government's program. I can report to the House that it is true that the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported today that long-term unemployment in Australia has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded. Long-term unemployment fell from 89,900 people in August this year to 84,500 in September this year. Let me put that in context. At its peak in May 1993, long-term unemployment in Australia stood at 329,800 people.In other words, when the Leader of the Opposition was then the minister for employment, the last time he had some responsibility for running the economy in Australia, there were almost one-quarter of a million more Australians unemployed on a long-term basis than there are today. This is a massive reduction of almost one-quarter of a million in the number of unemployed in Australia. One could say that the member for Brand was hardly the minister for employment; he was, indeed, the minister for unemployment.Not only has the number of long-term unemployed fallen, according to the latest ABS data, but also the number of very long-term unemployed has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded. Indeed, it has fallen from 50,000 in August this year to 46,000 in September. As the Prime Minister and others have pointed out over the last six months, since the introduction of Work Choices we have seen the creation of 205,000 jobs in Australia. Importantly and significantly, 184,000 of those jobs are full-time jobs for Australians. This is good news for Australians. It shows that the government's policies in relation to Work Choices and in reforming Welfare to Work in this country have led to real outcomes for real Australians - that is, many more people now have a job and are able to provide for themselves and their families in a way they were not able to do before.In conclusion, I have to note that the Labor Party has opposed every reform that this government has attempted to put in place to bring about these results. Whether it be Work Choices, welfare reform or other reforms in Australia, the Labor Party has stood in the way of these reforms every time, yet we see today the real outcomes for Australians. What this shows, once again, is that it is only the Howard government - the coalition, this side of politics - which has the true interests of the Australian people and will bring about better conditions for Australian workers and their families.</DOC>

 - That is a very interesting question from the Leader of the Opposition, because the single most deadly act inspired by JI against Australia was the attack on 12 October 2002 in Bali -  - and that preceded by months the coalition operation in Iraq. So don't, the Leader of the Opposition, come into this place and start lecturing this side of the House about the threat of JI and terrorists. The terrorists struck and killed Australians in Indonesia long before the operation in Iraq. - The point I am making is: don't by our actions in Iraq in October 2006 give terrorists pause to feel triumphant. Don't give them a propaganda weapon. Don't allow them to go from one end of Indonesia to the other. Don't allow them to do it, because that is precisely what will happen if the advice of the Leader of the Opposition is followed. - But the Leader of the Opposition drew my attention to some comments of the head of the British army. He has made a number of comments about this issue, but let me draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention in the same context to the remarks made at a news conference today by the Iraqi oil minister, a man who has very high repute in Iraq, a man who suffered torture under Saddam Hussein. This is what he had to say:We expect the international community to stay with the Iraqi people in this war against international terrorism, because if these people are allowed to succeed, God forbid, in Iraq, then they will be a threat to the whole world.They are the views of an Iraqi minister. You can choose to ignore them, you can choose to wholly embrace them or you can try and put them into some kind of context. But quite plainly what this Iraqi minister is saying - a man who knows better than anybody in this House what it is like in Iraq - is that the terrorists would gain an enormous victory if we were to pull out. And that is our argument. I keep bringing the Leader of the Opposition back to this. - He can quote anybody he likes against me, but he has got to answer to the Australian people why he wants a policy that would give the terrorists, including terrorists in our own region, a psychological victory. Why do we want to give Jemaah Islamiah an additional recruiting weapon? Why do we want to encourage the terrorist groups in Indonesia to recruit more young Indonesians for the jihadist fight against us? That is the burden that lies upon the Leader of the Opposition and that is the obligation he has to explain to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question and his strong representation of his constituents in this place. As I said earlier, in the last six months we have seen the creation of 205,000 new jobs in Australia. To put that in its historical context, the average job creation for the same six months in Australia for the past 20 years was just 75,000 jobs. That is 75,000 jobs on average for the last 20 years. This year, after Work Choices came into operation, 205,000 jobs were created in this country. Not only have we seen the creation of more jobs; we have seen wages grow in Australia over the same period of time.The member asked me: are there any proposals that would cut wages and jobs in Australia? Indeed, I noticed that last week the ACTU released their blueprint for industrial relations in Australia, and this is a blueprint for economic vandalism of Australia. Make no mistake about it - this would lead to cutting wages for Australians because, when you look into the detail of this blueprint, what we find is that the ACTU intend to prohibit employers offering any inducements to workers to enter into agreements that do not involve a union.So that means that, if there is a demand by a number of workers in a place for a union collective agreement and that union collective agreement is put in place, the employer and proprietor of that business would be precluded under this ACTU blueprint from offering any worker in that business an individual contract which paid higher wages. So this is quite clearly a blueprint to drive down the wages of Australians if it were ever enacted in this country. It would drive down wages for hundreds of thousands of Australians in this country.We know that the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, said that it was a good idea when the unions ran the country, that it would be a good idea again if the unions ran the country. What we now know is that his idea of running the Australian economy would be to impose a union official on every workplace in Australia, to be able to demand the opening of the books of every business in Australia and to be able to effectively drive down the superior wages of many Australians in this country. We know that the Leader of the Opposition simply retains his job because the union movement in this country allows him to have it. The great shame in this country would be if he were ever elected and ever able to implement this blueprint, because it would be an economic disaster for Australians.</DOC>

 - This is an important and heartfelt question from the member for Gwydir. I have to say that I think that city people often find it hard to understand the mental suffering faced by farming families watching generations of hard work destroyed by drought.Australian farmers, as the member well knows, are a tough and resilient people but many of them are now under extreme pressure. Government cannot solve all the vagaries of climate and market. We cannot massage away all the griefs of the human condition but we can and must provide good services to people in need. In addition to the Regional Health Services, which the Commonwealth government funds in some 120 towns with fewer than 5,000 people, the government has recently announced a further $51 million to provide psychological services in smaller communities.We have just funded 17 new suicide prevention services in rural areas and we have just given another $18 million to Lifeline. Importantly, in June, beyondblue launched a new phone counselling service for rural men and this has already helped hundreds of men in areas affected by drought.Stoicism is an admirable trait, but not if it makes problems worse. Talking about problems will not make them go away but can certainly make them easier to cope with. Like the member for Gwydir, I certainly hope that farmers in country areas will not think that silence is strength, and they will not bottle up their problems until they are beyond help.</DOC>

I associate myself with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, but that is where the association abruptly terminates.I think, if we are talking about stitches, we can say that the last election saved 17 - not stitches but 17 per cent interest rates, which is the level to which housing interest rates soared under Labor governments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe. I am very happy to say that the Fair Pay Commission has been true to its name. It has been fair to the workers of Australia. Work Choices has been fair to the workers of Australia, and the increase of more than $27 a week that was brought down by the commission last Thursday represented the final nail in the coffin in relation to Labor's attack on our Work Choices legislation. They told us that there would be mass sackings. Since March 2006 we have had 205,000 more jobs. Instead of mass sackings we have had mass hirings.They told us there would be rolling industrial disputes. The fact is that the latest figures from the ABS show us that industrial disputes in Australia are at the lowest level since records began to be kept. Now, this is a result of a number of things, including Work Choices. Of course the greatest lie of all that came from the Labor Party and the union movement was that Work Choices was going to drive down wages. The Labor Party know a lot about driving down wages. When they were in government real wages actually fell. Since we have been in government real wages have risen by 16.4 per cent.Of course, they derided Professor Harper's commission. They call it the 'low pay commission', and I notice that the putative leader of the Labor Party, the national secretary of the AWU, is running around attacking the integrity of this independent body. Well, the Fair Pay Commission did the right thing. They did the fair thing by the workers of Australia, and that represents the final repudiation of this ludicrous, dishonest attack that has been made by the Labor Party and the union movement.They were wrong on employment, they were wrong on industrial disputes and they have been totally wrong on pay. I can say to the workers of Australia, 'Your future is safe with the coalition.'</DOC>

 - No, I will not confirm that, because the truth is the proper comparison is the proportion of income on a new mortgage, and it is lower now than it was when you had interest rates at 17 per cent. If you actually look at the figures and the claim being made by the Leader of the Opposition, he cannot escape the heavy burden that Keating and Beazley equals 17 per cent; Howard and Costello equals 7¾ per cent. That is the measure of the difference between the economic stewardship of this government and the economic stewardship of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. I would refer him today to an analysis published in the Australian by NATSEM, the Labor Party preferred modeller, because the analysis which is in the Australian today - done not by the government but by NATSEM - shows that couples with no children have seen their disposable income increase 23 per cent since the government came to office and couples with children have seen their disposable income increase 29 per cent since the coalition came to office. Looking at all families and singles, the overall increase in disposable income over the 10 years since 1996-97 has been 20 per cent, showing undoubtedly that this government has put in place real benefits in terms of increased disposable income for Australian families.Ann Harding, writing in the Australian today, says that the real spending power of a single aged pensioner has increased nearly a quarter since 1996-97. She says:This growth in income has been driven by a liberalisation of the pension income test, the introduction of special tax concessions for seniors and increases in the pension rate.Again I quote Ann Harding, the Labor Party's preferred modeller:And this bonanza for seniors with some private resources does not include the additional benefits bestowed by the introduction of the special subsidised rate for pharmaceuticals for self-funded retirees in 1999.There we have the analysis by NATSEM. Families have increased their disposable income, singles have increased their disposable income and seniors that have some additional income have had a 25 per cent increase in spending power - and that is not including the extension of pharmaceutical benefits to those with the Commonwealth seniors health card. What this proves is that with sound economic reform, with 1.9 million more jobs in this country and with improvements to the taxation system - all of which were opposed by the Labor Party - those that needed help in Australia have been given help, and it is only a coalition government that has the capacity to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question and particularly his interest in this matter and his representation of the working families in his area. He would be well aware that under our workplace reforms we have seen unemployment in Australia drop to 4.8 per cent across the nation. In historical levels, it has not been in this area for over 30 years. The member for Hume would also be aware that unemployment across his electorate averaged 3.9 per cent, which is a great achievement in a regional part of New South Wales. So there is a 4.8 per cent average across the nation and 3.9 per cent in the electorate of Hume. We should recall that it was 5.9 per cent in 1996, so it has come down two per cent in the life of the coalition government in the electorate of Hume.The small area labour market figures show that over 60 per cent of regions recorded a fall in their unemployment rate over the past 12 months, and 60 per cent of areas have unemployment rates of less than five per cent. So regional Australia is sharing in the benefits of the changes and reforms that we have introduced across Australia that have seen levels of unemployment drop dramatically in those labour markets. It is very important that regional Australia continues to share in the prosperity of the nation. Since Work Choices was introduced in March of this year there have been 205,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy, many of those in regional Australia and many of them in the member for Hume's electorate. We should recognise that.Many regional Australians welcomed last week's decision by the Australian Fair Pay Commission to award a $27 a week pay rise to low-paid workers. On average, a lot of the workforce and working families in regional Australia are on those basic wages and they will receive this benefit on 1 December this year. They welcome it. They also welcome the fact that it has proven the lie of the Labor Party's fearmongering over Work Choices and the fearmongering that they have put out there that the establishment of the Fair Pay Commission would not deliver for workers. It has.AWU boss, Bill Shorten, who aspires to sit in the seat over here occupied by the current Leader of the Opposition, could not bring himself to acknowledge that it was a good outcome. He said:... it is wrong if they only get an extra payment because a Federal Election will be held in 12 months.It has got nothing to do with a federal election. Ian Harper and the Fair Pay Commission brought this ruling down because they believe these workers deserve that rise; they do and they have been rewarded for that.We know all about the union movement's comments in support of the Labor Party's campaign to try and win office next year. Greg Combet said that the unions used to run Australia and it would be a good thing if they did that again. Then there was that famous comment of ACTU President Sharan Burrow, when Work Choices was first announced. She said:I need a mum or dad of someone who's been seriously injured or killed. That would be fantastic.That is what Sharan Burrow had to say. We know what Greg Combet had to say. We have just seen what Bill Shorten has had to say. These are the people that control the Labor Party and want to put Australia back in the hands of the union movement.</DOC>

 - I do stand by what I said yesterday. When the Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government, interest rates for housing hit 17 per cent. I cannot remember when interest rates for housing went higher than 17 per cent. - It is also the case that since this government has been in office both inflation and interest rates have, by historic standards, been low and they will remain so. The Australian people know that interest rates and, might I say, inflation will always be lower under a coalition government than a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question and I say to him and to the members of the House that last Thursday was a great news day for Australian workers. More than one million award-reliant low-paid Australians know that from 1 December of this year they will be taking home more money in their pay packets - for some one million Australians, a $27 increase in their minimum wages. Prior to last Thursday, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Perth and other members of the Australian Labor Party had been running around this country for the past year or so seeking to blacken the reputation of the Australian Fair Pay Commission by saying that this Fair Pay Commission would drive down the wages of ordinary Australian workers. They went around this country, day after day and week after week, seeking to traduce the reputation of the Fair Pay Commission before it had even given a decision.In the light of that, I was very interested to look at what the Leader of the Opposition would say about this decision on Thursday. I kept my ears tuned to the radio, watched the television and looked at the wire services - I even went to the website - and I could not find a thing. Do you know that the Leader of the Opposition - having spent 12 months seeking to say that this would drive down the wages of ordinary Australians when, in fact, the Fair Pay Commission came out with a $27 increase - had absolutely nothing to say? There was dead silence from the Leader of the Opposition about this decision. He could not bring himself to say that this was a great decision for the workers of Australia, yet he sits in here each day pretending that somehow he and his party are the representatives of the workers in this country.After Mr Combet came out and said, 'On one hand this is a good decision, but, on the other hand, of course, we would still abolish the Fair Pay Commission that gave this good decision,' the next day we had the Leader of the Opposition out there saying, 'We will abolish the Fair Pay Commission.' More roll back, more rip up. Rip up AWAs that deliver higher wages, roll back and rip up the Fair Pay Commission that delivers a $27 a week increase to the low-paid workers in Australia and even rip up the Office of Workplace Services, which has collected more than $30 million in underpaid wages for the workers of Australia.You have to ask: why is this the policy of the Leader of the Opposition - to reintroduce an outdated and adversarial process for industrial relations that would take us back to the 1980s in Australia? There can only be one answer and that is that the Leader of the Opposition is only interested in shoring up the $70 million worth of cash that flows from the unions in this country to the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. The reaction of the Leader of the Opposition last week and this whole campaign from the ALP proves once again that they are not fit to govern this country and they are not fit to manage this economy. The reality is that this party - the coalition - remains the workers' best friend in Australia.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Lilley that I always check figures quoted by the opposition. - The problem is that the member for Lilley is too friendly with the member for Perth. The member for Perth has not got a figure right yet when it has come to industrial relations. In relation to the wellbeing of the people of Australia, by any measure the Australian people are much better off under this government. - They are far better off. When Labor were last in government, they drove down their wages. When Labor were last in government, they lifted housing interest rates to 17 per cent. When this country had an unemployment rate of about eight per cent, the now Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, said, 'You can't really get it any better than that.' He gave up on the unemployed. In the time that we have been in government we have been able to get unemployment down to a 30-year low and there is no greater measure of the wellbeing of the Australian people than the ease with which they can win not only employment but also significant increases in their wages. Under this government, we have had an increase in wages of 16.4 per cent in 10½ years versus minus three per cent in 13½ years. We are now at a 30-year low in unemployment. Whilst, as always, I will check the figures of the member for Lilley, by any measure the Australian people are better off now than they were 10 years ago, and they are better off because of the enormous contribution the men and women of this country have made to the growth, wealth and production of Australia.One of the reasons they have made that contribution is that they have had a government that has cared for them, they have had a government that believes in incentives, they have had a government that has reduced interest rates from the absolutely Himalayan levels that they reached under the former government but, above all, they have had a government that believes in the hopes and the aspirations of the Australian people. That has been behind our commitment to industrial relations reform. We have always been about fairness and flexibility, unlike the Labor Party that has always taken the view that it knows what is best for people. It said that for 13 years. I can say without fear of contradiction that the workers of Australia did not think it was best for them that their real wages fell in that 13-year period of Labor government.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and her interest. The Yemeni authorities have confirmed that they have arrested a number of people whom they suspect of having been involved with terrorist activities. In the broad, we welcome the determination by Yemeni authorities to address terrorism. This is a country where there have been a number of terrorist attacks over the years - most prominently the attack on the USS Cole but also there have been attacks that Australians have been caught up in over the years.Amongst those who have been arrested are three Australians, who were among a group. There were not four as has been suggested by some but three. Two of those Australians were born in Australia and one of them was born in Poland and became an Australian citizen during the 1980s. We do not have any confirmation of the official charges at this stage, but we understand that the men were detained on terrorist charges, including attempting to smuggle arms to Somalia. These are very serious charges and the government, of course, would be deeply concerned if it turns out that they are true.In spite of this, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as usual, will provide normal consular assistance to those who have been arrested. We will monitor the welfare of those people and we will assist them to ensure that they have access to lawyers and to an appropriate judicial process. The British Embassy in Yemen is giving assistance - we do not have an embassy in Yemen - and officers from the Australian Embassy in Riyadh will continue to seek access to those Australians who have been detained. Finally, the department is in constant contact, as the House would expect, with the next of kin both here and in Yemen.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his very strong support of the Australian men and women who wear our Defence uniform. At the moment, the Australian Defence Force is deployed in 10 locations throughout the world. Four of those locations are quite significant at the least, and they include Afghanistan and Iraq. In Afghanistan at the moment our troops are based predominantly at Tarin Kowt in the province of Uruzgan in southern central Afghanistan. Some 400 are based there and, of those, 270 are tradesmen and women and engineers who are involved in reconstructing roads and water projects, helping with hospital programs and providing a range of trade training activities for the Afghan people. We are working in partnership with the Dutch who are based at Tarin Kowt. The Dutch are with us under the NATO forces; they have around 1,400 soldiers who are working alongside us.We also have at Tarin Kowt a company of 120 soldiers, supported by infantry mobility vehicles. Australians may not appreciate it but at Kandahar in Afghanistan are two Chinook helicopters supported by 110 Army personnel. Every Australian should be very proud of the work they are doing not only in engaging in aeromedical evacuation of the injured in the confrontations that are occurring with the Taliban but also in their in efforts in getting our troops to where they need to be and in getting them out in times of emergency.We currently have 1,400 troops - sailors, airmen and women - across Iraq. Of those, 110 are based in Baghdad, with their light armoured vehicles, and they are providing essential security for our diplomats and officials as they move through the streets of Baghdad. Also, 80 of our people are working in the headquarters in Baghdad, along with our key allies and the Iraqis themselves. Two P3C Orions are based in Iraq, and they have flown 8,000 hours. They provide essential surveillance and information that supports the ground forces - the Iraqi, Australian and coalition forces. Our two C130 Hercules, supported by 150 of our airmen and women, have now flown 1,100 missions. They have carried over two million kilograms of cargo and are essential to the effort.In the North Arabian Gulf at the moment is HMAS Warramunga, with 180 of its crew. Along with 10 other coalition ships, it is providing essential security and support to two Iraqi oil terminals - Australians should appreciate that oil is responsible for 90 per cent of Iraq's export income. Then in Tallil 500 of our soldiers are looking after overwatch in two provinces: Al Muthanna, which transferred to the Iraqi provincial control in July this year, and Dekar, which transferred only a few weeks ago. It is important to appreciate that that battle group is in constant dialogue with the provincial government in those two provinces - we have trained almost 200 of the Iraqi security forces in that area - and provides constant support to the tribal leaders and engagement with them.The parliament should remember what the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq said in Washington to the Congress, when he was there at the end of July. This is about the work that Australians have done. He said:I am proud to witness a historic milestone in new Iraq. Al-Muthanna just became the first province to assume complete responsibility for its law enforcement and security_            _            _This is a crucial first step in a sequence of events ultimately leading to Iraq standing entirely on its own.That is what this is about. Afghanistan and Iraq and in other places where we send our troops is about helping people to stand on their own and to project our force always with a kind heart.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. What has happened in relation to those groundwater entitlements is that the federal government has provided money under the general umbrella of structural adjustment. The actual compensation is something that falls upon the withdrawing level of government, and the withdrawing level of government, as the member will know, is the state government. At the moment, the negotiation that is taking place is about the taxation status of the payments. There is no argument about the willingness of the federal government to help in structural adjustment. The argument is that -  - If the member for New England is patient, he will find out that we are both broadly on the same side. The difficulty that we have is that the way in which the payments have been cast by the New South Wales government attracts a certain taxation treatment. We have suggested to the New South Wales government, without in any way wishing to engage in anything that is other than totally transparent, that if the payments were couched in the nature of compensation, which they plainly are, then a different and more beneficial taxation treatment would accrue. Thus far, as I understand it, the New South Wales government has been resistant to that, because they do not want to acknowledge that if you take something from somebody you ought to compensate them.But I do thank the member for New England for asking me this question. It enables me to say to the parliament and to say particularly to the people who are affected that I think it is absolutely outrageous what is now happening in parts of New South Wales concerning water entitlements. I spoke with somebody near Finley on Friday who had paid $30,000 on the Friday to buy water on the private market, and that water entitlement had been taken away or reduced by the New South Wales government on the following Monday without any compensation.I know of another case, where a man - I think his name was Pat Kennedy - was paid a $100,000 interest rate subsidy by the federal government under our interest rate EC subsidy scheme, where we pay the first 50 per cent of the interest in the first year of EC and then 80 per cent in the second and subsequent years. This man had received a $100,000 subsidy from the federal government. He was then required to pay $70,000 out of that $100,000 in, effectively, water rates, but he has no water because that water entitlement has been taken away. You cannot do that in the federal government because of the just compensation clause in the federal Constitution, and rightly so.I thank the member for New England for raising this issue. I am deeply grateful to the member for New England for raising this issue because under the federal Constitution if you take somebody's property without just compensation it is unconstitutional, but state governments are not bound by that kind of restraint. Let me make it very plain. - Something in the order of 95 per cent -  - of the financial burden of exceptional circumstances is borne, rightly, by the federal government, and we don't complain, but it is about time the New South Wales government did their bit. It is about time the New South Wales government stopped charging people in New South Wales for water they do not have. I can understand them, in a drought, cutting the allocation, but it is unconscionable, it is unfair and it is unjust that they should cut somebody's allocation without compensating.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest. There were some serious security developments in East Timor over the last week. The international forces, led by Brigadier Rerden, and the United Nations police have brought the situation under control. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Australian Defence Force and the international security forces as well as the UN Police because it is dangerous and difficult work that they have had to do. As at lunchtime today the situation in Dili was calm, but there is still an underlying tension. The unrest was caused by clashes between rival gangs near the airport and in other isolated pockets around Dili. We are concerned that this violence may be organised in some instances for what might broadly be described as political reasons. The timing of the violence could be linked to the release on 17 October of a report by the United Nations Special Commission recommending action be taken against a number of people whom the UN believe to have been responsible for the violence that took place in April and May.I am able to confirm reports that at least six people have been killed and another 50 have been injured since last Wednesday and note with concern reports that drugs have been used to fuel gang violence. I welcome the commitment by the United Nations Police to investigate this matter. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully and keep our travel advisory under constant review. At the moment it advises Australians to reconsider their need to travel to East Timor, at least for the time being, because of the uncertain security situation.There are around 1,000 Australian troops in East Timor. As I have said, they are doing an excellent job to keep violence under control. Any suggestion that the Australian troops have been anything less than professional and impartial in carrying out their duties is wrong, and it is ludicrous. I welcome the consensus decision by the United Nations Security Council last Friday that Australia should continue to lead the international security forces in East Timor. That decision by the Security Council is consistent with the preferred position of the Australian government. I also note that last Friday East Timor's Prime Minister, Jose Ramos Horta, reaffirmed his government's total support for the work being done by Australian troops in restoring law and order. He said it was 'logical and necessary' that East Timor accept the assistance of its neighbours in providing troops to stabilise its security and that that was - and I quote him again - 'in the best interests' of East Timor. So we will remain committed to the task in East Timor through to the general elections, which are scheduled to be in May 2007 and, no doubt, beyond.</DOC>

 - The position of the government in relation to this is that of course climate change is occurring.  -  
 - Of course it is occurring. Self-evidently, climate change is occurring. I await with interest the full report of Sir Nicholas Stern, but from preliminary reports - and also analysis of those preliminary reports by the ever-vigilant member for Lilley - we know a number of things. We know first and foremost that you need to have a variety of responses to climate change. I would imagine that, if you need a variety of responses, one of the responses has to include a sensible examination of the nuclear power alternative.Equally, Sir Nicholas, I understand - and this is self-evident - says that you cannot have a solution that does not involve in an effective way all of the international polluters. And I noticed that this was picked up. I impose a harsh discipline on myself of a morning, but one of the things I did this morning was to listen to the member for Lilley. Having said that, I have to make my peace with my colleague the Treasurer. I listened very carefully to the member for Lilley and he had a remarkable statement to make. He said it is very important for everybody to be part of the solution - countries like China and India had to be part of the solution - and, therefore, he was very disappointed that Australia had not ratified the Kyoto protocol. What he did not go on to acknowledge was that China and India, although being part of Kyoto, do not carry the same burden under Kyoto that Australia carries. That is the reason why, until that changes, this country will not join Kyoto, because, unless you have everybody in, you are not going to have a solution to the problem. I am not going to sign up to something that imposes burdens on my country that are not imposed on our competitors. That is the reason. Of course if you could reach an agreement that had the involvement of China, the involvement of the United States and the involvement of India, you would begin to find the basis of a worldwide approach to this problem, but, until you get all of them involved, you are not going to find a solution to this problem. - I was asked about a number of things, including Sir Nicholas Stern. I am just telling the member for Lilley that he is right, Sir Nicholas is right and everybody is right if they say the answer to this issue is to have all the polluters involved - and that is the reason why we have held back from Kyoto. And, unlike most of the European countries, we are going to either meet or go very near to meeting our Kyoto target. I have not only read the reports of the Nicholas Stern review; I have also read an article in the Guardian - it is quite a strain for me to read the Guardian, but I have nonetheless done it - and what that article indicates is that most of the sermonisers and the lecturers on this issue, namely many of the European countries, are falling a long way short of their Kyoto targets. Despite being in many cases 50 per cent short of their targets, they are the people who are running around the world giving us a lecture. Australia will meet or go very close to meeting her target, and we will continue to hold out for an international agreement that includes everybody, because that is the only fair basis on which Australia can be included.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I acknowledge his interest in this matter and I recognise his role and that of the member for Flinders, the member for Greenway, the member for Bowman and other government members in supporting an announcement that the Prime Minister was able to make yesterday. The Australian government has announced a new initiative to establish chaplaincy programs in schools across Australia. Schools will be able to access funding to establish chaplain positions to provide greater pastoral care and support for the spiritual wellbeing of students. Currently, a number of schools in a number of states have chaplaincy services and the school chaplains are making a very valuable contribution to those school communities. But this is only available in some states.The Australian government is determined to ensure that all schools, government and non-government, in all states are able to have access to chaplaincy services if that is what they choose to do, and we have provided funding of some $90 million over three years to support this program. The program will be voluntary in that schools will be able to choose whether they wish to take part. We would expect that schools will consult widely with their broader school communities and they will make the decision as to who would fill a chaplaincy role.At present, the chaplaincy service is available in a number of states. I will be writing to all state and territory education ministers to ask for their support and we will be developing national guidelines that will be available by the end of the year. Regrettably, the New South Wales government has banned the establishment of chaplain positions in New South Wales government schools. I acknowledge the broad support from the member for Jagajaga for this proposal and I would ask that she join with me in calling on the Iemma government to lift its ban on the establishment of chaplaincy positions in government schools. We want to ensure that all schools across Australia in all states have the choice and the opportunity to engage chaplaincy services if they wish to do so.</DOC>

 - I probably did say something like that. If I did not say it I will say it now. I think it is very important though that, as in all of these things, we do not zealously embrace a particular report or a particular piece of analysis. Of course climate change is occurring. 
Opposition members - Oh! - A chorus of approval from the opposition! Dear me, I get a chorus of approval from the opposition! - Let me simply say to the member for Grayndler that climate change of course is occurring and the challenge that he has - the challenge that anybody in this parliament that wants to address this thing sensibly has - is to work out the right range of policies to respond with. -  - Exactly! The first and most important thing you do when you respond to something is you do not close your mind to one important option. - And the important option that the Labor Party has already closed its mind to is of course nuclear power. I am not saying that nuclear power is one solution to this; I do not believe that for a moment. Nor do I believe that solar and wind power represent the sole solution to this problem. You need, in my view, a contribution from renewables, and last week the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources announced a major project that could represent one of the biggest investments in solar power generation in the world. This was announced in concert with the Victorian government, and today in Queensland the minister announced a number of other projects funded by the federal government that are investing in new technologies which are designed to reduce the greenhouse gas impact of the use of fossil fuels. At the moment it is undoubtedly the case that the cheapest source of energy is what is colloquially called 'dirty coal'. If we just went on using that, we would win the economic debate -  - I am only saying things that the bloke sitting on your right has said, because on this issue the member for Batman speaks a great deal of sense - the member for Batman is on the money. If the member for Batman had the restraints taken off him, he would be on board in relation to nuclear power. And I can tell by the way he laughs and grins that deep down Martin is in the nuclear camp - I know that. I know Martin: if you trawl around enough, you will find Martin and a bit of enriched uranium sitting side by side.So what you really need in this debate is to have a multiplicity of responses. You do not want to get too theological about it; you want a multiplicity of responses. You will never be able to generate baseload power using solar and wind; you can make a contribution at the margins, you can help in peak hours but you will never be able to generate baseload. The only things that will ever replace the current dirty power stations are cleaner uses of fossil fuel, or nuclear power. You will never replace them with solar or wind. - Let me say to the member for Grayndler I rather welcome this debate, because quite plainly what this country needs is a very full debate. It needs a debate that has every option on the table. We do not want closed minds like that of the member for Grayndler. We want the open, expansive, embracing approach of the member for Batman. On this issue the member for Batman has more wisdom than the member for Grayndler because the member for Batman will look at all of the options - and that is certainly in Australia's longer term interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and for his very strong support of low-emissions technologies, particularly in the area of renewable energy. In fact, I understand that the Mildura and Swan Hill rural city councils have sought to be the solar power municipalities of the world. Taken with last week's announcement of the biggest solar energy generator in the world being built in Mallee, it shows the way is being led by this government. The inconvenient truth for those who sit opposite is that this government -  -  -  - You've been warned! The inconvenient truth for the member for Grayndler is this: this government has a very, very well-developed set of policies to lower greenhouse gas emissions. They like to think that we are not doing anything, but 2½ years ago we announced the energy white paper and in that white paper there was a whole suite of programs to ensure that this government led the way in terms of lowering emissions.Last week we announced a $75 million grant for the Solar Systems project that is going to be in the member for Mallee's seat and, along with that, a $50 million grant for the clean coal project at the Hazelwood power station. These projects involve world-leading technology. This morning I announced a further $125 million for two low-emission projects in Queensland: $75 million for a coal seam methane plant in the member for Maranoa's electorate, where CO emissions will be captured and injected back into the coal seam, and $50 million for a world's first project to retrofit a Central Queensland power station - in the member for Capricornia's electorate, if she is interested - to use oxyfuel technology. With all four projects put together, this is $250 million worth of government funding and $1.5 billion worth of investment by industry, and millions of tonnes of CO will be saved and geosequestered. We will lead the world in a number of those technologies, and I make the point -  - that these projects would not have happened without this government's policy that was laid out 2½ years ago and funded two budgets ago.The member for Grayndler then left the chamber. - We know you are on our side, Martin. Dave Holland from Solar Systems said:The Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund is a key ingredient in accelerating our progress to very large scale, mainstream solar power generation. Without this federal funding, we would not be able to make this project happen.What this clearly demonstrates is that it is not taxes and targets that deliver low emissions but technology - and it is this government that is investing in that technology.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and also for meeting us up at Mimili in the APY lands over the weekend, where we opened a new swimming pool. The No School, No Pool federal government policy is operating there, resulting, the principal tells me, in over 80 per cent child attendance at the school - which is a great step forward. I want to congratulate the principal for the strong leadership he is showing in that community, using this Commonwealth funded pool to have good health outcomes and good educational outcomes for the children in the APY. While we were up there, I also announced that the federal government would extend another $2.5 million to roll out a total of three pools in the region because of the success that has been demonstrated by the Mimili community.At the same time, the unfortunate reality is that there have been young people who have succumbed to substance abuse in that region, as they have in other parts of Australia, so we have extended by $1.1 million the rehabilitation facility. This brings to a total of $3.3 million the Commonwealth expenditure for rehabilitation and for housing of appropriate staff in that region so that these people can stay where they are, be fully rehabilitated and become active members of their community.Earlier on Saturday I was over the border in the Northern Territory, also in Pitjantjatjara lands, in the community of Mutitjulu, where I opened the new police station. This involved almost $2 million of Commonwealth funding. We all understand in this place that policing is a state and territory responsibility, but the reality is that the Territory has a lot of areas that do not have sufficient numbers of police. So the federal government, after being requested by the Territory government to be involved, came to the party. I think it is worth reminding the House where the request originally came from. It was back in 2004 that negotiations got under way which ultimately saw this police station being opened yesterday. Back then the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, wrote this about the Mutitjulu community in a memo of 26 November to her police minister:Social dysfunction surrounding the substance abuse epidemic is resulting in significant human rights abuses: self-harm, violence against others, sexual abuse and child neglect. Children as young as five have contracted STDs, and young girls are being prostituted for petrol. Two-thirds of young children are malnourished and underdeveloped.That is an intolerable situation in any Australian community. The federal government recognises that and will work in a collaborative and positive way with any state and territory government to stamp out that sort of abuse of young Australians. The Mutitjulu Police Station will go some way towards rectifying that problem.I will add that what disappoints me is that the two police officers are Aboriginal community police officers; they are not sworn police officers. They have had nine weeks training. That means they have come straight from training to a very difficult post. I would encourage the Northern Territory government to reconsider that and acknowledge that normal police practice is to put young constables, who are on probation, who are sworn constables, with senior, experienced people. That is not occurring there and I think it is absolutely paramount that we assist these young people, who I have met and who I think are of the highest possible calibre, to be able to do their job by having the benefit of having experienced police officers with them.There is much more to be done. The federal government has committed $130 million from the summit into sexual violence and abuse in these remote communities. We want to see a better future for Aboriginal children, men and women in these remote communities, and we have put the money on the table to make that a reality.</DOC>

 - As I explained to the House last night, if there has been any breach of the Australian regulations or the UN sanctions then that is a matter to be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. I am not going into the details of what it is - I do not want to compromise the inquiry. The Labor Party making a political point is fair enough, I suppose, to compromise the inquiry, is it? Only a fool would compromise the inquiry. I am not proposing to do that and I am not going into any of the details in relation to that particular investigation. It is a matter for the Federal Police.</DOC>

 - The government, like many in the Australian community, has condemned very strongly the comments make by Sheikh Taj al-Din al-Hilali about women, particularly about sexual assault and religious conflict. The comments, as far as the government is concerned, are unacceptable. They have no place in our society. His comments on jihad in particular contradict what we are told are the basic philosophies and essence of everything for which Islam stands. Those who ask for tolerance from others, in our view, should show the same tolerance themselves.The sheikh's views on women are not shared by the majority of the Muslim community, and many prominent Australian Muslims, including many women, have spoken out strongly against his views. This is a matter that needs to be addressed by his community, and I am pleased at the efforts that have been made thus far, but I think they still have some way to go. This, of course, is not the first time that comments made by the sheikh have created concern in the Australian community. It is disappointing that this issue was not dealt with properly in the 1980s and 1990s, when similarly divisive and controversial statements were made. It was then open to the government to deal with this matter when the sheikh's application for permanent residency was made in the 1980s.The then immigration minister, Chris Hurford, considered that application and did not approve it. However, this decision, as he has made clear, was overturned by one of his successors. That happened after the intervention of senior Labor ministers, including the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who acknowledged in this chamber on 18 September 1990 that he had made representations on the sheikh's behalf. I raised the matter at that time, as I might say did the member for Mitchell, who has had a very considerable concern about these issues over a long time. I was criticised roundly by Labor ministers at that time for raising it.Interestingly, in 2003 in the Adelaide Review Mr Hurford explained his decision to reject this application. He said it was based on the sheikh's lengthy history of inflaming divisions in the community. Mr Hurford went on to tell the Australian that he believed residency was granted because the Labor government 'erroneously believed this would have some political influence in particular electorates at the New South Wales state election'. That was Chris Hurford's view. Labor knew there was a problem then and they chose to ignore it.The opposition leader's response on the Sunday program - that we have to live with it - avoids very clearly the responsibility that he and his colleagues had. This incident has divided the Muslim community, and it has not been helpful to relations between Australian Muslims and the rest of the community. Australia is a tolerant and multicultural society and there is room for all religions, but people who live here must respect the rule of law and Australian values.</DOC>

We prefer the professional legal advice of our distinguished legal advisers to that of the library. - I simply reiterate the point that this government believes that a privatised Medibank Private will be good for the health sector, will be good for the policyholders and will generally put downward pressure on premiums. We believe - along with the CEO of the NIB fund, Mr Mark Fitzgerald - that this is a very good policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. The Reserve Bank today released its monthly credit series, showing that credit remained stable in the month of September. Total private sector credit - comprising housing, personal and business credit - increased one per cent and was 14.4 per cent higher over the year, unchanged from August. Household sector credit - comprising household and personal credit - rose one per cent in September and housing credit rose one per cent to be 14.2 per cent higher than at the same time last year, unchanged from the growth rate in August. Housing credit growth at 14.2 per cent is significantly lower than the growth that we saw in 2004 when housing credit growth was up around 21 per cent. So, although credit growth is quite strong, it is certainly not at the peaks that it was before the readjustment in the housing cycle back in 2004.One of the things that is supporting decent credit growth in this country is employment. There are 1.9 million additional Australians who have work compared to when the Labor Party was last in office. It is undoubtedly the case that that has given people the confidence to take out credit, because they are confident of their employment prospects under a coalition government. Your chances of getting a job were significantly lower under the Labor Party, which put so many people out of work. - I believe it is the member for Blaxland who is interjecting. After all, it was his boss, Mr Keating, who presided over all those people who were put out of work. - The Labor Party did not care about people who were put out of work in the late eighties and nineties, because the Labor Party increased unemployment. The Labor Party never had an unemployment rate with a four in front of it. - The Labor Party loved the unemployed so much they kept creating more of them. They got the unemployment rate up to 10 and 11 per cent under their predecessor, the boss of the member for Blaxland. It is the coalition that stands for jobs for working people. It is the coalition that stood up to give the working people of this country a go at a job. It is good economic policy, because this is the party that cares for the working people of Australia.</DOC>

 - It is true that the Stern review, apart from analysing the climate change that is occurring and projecting the likely outcomes, recommends that there be concerted, combined and comprehensive international action to challenge this issue. That is a recommendation that the government wholeheartedly endorses. Let me simply say, however, that in pursuing that objective we will make certain that the natural advantages this country has been given by providence are not squandered. One of the great natural advantages this country has is that we are a major possessor, user and exporter of fossil fuels. It therefore follows that, if we are not careful in the implementation of our policies in relation to this issue, not only can we do great damage to our own economy but, in the process, we will not serve the interests of those who live in other countries. We do as a country have an obligation as part of the international community to play our role.I might mention that, in pursuit of the greenhouse gas emission target set by Kyoto, this country is doing better than most industrialised countries. It is very interesting that some of the countries that presume to lecture Australia are in fact far less likely than Australia to meet their Kyoto targets. The reason why we have not signed, and will not sign, Kyoto in its present form is that it does not comprehensively embrace all of the world's major emitters. - You cannot have an effective response to global warming unless you have all of the culprits in the net. As you know, Kyoto does not impose the obligations it would have imposed on Australia on countries like China and India. The United States is not a member of Kyoto and, if my quick mathematics is correct, if you add the United States, India and China together, you have virtually half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. How on earth can an agreement that does not embrace almost half of the world's emitters be the answer? It plainly is not the answer, and that is why we have not signed it. And there is another reason why we have not signed - that is, if we signed it in its present form -  - we would be assuming obligations that are not even imposed on countries like China and India. As Prime Minister, I am not going to take decisions that will put at risk the jobs and the investments associated with the natural advantages this country enjoys. Others may choose to do that, but while I am Prime Minister of this country I am not going to betray the natural advantages this country has. I am not going to betray those associated with the resource industry. What I am going to say to them is that the path ahead -  - is to develop alternatives to the use of fossil fuel - alternatives that involve everybody sharing the burden and not placing an unfair burden on the industries of Australia. There is nothing in the Stern report - and I have read the executive summary; I do not pretend to have read the 700 pages - that is contrary to what I am saying, because in the end you will not solve this problem until you get an effective international agreement. Kyoto was never an effective international agreement and that is why we did not sign it, but we are committed to working with other countries and we are very active in trying to achieve an agreement that does include everybody. The other thing I have to say is that the response to the problem is multifaceted. We clearly need to invest more in technologies to clean up coal, we clearly need to invest in renewables and we clearly need to look at the nuclear option. - Let me conclude my answer by quoting from somebody else. When I read this at the beginning of the year, it struck me as eminent common sense, and I would like to share with the House these words, which I think really encapsulate the issue very well:Those who hope to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and wave power need to come to terms with the reality that renewable energies, while they have an important and growing role to play, can't provide affordable and continuous base load energy.Abandoning traditional base load power in favour of renewables would result in an indefinite global depression, condemning hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people to starvation.This contribution to the debate ends with the words:Uranium is the other option for base load energy.Those words are very similar to what I have been saying as a contribution to this debate over the past weeks. They neatly encapsulate the common sense. They are the words of somebody who cares about the working men and women of Australia. They were the words of none other than the member for Batman on 26 January 2006.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for his question and, obviously, for his longstanding interest in the whole issue of climate change. What the Stern review is helping to focus the public mind on is the fact that the only solution to the climate change issue is going to be a comprehensive and global solution. That can be illustrated with a simple statistic. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, ABARE, Australia produces about 1.6 per cent of global emissions and China, 15 per cent, but by 2050 Australia's share will have dropped to 1.1 per cent and China's will have increased to nearly 27 per cent.Those statistics make it perfectly clear that the great challenge in addressing the climate change issue is to engage countries like China, India and also, by the way, Brazil to ensure that these major developing country emitters are part of the solution to the problem. It cannot be solved without engaging them. Of course, the Labor Party cries, 'Kyoto, Kyoto, Kyoto.' What does ABARE say about Kyoto? ABARE says that, without the Kyoto protocol, greenhouse emissions during the commitment period, 1990 to 2008-12, would have increased by 41 per cent, but if every single country which has targets under Kyoto and has ratified Kyoto achieves those targets - and, as the Prime Minister has said, many of them are way over those targets - then those emissions would not grow by 41 per cent but by 40 per cent.For the Labor Party to go out and try to convince the Australian public that Kyoto is an answer to the climate change issue is completely misleading. It is more than misleading; it is false. What this government is doing is working on making sure that we engage the major emitters. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which had its inaugural meeting in Sydney in January, includes China, India, the United States of America, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. This is about 50 per cent of the global GDP and it is about 50 per cent of global emissions, and most of these countries - there are a couple of exceptions there - are not making any commitment under Kyoto.This is an enormously important development. We will have more to say about it as the week wears on. The fact that we will have more to say about it I know will interest the Labor Party. The Labor Party has bagged this initiative from the word go. The honest truth of this is that the Labor Party's preferred option is Kyoto, which excludes China, India and Brazil - and the United States of course - from making any commitments. Our preferred option -  - Of course, not wishing to disparage anything else, our preferred option is the Asia-Pacific partnership - AP6. Finally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has a meeting next week in Nairobi. At that meeting there will be a discussion about how we are going to address, as an international community, the second commitment period. This is what Sir Nicholas Stern and others are interested in. Australia will be fully engaged in that meeting, but we will be engaged on the basis that we have always been engaged - that is, that we get the major emitters to make a contribution and a commitment. That is the basis on which we are engaged, not on some phoney political stunt which misleads people on solving the problem of climate change. The Labor Party know their policy is a policy of stunts, not of substance.</DOC>

 - The answer is that I do broadly remember those statements. It does not in any way alter the substance of this debate. The substance of this debate is whether in fact ratifying the Kyoto protocol -  - Sure, Australia signed the original Kyoto protocol, but we never ratified it. The reason we never ratified it is that -  -  - There are two reasons why, above others, the government did not ratify the Kyoto protocol and why the inane mantra of the Labor Party at the present time is that you solve everything by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Firstly, as the foreign minister pointed out, without Kyoto -  - there would have been an increase of 41 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions and even if everybody met their target under Kyoto - which, manifestly and in most cases, unlike Australia, they are not going to - the greenhouse gas emissions would have risen by 40 per cent. So we would have purchased for the entirety of Kyoto but one per cent. The other reason is the reason that I gave in the answer to my first question, and that is that Kyoto in its present form - and there is no likelihood of it changing - does not obligate countries like India and China and does not include the United States. If you add those three countries together, you have approximately half of all of the greenhouse gas emissions. - If we are interested in reducing climate change and if we are interested in the future and the substance of a policy response to the challenge the world now confronts, we need to find a basis for an international agreement - a new agreement, a new Kyoto, whatever you want to call it - which binds everybody. That is something that has to include China, has to include India and it obviously must include the United States, which is the world's major polluter. - The government has made it clear repeatedly and I make it clear again today that we will be part of an international emissions trading system provided that it is a trading system that involves all the nations of the world.The member for Charlton then left the chamber. - Let me repeat that the government has for some time - and I repeat it again today - been of the view that Australia will fully participate in discussions to achieve an international agreement that embraces all of the countries of the world and most particularly the world's major emitters. If that were to occur, we would be willing to be part of an international emissions trading system.If anybody imagines for a moment that that is a position at which we have arrived in the wake of the Stern review, let me refer to the document that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition hoped that I would not throw around. It happens to be a document entitled Securing Australia's energy future and it was published some two years ago. On page 149, we made it perfectly clear in that document that we were open to participation in an international emissions trading system and that we would not, however, be willing to introduce a trading scheme in the absence of an effective global response. Our position for some years has been to the effect that I have outlined. If you can get all of the world's major emitters then we can be part of an emissions trading scheme but, until we do, it would betray the interests of, amongst others, the working men and women of Australia if this country were to embrace the policies of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and his very strong support of the government's policy in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to the challenge of lowering greenhouse gas emissions -  - this government believes in actions, not words. -  - Mr Speaker, I am not going to try and talk over them. -  - As I said, when it comes to the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions and lowering greenhouse gas emissions, this government believes in actions.The member for Hunter then left the chamber. - Actions like the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, which has seen projects already announced that will lower greenhouse gas emissions by millions of tonnes per annum; the $100 million renewable energy development initiative, which has already seen some 16 renewable energy projects awarded funding across the country; and of course the $75 million Solar Cities program, which is seeing groundbreaking solar energy technology trialled throughout Australia, including in Adelaide and Townsville. These programs are part of a $2 billion strategy laid out by this government. It is a strategy to lower greenhouse gas emissions which is unashamedly focused on practical technological measures which deliver real greenhouse gas reductions. This approach was emphasised heavily in today's Stern report. According to the report:Effective action on the scale required to tackle climate change requires a widespread shift to new or improved technology in key sectors ...The report goes on:... closer collaboration between government and industry will further stimulate the development of a broad portfolio of low carbon technologies and reduce costs.The report goes on to say:Policy should be aimed at bringing a portfolio of low-emission technology options to commercial viabilityThat is precisely what this government is doing, and those opposite are not prepared to accept the hard work of policy to put these initiatives in place. They chant 'Kyoto' and yet Stern says there is no single-bullet solution to this complex global issue. Concerted international action is needed, yet Labor continues to just say one thing: Kyoto.Kyoto is not a global trading system and it is not successful in lowering the greenhouse gas emissions of most countries. It binds less than half of the world to emissions reduction, and most of those are going to miss their targets. Over the life of the treaty, global emissions will grow by some 40 per cent. It shows once again that taxes, treaties and targets do not deliver greenhouse gas savings; technology does - and technology is exactly what this government is delivering.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is that the fundamental recommendation, observation, conclusion - call it what you will - of Stern is that you need a comprehensive international agreement and then you can have an emissions-trading system. That has been our position -  - That has been our position. I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not like me brandishing this document - and I will handle it with care! - but if you care to have a look at it you will find that, way back a couple of years ago, when we laid down the low emissions technology fund, we explicitly allowed for the day when you would have international agreement on an emissions-trading system. But it will not work unless everybody is in.The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - An international emissions-trading system will not work unless you have everybody in. - It will not work unless you have everybody in. According to that definition, to which the member for Grayndler assented, Kyoto is not an international emissions-trading system, because everybody is not in Kyoto. In particular, the countries responsible for half the world's emissions are not part of Kyoto.I was interested in the reaction of those who sit opposite when I said we needed a new Kyoto. Let me say that again: we do need a new Kyoto, because the old Kyoto has failed. The old Kyoto has been a failure because the old Kyoto did not have India and it did not have China. It had India and China as sort of nominal members, but they were - what do you call it in the jargon? - annex 2 countries. Or was it annex 1? In other words, they were signatories but they were not obligated. Therein lay, you might say, the investment death trap for Australia. If we had signed up to the failed Kyoto, what would have happened was that we would have assumed obligations. The member for Batman knows this, because the member for Batman still cares about the working men and women of Australia and he does not want their job opportunities destroyed. That is why we did not sign the old Kyoto.We would be part of a new Kyoto if the new Kyoto embraced all of the countries of the world, put us all on a proper footing and, very particularly, included all of the world's great emitters. If that were to happen, you could seriously talk about an emissions trading system; but, until you get that, it is manifestly against the interests of this nation to sign up to the current Kyoto because, if there is no change, all that will do is result in the export of jobs from this nation to other countries, where the obligations imposed are less than the obligations imposed on Australia.If we are to have a sensible debate about this issue - and I assume that that is what those who sit opposite want - then we must acknowledge that the goal is to get a framework where everybody is involved in an international emissions trading system. We are prepared to be part of the international negotiations needed to bring that about, but our precondition is that everybody is in. We are not signing something that obligates Australia and does not obligate other countries, particularly given the natural advantage that providence has given us in relation to fossil fuels. What a fool this country would be to itself, having been given this enormous natural advantage, if we were to take a disproportionate share and burden and, in effect, say to the world, 'We know that if we assume these obligations they will hobble our efficient export industries and they will not affect yours.' I am not going to do that and nor is any member of this government. But what we are going to do is very enthusiastically be part of an endeavour to find, if you like, a new Kyoto that embraces everybody and has an effective international emissions trading system. If everybody is in that, we can actually make a bit of progress.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and her interest in this matter. Australia accounts for about 1½ per cent of global emissions, yet we have the potential to have a significant impact on reducing global emissions through the development of innovative technologies that can be adapted globally. Our premier scientific and research organisation, the CSIRO, already has a strong track record of influencing international innovation. The Australian government has increased base funding for the CSIRO by some 45 per cent over the last 10 years to a record high of over $600 million this year. The CSIRO now ranks in the top one per cent of scientific institutions around the world in 13 of 22 research fields, including environment and ecology.In 2006-07 alone, the CSIRO is investing around $60 million on climate change research. This year, $30 million will be spent on energy research through one of our flagship research programs, Energy Transformed. That is targeting a wide range of technologies, including solar, wind, clean coal and hydrogen. The flagship program is also working on variable energy from wind and solar, and it has developed the Ultra battery, which is a long-life super battery. Some of the major breakthroughs by the CSIRO to date include using solar energy to transform natural gas to hydrogen, which could be used for future energy needs, and developing the world's most efficient method of extracting hydrogen from water.The Australian government supports the CSIRO in these efforts. In fact, this year we funded the CSIRO's $5.3 million National Solar Energy Centre, which is using solar energy to convert fossil fuels to gas. Members will be interested to know that CSIRO's manufacturing and infrastructure technology division is at the forefront of fuel cell research. This is an environmentally friendly technology that converts fossil fuel or hydrogen to electricity. I think members should also note that the CSIRO's expenditure on renewable energy has increased by almost 400 per cent since 2003 to over $15 million in 2006-07.But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has the answer. He has now pledged to save the planet. He is going to solve the problem of climate change single-handedly. At his doorstop this morning, he said:I am absolutely fair dinkum about dealing with the consequences of climate change. When we're elected to office, we will fix this.I would be very interested to know how the Leader of the Opposition intends to reduce emissions in China or India. While this government is supporting groundbreaking research into climate change, we are ensuring our economy remains strong, we are ensuring that there are low levels of unemployment and we are also working sensibly to reduce emissions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I can tell her that the Australian government has increased funding to the tax office by 55 per cent from 1999-2000 to 2006-07, from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion. Between 2001 and 2006, the ATO referred 862 cases to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Of those, 538 defendants were convicted, 105 were sentenced to jail and 318 were fined. In the last year, in 2005-06, the ATO completed 363 audits, which resulted in adjustments of $121.4 million to tax liabilities, with $33.1 million in penalties and $21.1 million in interest. It also finalised 367 investigations. Of 107 matters dealt with by the courts during the year, 102 resulted in successful prosecution. That is a 95 per cent success rate in prosecutions. The courts imposed prison sentences ranging from three months to eight years in 56 per cent of those cases. The courts also imposed reparation orders and fines.So the Australian Taxation Office has been extremely active in prosecuting those that engage in criminal breaches of the taxation act. The prosecution rate shows that the cases that they take are cases which are well founded, having a 95 per cent success rate. This has saved taxpayers generally hundreds of millions of dollars and in deterrence even more so, and with Operation Wickenby, the largest coordinated investigation between crime and enforcement authorities we have yet seen in Australia, we are actually taking stronger steps than ever in relation to criminal conduct against the tax system.The object of this is to make sure that everybody pays their fair share so that Australians generally can have lower taxation. Lower taxation was introduced as a result of this year's budget, where we raised thresholds and cut rates, and also in relation to superannuation, where the government has introduced the largest superannuation reform in Australian history. We could not do that kind of tax reform if we did not have a good system which was being observed by all, and the government supports the Australian Taxation Office in successful measures to bring that about.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. The member for Cowper recognises the significant importance of this program in assisting regional communities with their economic and social structures and the improvement that can take place with the assistance of the federal government. The member for Cowper would be aware that since 2003 about 1,088 projects have been funded to the tune of $213 million, having been approved by the government. But, most importantly, with all those projects, for every dollar that has been put in by the Commonwealth there has been $3 contributed by the partners, whether they be community groups or organisations, or local councils. So for every dollar we have put in we have attracted an extra $3 invested in those communities. One classic example in the member for Cowper's electorate is the Shearwater Patients and Carers Lodge in Coffs Harbour, which received $245,000 in Regional Partnerships funding. Local doctor and Rotary Club member Dr Paul Moran said of the project:Without the Regional Partnerships Program the Shearwater Lodge could not have been built. Shearwater Lodge is a great facility and Regional Partnerships is a great program.So that is in the electorate of the member for Cowper. Yesterday we heard from the Australian Labor Party spokesman, the member for Hotham, in a personal explanation at the end of question time, his commitment to maintain this program - and if we have a look at the website, under the page that features the member for Hotham, it is also there. But we have not had that commitment from the Leader of the Opposition. The last comment that the Leader of the Opposition made on Regional Partnerships that we have been able to find was made last year. I quote it:... the program's got to go. And we're going to fight like blazes between now and the Budget to force them to cancel this program.That was the Leader of the Opposition then, and, on the weekend, in talking about regional policy, he had the chance to make the commitment that the member for Hotham made in this House yesterday, that the Labor Party will keep this program. I hope, Member for Hotham, that your confidence in the leader is very strong - because we all know that the Leader of the Opposition walked away from you once before, on your preselection. I hope he backs you up in supporting the Regional Partnerships program, which is very important to regional Australia. We intend to keep this regional program that has been incredibly valuable for regional Australia. I am pleased to hear the member for Hotham wants to keep it as well. What we need to hear from the Leader of the Opposition is that the Labor Party is going to keep it.</DOC>

 - In answer to that question - and I am surprised the Leader of the Opposition has asked it - it is misleading to quote the UN report figures because they do not include all sectors of the economy and they exclude land use change and forestry.

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and, in response to it, I can indicate that since the introduction of Work Choices in March this year we have seen 205,000 jobs created in Australia. Of those 205,000 jobs, 184,000 jobs have been full-time jobs. That 205,000 is almost three times the average number of jobs created for the same six-month period in Australia over the previous 20 years.As I go around this country I meet employers and, in particular, employees who tell me about the higher wages and the jobs they have as a result of this government's economic policies. Not only is that reflected in the ABS data about job creation but also it is reflected in the latest ABS data about the increase in wages in Australia. What we have as a result of increased workplace flexibility in Australia is a larger number of jobs, a significant number of jobs having been created and wages going up, as reflected last week in the decision of the Australian Fair Pay Commission.The member for Hasluck asked me about the reaction of the union movement. Last week the ACTU finalised its industrial relations policy. This policy that Mr Combet and the ACTU put forward is interesting because in it not a word is said about building Australia's prosperity. There is nothing in this document about keeping the Australian economy strong and, significantly, there is nothing in this policy about creating jobs for Australians - a policy from the Australian Council of Trade Unions that makes no mention whatsoever about jobs and creating jobs in this country and that says nothing about the plight of those who remain unemployed in Australia and about their chances of moving into jobs.What we have once again from the ACTU is a document which is about the union bosses wanting to grab more power in Australia's workplaces. I believe Australians want to see a workplace relations system that strengthens the Australian economy, that gives more Australians an opportunity to get jobs for themselves and their families and that enables Australians to get out and have a go. There is nothing in the ACTU document about that. In stark contrast, Greg Combet and the Leader of the Opposition want simply to impose more union power on Australia. The Leader of the Opposition weakly caves in to every suggestion which is made by the ACTU. This would be a disaster for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those comments and those projections made. I think the Stern review, along with other reports, is making a contribution to the debate on climate change. I think it is very important, if we are to have a proper and intelligent analysis, that we look at these reports objectively. We do not ignore them nor do we invest them with some kind of scriptural relevance and status so as to blind ourselves to an objective embrace of what is needed. The future challenge of climate change can only be met by a variety of policies. Nobody put it better than the member for Batman. Let me return to his words because they are thoughts that I share:Those who hope to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources - and that obviously includes the member for Grayndler - such as solar, wind and wave power need to come to terms with the reality that renewable energies, while they have an important and growing role to play, can't provide affordable and continuous base load energy.He concludes by saying:Uranium is the other option for base load energy.Let me say this about the future: if you are serious about a future that deals with climate change, you have to look at the nuclear option, and those who set their faces against that have no conception. According to the member for Batman - who does at least continue to speak for the working men and women of this country, on the Labor side - you cannot replace base load power generation with solar and wind, and so you really have two alternatives. You either have to clean up coal or, alternatively - or in conjunction with that - you have to look at the nuclear option. If you are serious about the future, you will at the least do that. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to bring on his censure motion.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I did hear those remarks. - Whether Elliot Morley is a good man or a bad man, he is not speaking for his Prime Minister on this issue. I rather thought the Leader of the Opposition would ask this question. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and the House that the views that Elliot Morley expressed do not represent the views that have been expressed to me by the British Prime Minister and they do not represent the views -  - that were expressed publicly on, as I recall, 26 March this year when Mr Blair and I held a joint news conference. As best I can recall his remarks - and when I get hold of his precise remarks I will have them put into Hansard - Mr Blair said that, unless we get an agreement that includes countries like China, India and the United States, we are not going to have an effective international emissions-trading system. Indeed, my recollection of that encounter when Mr Blair came to Australia was that the observation on climate change that most fascinated him was that made in the meeting between ministers and the British Prime Minister in which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in our government made the observation that, if we were to close down all of our power stations tonight, it would take China only nine months of emissions in order to equal that contribution. I reject completely that that man was speaking for his Prime Minister on AM. I thought his remarks were somewhat patronising and certainly not representative of the views of his Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for that question. Needless to say - and I imagine that I speak for both sides of the House on this issue - the government would view with very deep concern both the possibility and certainly the actuality of a military coup in Fiji. We are concerned about threats that have been made against the constitutionally elected government by Commodore Frank Bainimarama over the past few days, including last week at the Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Suva and, most recently, last night. I conveyed to the Fijian Prime Minister the strong support of the government. I would remind the House that the government in Fiji was returned to office in free and fair elections in May. It has a multiparty cabinet, representing the views of the majority of the Fijian community regardless of race. Any illegal or unconstitutional action against the Fijian government by the military would severely damage not only the international reputation of Fiji but also its economy, especially its booming tourism sector.I told the Prime Minister last night that Australia strongly supported the duly and democratically elected government of Fiji. Separately, it has been made clear on behalf of Australia directly to Commodore Bainimarama on a number of occasions - and most recently in the last 24 hours - that the proper role of the military in a democracy is to respect and support the properly elected government. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston spoke yesterday to the Commodore and reiterated those views. We in the government would view any extraconstitutional moves in Fiji with the utmost seriousness. We are taking steps to be prepared to respond appropriately to possible developments.I spoke last night to the New Zealand Prime Minister, who shares the views that I am now expressing to the Australian parliament, and yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to Mr Greg Irwin, the Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, about possible regional responses. There are contingency plans in place to respond to any consular emergency. Naval vessels are being prepared to help with the evacuation of Australians if that should prove necessary and current travel advice recommends that Australians exercise caution. I do ask Australians intending to visit Fiji to monitor the advisory very closely. The situation is uncertain and could deteriorate quite rapidly without warning.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the member for Indi. I particularly appreciate her interest in this issue. On the one hand, the government welcomes the statement that North Korea will return to the six-party talks on an unconditional basis. We have consistently maintained that the solution to the North Korean crisis is going to be a solution best brought forward through the six-party process. These talks are the best way for North Korea to get the security assurance it claims it needs for it to normalise its full relationship with the international community and to begin the task of fixing its badly broken economy.Of course, it is not going to be sufficient for North Korea simply to return to talks. What we look for is action and solutions, and the North Koreans must move quickly to implement their commitments, which were agreed by all six parties in 2005 in the joint statement of principles. That statement of principles was an agreement to abandon North Korea's nuclear weapons and nuclear programs and for North Korea to return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. It is important to emphasise that the agreement to resume the six-party talks - and I understand the talks are going to take place before the end of the year - does not mean that the international community, including Australia, recognises North Korea's so-called, self-declared, nuclear status.I also take the opportunity to congratulate China and the United States of America for their efforts to achieve a resumption of the six-party talks. We have consistently and actively supported a strongly coordinated international response to the North Korean crisis. I think the fact that there was such a strong and coordinated response, manifesting itself in two Security Council resolutions, 1695 and 1718, has been instrumental in at least getting the six-party talks process going again. But it is very important to emphasise that talks are not enough. These talks have to lead to results, and the results have to include the denuclearisation of North Korea and North Korea being subjected to international safeguards and the full regime of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon and congratulate him on being the best member for Braddon for a very long period of time. Long may he continue in that role. Today the ABS released the annual national accounts, which take into account revisions showing that GDP grew 2.8 per cent in 2005-06. It also, in its annual publication, revised productivity, showing that labour productivity, which is output per hour worked in the market sector, grew 2.2 per cent in 2005-06. This was revised up from 1.9 per cent and in fact at 2.2 per cent it is in line with the average that we have had over the last five-year cycle to 2003-04 when labour productivity in the market sector grew 2.1 per cent.So the good news is that labour productivity was revised upwards. It shows that it is in line with, or marginally in front of, the last productivity cycle. But we have to keep productivity growing in Australia if we want to make sure that the Australian economy continues the longest growth period in Australian history. We are now in the longest period of economic growth ever recorded in Australia history.Absolutely essential to that is industrial relations reform. There could be no more important reform to boost labour productivity than an improvement in labour relations. It stands to reason that, if you can improve the system in which people work, you are going to get more productivity out of the labour market. That is why the OECD said this in its most recent survey on Australia:The increasing scope for direct negotiations between employers and employees has probably also helped to raise productivity as enterprise bargaining allows firms to adopt productivity enhancing practices and promotes a more cooperative work environment.The OECD said it. I noticed that there was a very, very long, wordy but intellectually light report put out by the glimmer twins last week - the member for Perth and the member for Lilley.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question, but I would suggest she not mislead the House by saying that CSIRO has reduced its investment in renewable energy technologies. That is just not correct. 
Opposition member - Then why did they say that? - They didn't. CSIRO reviews its research portfolio annually. Research projects sometimes cease; the investment is redirected into another area of similar research. So the million dollars that the member for Jagajaga is referring to, relating to the investigation of water-splitting technology, has been redirected into another renewable energy research project. So it is exactly the same amount of money in another renewable energy research project.This attack on CSIRO is quite out of bounds. CSIRO is our premier scientific organisation. It rates in the top one per cent of scientific organisations around the world in 13 out of 22 areas of scientific research. In fact - the member for Jagajaga refers to the investment in solar thermal technologies - it was announced today that CSIRO has been awarded an additional almost $3 million in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to be applied to solar thermal technologies. CSIRO is leading the world in a range of technologies, not only on variable energy but renewable energies, and has the government's complete support.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Deakin for the question. He has very strong credentials in the area of the environment and supports the government's ongoing role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This government is taking a leading role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, not just here but across our region. In the last week we have seen the government invest some $250 million in groundbreaking projects under the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, and this morning we saw another key plank in our climate change strategy, with the Prime Minister announcing a further $60 million for 42 clean energy projects as part of Australia's commitment to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This funding will help develop a suite of practical emission-reducing measures amongst partnership countries - technologies ranging from renewable energy to energy efficiency right through to clean coal.While the rest of the world talks about what should be done, in just nine months six nations representing 50 per cent of the world's economy, 50 per cent of the world's people and 50 per cent of the world's emissions have put in place the practical foundation for the solution to greenhouse gas emissions. Left behind, waiting for a clue, waiting for an idea, is the Labor Party, still clinging to old Kyoto, still wanting to impose unwanted and unfair costs on the economy, still wanting to send our industries -  - and our jobs overseas. - The debate has moved on, but Labor is stuck in the past with a scheme designed in Europe in the last century. This government, the Howard government, continues to support Australia's world-leading innovation, which can and will deliver real solutions to the greenhouse gas challenge and see them deployed right across the world. This government will continue to back innovative, practical measures on climate change, because taxes and targets do not deliver; technology does.</DOC>

 - I think Laurie Oakes is right: the member for Kingsford Smith ought to take his place. But the answer obviously is that the analogy drawn by the member is absurd. - Let me, while I am on my feet - because this question is obviously about climate change, so the answer I am going to give is relevant -  - Let me quote the words of the leader of one of the other partners in the coalition of the willing in Iraq, a very successful, noble and courageous Labour leader, Tony Blair. I invite everybody who has followed this debate, and particularly the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition at the beginning of question time, to let me read what Tony Blair had to say - and I was wrong when I said it was 26 March. It was 28 March this year, and I apologise for misleading the House. This is what Tony Blair had to say in answer to a question at our joint press -  - Yes, it is about Kyoto too - and not Kyoto 2, the new Kyoto; Kyoto as well. This is what he had to say:That is why it is just, as I say, a completely unrealistic debate to say that you could have a climate change agreement that doesn't involve China and then America obviously, and of course India which is also a country of over a billion people growing at a vast rate. Now we're not at the stage yet -  - He continued:that is Tony Blair's way of saying we have not reached a new Kyoto - but I think it is possible to build out of the initiatives that are happening today a more realistic framework that gives us a real chance of being able to reduce emissions, which is what we need to do, and protect the climate.The reality is that the coalition of the willing in Iraq was contributed to by Mr Blair. - Mr Blair knows, I know and other leaders in the AP6 know that the way of the future is to have an agreement that includes all of the world's major emitters. If we were to follow the advice and sign Australia up to an arrangement that imposed a carbon price on the valuable resource industries of this country that did not impose the same price on our competitors, we would, in the words of the member for Batman, who cares about the workers of Australia, do enormous damage not only to the resource industries of Australia but to the workers of Australia. If you want progress on climate change, you have got to involve everybody. If you want to destroy one of the most valuable sectors of the Australian economy, hobble the resource industry with a carbon price that is not being borne by our competitors - and that in reality is the policy of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I recognise that many parts of his electorate in Queensland are drought declared, and they are part of the many regions in which we have declared exceptional circumstances across Australia. I know that many of his constituents appreciate the assistance that the government is giving to farming families in those areas. In only the last two weeks we have announced 62 areas as being in drought exceptional circumstances, and we have increased the assistance we are giving to farming families in those areas. More than 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural land is now drought declared under exceptional circumstances, which is quite significant. Of course, we have announced extra counselling and emergency grants to be administered by the CWA. Obviously, we are talking to communities such as those communities in the member for Maranoa's electorate about any other measures that may need to be taken, if warranted, to assist people in those areas. We are not giving them false hope but we are trying in practical ways to help them through this very challenging time.We all need to remember that, at some stage, it will rain again, and we need to give people hope that that will take place. What we do not need to do is provide false hope that there is a quick fix. We need to recognise that this hot and dry drought is not the longest and not without precedence. The eight-year drought during World War II went for a longer period of time than this drought and, of course, history has recorded that the Federation drought, from the 1890s to 1902, went for longer than the existing drought that we are succumbing to at the moment.We do need to give people hope. They need to know that we as a nation are going to stand beside them and support them. But we cannot give them the false hope of a quick fix - and that is what the Leader of the Opposition has been doing. He has been creating the illusion that signing Kyoto is going to help out with this dry spell and the hot conditions at the moment. People need to understand that ratifying Kyoto will not stop the El Nino effect. Scientific evidence is in that this drought has been partly caused by an El Nino effect. The El Nino effect on our climatic patterns has been around for a long, long time. In fact, it has been around since before the Industrial Revolution. We did not even have the steam engine when this was happening in our climatic circumstances. Ratifying Kyoto will not stop El Nino, ratifying Kyoto will not change the fact that El Nino has been with us for centuries, and ratifying Kyoto will not prevent future climate change.The Labor Party has been wont to refer to and quote from the Stern report on climate change coming out of the United Kingdom. But another report has come out of the United Kingdom - a report by an all-party House of Lords committee which included a former Bank of England Governor. Commenting on the compliance mechanisms in the Kyoto protocol, the report said 'they were very weak and even counter-productive'. They went on to say that the targets that were set were going to make little difference to rates of warming. The Blair government has done nothing to refute those assertions in that report coming out of the House of Lords committee.The government is responding to and assisting with the drought in Australia in a very practical way. We are providing moral and financial assistance to the farmers of Australia and we are responding to climate change in a very practical way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barton for his question. Yes, I am aware of those allegations. The Australian Defence Force currently has 1,400 troops deployed across the Iraq theatre. We are currently working with 150,000 American troops, with British troops and with the 300,000 people in the Iraqi security forces. Prime Minister al-Maliki, democratically elected by 12 million brave Iraqis, is trying to deal with a very difficult and complex environment in Iraq. Part of that complexity is the religious tension between the Shia, the Sunni and the Kurds. It also involves terrorist elements that are seeking to foment violence within the country. Moqtada al-Sadr, of course, is one of the key players within Iraq. We also have fomenting of violence to some extent from some of the neighbouring countries. I can tell the member for Barton that one of the things that this government is very committed to is seeing that we will remain in Iraq. When I was in Baghdad, Prime Minister al-Maliki said, 'You, Australia, were with us from the start,' and I said to him, 'And we will be there supporting you, your government and your troops to support a democracy -  - Australia is committed to seeing that we will remain in Iraq to support the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces and our coalition partners until Iraq is in a position to cater for its own security. It is also important that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party appreciate -  - that what our troops are doing in Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar, based in Tallil, amongst many, many other things, includes constant day-to-day, week-to-week contact with -  - the provincial governors in those two provinces, constant contact with tribal leaders, negotiation of security arrangements and training of Iraqi security forces. It also means in part that we provide security assistance to the Iraqis when they need it. The one thing we will not do is what the Leader of the Opposition has said. The Leader of the Opposition has said that, on day one -  - One thing this government will not do, which we have communicated to the Iraqi government, the democratically elected government, is that we will not prematurely leave Iraq -  - demand that our allies and our coalition partners do our heavy lifting for us -  - The member for Calwell then left the chamber.The member for Cunningham then left the chamber. - The member for Cowan then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for his question. Of course, he knows only too well the impacts - the financial, social and psychological impacts - of drought on so much of rural and regional Australia at the moment. When we were first elected in 1996, it was very evident that not much had been done for the unemployed. It was a case of shifting around the deck chairs. Mickey mouse courses tended to be the way it went - anything so Labor could disguise the real unemployment figures. So one of the first things we did in 1997 was to introduce Work for the Dole. It has been hugely successful, with over half a million people in the last 10 years helped to a new life.Building on the experience of Work for the Dole, we looked at how that program might be tweaked and a further program evolved which would in particular address the problems in rural and regional drought affected areas, where there was a loss of rural workers. This is fairly self-evident to people in the country. When you have drought impacting on your farm, there is an enormous extra workload: there are livestock that have to be kept fed, there is water carting, feeding - a whole range of work that needs all hands to the mill. But, sadly, incomes also plummet, so many of our farms have had to let their rural workers go. Not only do you lose the labour on the farms that is essential but your own local communities can be downsized to the point where your schools, fire brigades, service clubs, sports clubs - the very fabric of your local community - are downsized and therefore threatened; they may become nonviable.So we introduced Drought Force. Drought Force is all about those who have lost their jobs in an EC declared area being able to volunteer to work on farms. It is interesting that no-one opposite is really interested in this, because they do not represent rural and regional Australia. But perhaps they might like to tune in, because it does impact on the rest of the country as well.If you volunteer to Drought Force because you have lost your job in an EC declared area, you can work on a farm property for 2½ days a week. Indeed, in most cases we see people volunteering to work full time. In return, you are paid Newstart allowance. So the farmer has your labour, but of course he cannot afford to pay. In addition to the Newstart allowance and some $20.80 extra a fortnight, the worker also receives a $1,600 training credit paid in two instalments. Right now, as we speak, there are people on Drought Force throughout drought affected Australia carting water, feeding stock, milking cows, fixing fences and cleaning out dams, but their very existence in that small local community is part of the fabric of that local life. Drought Force is one of the key ways that our government will ensure that our farm communities survive not only financially but also socially and psychologically.I ask that those opposite call on their state colleagues in state governments - particularly Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland - and ask them to also take this drought seriously. I am ashamed to be a Victorian, where our Victorian government has its hands in the pockets of farmers, charging them for water they are not delivering. It is a disgrace. The same is happening in New South Wales. This government, the John Howard government, is helping drought affected communities to survive. I call on the states to do likewise.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the importance of the 457 visa class -  - I was making the observation about the importance of the 457 visa class, because the Australian economy is performing very well. As I think the member should know, we have unemployment at record lows; we have high demand for skilled workers; and we have employers looking for ways to grow their businesses and employ more people which, in turn, will create wealth and jobs for Australians. And the 457 visa class, of course, is the key to meeting that demand at this time.The Prime Minister made the observation not so long ago - and I agree with it - that it was clear that the objective evidence is that wages are not being driven down. In fact, there was a two per cent increase in wages in the last quarter. Amanda Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, released a report on the temporary skilled migration program recently, and I would suggest that the honourable member may care to read it because it found that 93 per cent of those on visas surveyed were in managerial, professional, associate professional, trade or skilled occupations. In other words, they were highly skilled in the positions in which they were working; they were having average salaries of $65,000 per annum; they had to be paid a minimum salary level, and that was $41,850 in metropolitan Australia. This is not an indication that wages are being driven down. The overwhelming majority of temporary workers feel that they are being treated the same as others.I have observed the suggestion that because the 457 visa class is being used more frequently the percentage of visits is down, and in fact in percentage terms they may be, but in absolute numbers visits are well up, with DIMA having monitored over 6,471 sponsors in 2005-06, having side visits of 1,790 of out of 10,000 sponsors, and they are dedicating more resources, of course, to deal with more allegations that are being made from time to time. The minister has also responded with a $23.5 million package over four years to establish further strike teams to deal with these issues to ensure that employers of temporary workers are complying with the conditions of the visas, and measures to improve negotiation and management of labour agreements. This is an issue on which the government wants to have a program that has appropriate bona fide arrangements in place to ensure compliance, but it is a program that is in the national interest.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Boothby. I know that he is a stalwart supporter of freedom around the world, including in Iraq. -  - He is, Mr Speaker; he is. Yes, I am pleased to announce that yesterday we formally took over the overwatch role in a second province of Iraq, Dhi Qar province. Security responsibility for Dhi Qar was transferred to Iraq last month, and this is the second province where security has been transferred to the Iraqis. In the other, Al Muthanna, Australian troops have performed a stalwart role. Our overwatch role in Dhi Qar and Al Muthanna means that we will provide support to the Iraqi security forces in a crisis, if requested by the Iraqi government and/or coalition forces.Of course, in addition to that, we are training Iraqis and transferring responsibility for security to the trained Iraqis, and the Australian Defence Force is doing an excellent job in achieving these things. There has been a lot of criticism from the opposition of the government's policy - criticism, I must say, which is somewhat surprising, but nevertheless there has been criticism.From the time the opposition leader launched some parliamentary attack on the government over this issue, though, I must say I have - and I think the community has - become increasingly bewildered as to the Labor Party's position on Iraq. There have been three quite distinct positions that the Leader of the Opposition has taken on this issue in 10 days. First of all, he said that all troops should immediately leave Iraq. Then he did not feel very comfortable with that position so he moved on to a new position, which was that Australian troops should immediately leave Iraq, and the heavy lifting and the dangerous work should remain with the British and the Americans and other coalition forces who were in Iraq, but that Australia would just get out.His third position was that maybe not all Australian troops should be withdrawn from Iraq immediately - maybe we should leave some people there; maybe we should leave some troops behind. In fact if you add up the numbers, something like 900 of the 1,400 would be left behind under position No. 3 from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition cannot carry an argument from dawn till dusk without changing his position. Today the Leader of the Opposition in a radio interview when talking about his 'all out of Iraq' or 'some out of Iraq' or 'some Australians out of Iraq but not all Australians out of Iraq' position - or whatever his position is - said, 'We are not going to go out in a way that inconveniences allies.' So now we are going to say to the Americans and the British, and presumably the Iraqis, 'Excuse me, but would it inconvenience you if we left?' And they will say, 'Yes, it would be a little inconvenient. It would be a little inconvenient to see a great nation like Australia cut and run. Would you mind staying?' Presumably the Leader of the Opposition's position No. 4 is, 'Well, since it's inconvenient, maybe we won't do it.' If you want to be the Prime Minister of Australia, you have to have a clear-cut position on big issues. - The Leader of the Opposition professes to be some kind of strategic genius. He is always running around saying, 'I know all about the civil war and General McClelland.' He is his great hero from the civil war. He says that he knows all about the First World War, the Battle of the Somme, Fromelle, the Second World War and Tobruk. He knows all about this sort of thing; or so he claims in any case. But what we know about the Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot carry a serious argument, and cannot carry an argument with conviction and passion, from dawn till dusk. He certainly has not been able to on the issue of Iraq. - </DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Corangamite for his question and his support for ongoing workplace reform in Australia. I can confirm that the Office of Workplace Services, since its establishment in 1997, has won back more than $43 million for Australian workers where they were underpaid in the past. Indeed since the introduction of Work Choices on 27 March this year, the Office of Workplace Services has recovered over $5 million for almost 3,000 Australian workers. So this is a great service for Australian workers that the government has put in place. Furthermore, the Office of Workplace Services has conducted targeted industry education and compliance campaigns with the 193 inspectors and officials spread across 26 locations in Australia. These officials, those who have won back in total some $43 million for Australian workers, were the very same people who - The member for Lalor then left the chamber. - What I was saying to the House is that these officials, who have been responsible for reclaiming in total some $43 million for Australian workers where they have been underpaid, are the very same officials whom the Leader of the Opposition described here in question time, in a disgraceful attack, as snivelling little liars. That is what the Leader of the Opposition called these people. This was a disgraceful attack on officials who were doing a public service - and not only that; they were doing a great service for so many workers in Australia. If the Leader of the Opposition had an ounce of ticker, he would have the guts to stand up at the dispatch box in here and apologise to those officials who are doing such good work for Australian workers. His failure to do so since he made those claims, and his ongoing failure to do that, just proves once again that he is nothing more than a stooge for the union movement in this country.I was asked about plans in relation to abolishing this workers' watchdog. Indeed there are plans for that, because the Leader of the Opposition has announced that he would, if elected to government, abolish this Office of Workplace Services, which has done so much for Australian workers throughout this country. Once again it shows that the Leader of the Opposition does nothing but the bidding of the union officials in Australia. Indeed yesterday we heard the news from the Office of Workplace Services that it had recovered a record $650,000 for another group of employees in Australia.And I note that the response to this news - $650,000 being recovered for a group of employees in Australia - by the member for Perth, the opposition spokesperson for workplace relations, was to once again attack the Office of Workplace Services. What hypocrisy from a party that says it represents the workers of Australia - it attacks the very officials out there who are doing this work on behalf of the workers of Australia!Indeed, the member for Perth has been running around this country week after week, month after month, saying to anybody who will listen to him that Work Choices offers no protections for Australian workers. This action on the part of the Office of Workplace Services proves once again that his claims are simply untrue. When confronted with this reality - the reality of all this money which has been recovered on behalf of workers - all we have from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth is yet another attack on the Office of Workplace Services. The Office of Workplace Services is protecting Australian workers; all the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is protect his union bosses.</DOC>

 - First of all, all cables - The member for Fowler then left the chamber. - As I was just saying before I was so rudely interrupted, all cables are automatically, by definition, referred to my office, and that is about 130,000 a year. I would have thought that had become a bit apparent to people who knew something about how government works, because my portfolio is responsible for the cable system.But let me just repeat what I said earlier: the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is responsible for the issue of Airservices Australia, not the foreign minister, and that has always been the case. The recent report by the Australian National Audit Office confirmed that the investigation undertaken by the Australian Federal Police considered the conduct of Airservices employees. The advice received from the AFP was that there was no evidence to support a charge of criminal conduct contrary to Commonwealth law by Airservices Australia employees. So I would have thought that, as usual, the right things were being done. There was an Auditor-General's report; there has been an AFP investigation, and that is what we expect. - The honourable member who has been so cruelly cut down by the Leader of the Opposition, whose career has been so brutally terminated, interjects and says, 'What about good governance?' It is precisely the point: good governance is making sure things are investigated. Good governance is making sure there is a proper accounting system. We had the Australian National Audit Office and we had the Australian Federal Police conduct an investigation. Indeed, that is good governance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question, and I observe that he remains a very conscientious doctor as well as an influential and persuasive member of this House. From today I can inform the House that doctors and other health professionals will be able to deliver even more services under our great Medicare system. First, GPs will be able to provide patients with mental health plans, including access to up to 12 consultations with psychologists funded under Medicare.Second, GPs will be able to provide their middle-aged patients with risk factors with mid-life health checks designed to pick up problems before they become really serious. Obviously, this mid-life health check may well pick up type 2 diabetes. I should observe on that note the presence of kids in the House today promoting the cause of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and say how proud the government has been to commit some $30 million to a national centre of excellence for islet transplantation principally based at Westmead hospital.Third, practice nurses will be able to provide pap smears under Medicare throughout Australia and not just in country areas. Fourth, midwives and other health professionals will be able to provide antenatal services for and on behalf of GPs under Medicare in country areas. It is estimated that, altogether, Medicare will fund these services to the tune of some $600 million over the forward estimates period.I know members opposite do not like hearing that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, but it is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, and it is measures like this which further demonstrate that this government will spend the money necessary - wisely invest the money necessary - to make a good system even better.</DOC>

The second thing I can confirm is that the housing interest rate now is at 7¾ per cent, and if my recollection serves me correctly, the housing interest rate reached 17 per cent under the stewardship of the government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member.

 - I think that the member for McMillan and, of course, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Treasurer, the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premier will all be aware of federal government initiatives not only to encourage renewables but also - and very importantly - to encourage investment in low-emission technology. What we have said for more than two years is that the most important priority in reducing greenhouse gas emission is to accelerate investment in clean coal technology. That was the essence of the white paper that was put out 2½ years ago.That approach has been derided by those who sit opposite but this morning we find dramatic field evidence from two successful Labor politicians - namely, the Victorian Premier and the Queensland Premier - supporting very much the whole approach that is being taken by the federal government. This morning, the Premier of Queensland, who, of course, is the premier of the state that produces the most coal in this country - namely, the state of Queensland - and somebody who understands the impact of some of the careless policies flung around over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition on the workers in that state, had this to say:We have credibility on clean coal technology. We have a good track record on this and we need to move to the next stage now.Listen to this!If we can get clean coal technology in a commercial way it will not only clean up Australia but also China and other developing nations.That is what the Premier of Queensland had to say and his words were echoed by the spokesman for the Victorian government who said that they were putting their faith in clean coal technology.This is exactly what was in mind when the Callide A power station in Queensland was in receipt of $187 million from the government's low emission technology fund. There is an investment at Fairview Power leveraged by federal government investment of $445 million. And at International Power Pty Ltd in the Latrobe Valley, an area very well known to the member for McMillan, there is a proposal worth $360 million to retrofit brown coal drying, combined with ultra supercritical coal technology.This is exactly what we have been talking about for 2½ years, and this is exactly what the Labor Party, sitting over there in opposition, have been deriding for the last 2½ years. But they have been shown the way by their successful state colleagues. Peter Beattie and Steve Bracks have shown the way on this issue and, tellingly in the light of the remarks made by the member for Grayndler, Mr Beattie had this to say. In light of the fact that the two states have committed a combined $400 million to clean coal technology, Mr Beattie declared that Queensland favoured it over renewable energy sources because it was 'more practical and it will work quicker'. Those were not the words of John Howard or Ian Macfarlane, although John Howard and Ian Macfarlane agree with those words. I think both Ian Macfarlanes would agree with those words. Even the other Ian Macfarlane would agree with those words.Our position is very clear. For 2½ years we have been arguing the cause of clean coal technology and today we have seen the premiers of Queensland and Victoria blow the Leader of the Opposition out of the water on this issue, and, in the process, detonate the member for Grayndler. I thank the member for McMillan for such a searching question. - </DOC>

 - I think it is the job of political leaders in this country to read opinion polls but to do what they think is right for Australia. It is as simple as that. It may surprise many of those who sit behind me to know that the Leader of the Opposition has only become - how shall I put it? - an eleventh hour convert to the cause of ratifying Kyoto. Some years ago he was not quite as excited about it. In tireless research on this subject, it is amazing what you come across. Maybe there was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was influenced by these words from a person who came from his own native state of Western Australia. This is what this person had to say, writing in November 2001:For Australia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is to commit to a policy of decarbonisation of our industrial and export base. It is to inflict upon its people unemployment, profound economic dislocation and decline. For a nation to inflict upon itself such economic and political damage is almost unprecedented.Those were the words of a highly successful finance minister in the Hawke and Keating government by the name of Senator Peter Walsh. I'll tell you what: he was a lot more successful than any of you who sit opposite. He was a senior minister in a government. Let me simply say to the member for Melbourne Ports, who is a member I have some considerable respect for - through you, Mr Speaker -  - Oh yes, very out of touch. -  - Mr Speaker, let me say, through you, to the member for Melbourne Ports: yes, I have read that online poll - I think the member for Melbourne Ports understands the import of that adjective. I have read that online poll. Let me tell him and let me tell the Australian people: we listen to their views on this issue. We are aware of the need to take practical measures to address greenhouse gas emissions, but I say to them: we are not going to take measures that destroy the great comparative advantage that this country has, we are not going to be panicked into knee-jerk responses that will hobble great productive Australian industries with enormous costs that are not borne by their competitors overseas and we are not going to ratify a protocol which, in the words of a highly successful Labor minister, would do damage of an economic kind on an unprecedented scale to the great wealth-producing industries of this country.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question and for his interest. The government is very concerned about the comments of Commodore Frank Bainimarama that the military in Fiji could move to remove the democratically elected government of Fiji, and his references to violence and bloodshed were, in our view, completely unacceptable. The Fiji military have defied the order of the Fiji President, who is the commander-in-chief in Fiji, in relation to the suspension of Commodore Bainimarama. While police investigate threats that he has made, the Fiji police commissioner has grave concerns that the military breached port security, threatening police and forcibly taking seven tonnes of ammunition.This, unfortunately, is yet another occasion in our region where we have seen the rule of law defied. Defiance of the rule of law is anathema to the democratic principles that we all support here in this parliament and around Australia. Regional governments have consistently pointed out the proper role of the military in democracies. The Prime Minister has spoken with the Fiji and New Zealand prime ministers. I have spoken with the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum and we have had a number of discussions with a range of different people about measures that can be taken to try to discourage Commodore Bainimarama and the Fiji military more generally from taking unconstitutional action against the government of Fiji.It is important to remember that Fiji has been rebuilding its democracy after the two coups in 1987 and the coup in 2000, and in May there was an election for the parliament and a multiparty cabinet. Fiji has a good reputation overseas in international peacekeeping operations and I know that the Fiji Prime Minister himself last night, in an address to the nation, said that if there were to be a coup in Fiji then participation in those international peacekeeping operations could be, to use his words, severely prejudiced. There is no doubt that there would be risks to the Fiji military's participation in peacekeeping if they were to take unconstitutional action against the elected government of their country. We have been, as I mentioned, having some discussions with the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum and other Pacific Island Forum members about what as a region we could do to assist the Fiji government, and I think it is best that I say at this stage that those discussions are ongoing.We have increased our travel advisory yet again, urging Australians to exercise a high degree of caution if they are to go to Fiji. We have up to 7,000 Australians in Fiji and nearly 2,000 Australians who live there. There are a lot of visitors - 4,000 to 5,000 - at any one time. The situation is uncertain and could deteriorate. We think there is a very real chance there could be a coup in Fiji and it is important that all of us do everything we can to try to stop that occurring. Of course, at the end of the day, this is a matter that will be determined in Fiji by Fijians, but we are certainly doing everything we possibly can to try to stop the coup taking place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. Today we had the release of the September international trade in goods and services figures, which showed that the trade deficit in September increased to $646 million. This was principally caused by a decrease in exports of 1.5 per cent and resource exports were down, including coal, coke and briquettes, which fell 7.6 per cent. That is unfortunately a downturn in exports in the month of September. We also had retail trade figures released for September of this year which showed, in seasonally adjusted nominal terms, retail trade rose 0.1 per cent and was 5.9 per cent higher through the year. This is well down on the growth rates of eight to nine per cent that we saw in 2003 and 2004.The annual national accounts, which I referred to in the House yesterday, gave annual figures for the state of the economy and, amongst other things, revised up the household savings ratio which shows that households are saving more than they were thought to be saving. One of the reasons for the retail trade figures could well be that households are saving more of their income. When one looks at savings rates, however, the important thing to look at is savings rates in relation to assets. We have lived over the last 10 years through an enormous increase in private sector wealth - in fact, the largest increase in private sector wealth that we have ever seen in Australia. This is a point that was made by Mr Battellino of the Reserve Bank recently where he said:... conventional measures of saving do not take into account capital gains. This has a particular bearing on Australian households because ... they now hold a high proportion of their financial assets in investments such as shares and superannuation on which a significant part of the return is in the form of capital gains. In the May 2006 Statement on Monetary Policy, we showed that once allowance is made for capital gains, the saving rate of Australian households ... is neither low nor falling ...In other words, what the Reserve Bank has shown is that many Australians have decided to put their savings into shares or superannuation where they get a better return than they do in relation to an at-call bank account. Traditional measures of savings that only look at at-call bank accounts and then compare that to income miss the real story of what is going on in the Australian economy, which is people investing in higher yield, higher return mechanisms. This is something we believe will be thoroughly encouraged when Australia gets the biggest reform to superannuation that has ever been proposed in this country. The reforms that take place from 1 July next year mean there will be no tax on a pension or a lump sum when it is paid out of a taxed superannuation scheme. This makes superannuation the most preferred model of saving in the Australian economy. It will set many Australians up for a standard of living in their retirement which they would not otherwise have had. It is a reform that is being brought to the Australian people by the coalition government and we urge again that the Australian Labor Party get out of the way and support these reforms.</DOC>

 - I remember that a number of questions were asked in August. I would have to check the record as to the precise -  - I don't pretend to carry in my mind every single question asked through the year. I will conscientiously have a look at the question asked by the member for Grayndler and I will come back and give a more detailed answer. But in the meantime I take the opportunity of saying to the ladies and gentlemen who are in the gallery from that company that, if there is any injustice that has been done to you, that is wrong; and if there are remedies available to do with that injustice, those remedies should be invoked. -  - I might also say to the ladies and gentlemen from that company in the gallery -  - I will also take the opportunity of saying to the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery that the government I lead is the first government in Australia's history to bring in a scheme that guarantees the payment of certain basic entitlements in the event of a company not being able to -  -  - And I am very proud of that. I also take this opportunity of telling them in relation to redundancy that the government recently announced that it would increase the basic entitlement that would be paid under GEERS where there was a default by the employing company to the community standard of 16 weeks, which was adjudged by the Industrial Relations Commission.So, whilst those who sit opposite may seek to contrast their position from ours, I remind not only the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery but the Australian people that, when the Labor Party were in office for 13 years, they did not bother to introduce a scheme of this kind. They were prepared to let people lose their redundancies and other things when companies went broke. I am very proud of the fact that we have moved in relation to that.But in relation to the particular question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I will refer to the question asked by the member for Grayndler. If there is any further information that I can make available, particularly to the people in the gallery, I will be happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. As he is a professional engineer, I recognise his understanding of the importance of modern infrastructure right across Australia, not just in the metropolitan parts of Australia or the provincial cities but in rural and regional areas as well. The government also recognised that last year when we took a policy decision that would ensure the funding of infrastructure into the future, particularly telecommunications infrastructure that is needed greatly in the modern context. That high-speed broadband access is just as important as more traditional infrastructure in Australia such as roads and rail links across regional Australia.Last year we announced a package of about $1.1 billion called Connect Australia, which was going to add to the mobile phone network across Australia but, importantly, provide an opportunity for providers to bid for grants to roll out large-scale infrastructure projects to enhance the access to broadband across Australia. In this day and age, where almost any business and any individual needs access to the internet - and, increasingly, businesses need access to high-speed broadband - we recognise that need. That is the $1.1 billion package. The minister for communications has announced that roll-out.The $600 million broadband infrastructure fund that is currently being bid for is also out there. We encourage all operators - this is not just for any individual provider or technology; it is technology neutral and, if you like, provider neutral - because we want to get the best out of it and we want to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure across regional Australia as well.Beyond that, the government put in place the $2 billion perpetual communications fund, which is going to provide a flow of capital that can be deployed to ensure that regional Australians get access to modern technology as it becomes available -  - The member for Hotham says they won't. The only reason they won't is if the Leader of the Opposition gets an opportunity to get his hands on that fund and goes and spends it elsewhere. That is the only reason it will not deliver. - We have put in place a program where there is $1.1 billion available today and over the next couple of years - and, beyond that, a constant flow of revenue that will provide infrastructure across Australia, as is needed. - It will. But it will not if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way. He said that he will get hold of the $2 billion and spend it elsewhere. I guarantee that it will not get spent in regional Australia. We know all about the Labor Party and their track record as far as looking after regional Australia. They are big taxing, big spending governments with high interest rates and high unemployment. -  - Mr Seventeen Per Cent over there! Mr Eleven Per Cent Unemployment over there! The hard work that this government has done in putting together good savings measures that give certainty in terms of investment in infrastructure -  - It will give certainty as far as investment in infrastructure in the future -  - It will be ripped up by the Leader of the Opposition if he ever gets onto this side of the House and the Labor Party gets into government in Australia. Our government has put in place policies that guarantee in the long term that the investment and the capital will be available to ensure regional Australians get access to modern communications technology well into the future.</DOC>

 - I will tell you what is right: every charge of substance made against Work Choices -  - Martin, you know whose side you are on! You are the last bloke who should interject this week. You have been a humdinger for us this week, you really have. You should just sit there and know you are right. You are right, Martin. - I was referring to the member for Batman by a rather more affectionate term than 'you'. In reply to the member for Capricornia, I will tell you what is right: the three charges made against Work Choices by Labor and the unions have all been proved wrong. That is what is right. The first charge that was made against Work Choices was that it was going to cause enormous unemployment. The problem with that charge and why it falls to the ground is that, in almost seven months, we have had 205,000 new jobs created in Australia. - The second charge made against the legislation was that it was going to lead to strikes and industrial chaos. We have in fact in the last three months recorded the lowest level of industrial disputes in Australia since the records were kept. The third charge made against this legislation was that it was going to drive down wages. In the six months that have gone by, real wages have continued to rise at a rate of 16.4 per cent a year. We all know what happened to real wages in the 13 years of Labor. They fell by 0.2 per cent in real terms. - The final nail in the coffin was the absurd argument advanced by those who sit opposite and their supporters in the union movement that the new Fair Pay Commission, which they derisively called a low pay commission, was going to slash the minimum wage. You could see the thunder on their faces despite all the bonhomie they were displaying last Thursday when the decision came out from the Fair Pay Commission of a $27 a week increase in the minimum wage. So I say to the member for Capricornia - and I have not read that particular website - that what is right about Work Choices is that all of your claims against it are dead wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. Unlike other employers, the Commonwealth has never set aside payment for superannuation entitlements of its employees. Until this government established the Future Fund, it had made no provision for the just entitlements which public servants earn as part of their employment. In May 2006 we established the Future Fund and we deposited into it $18 billion. In 2006-07, we will deposit another $14 billion. We have now put aside nearly $30 billion towards the $100 billion of unfunded liability that the Commonwealth has. Just as with normal superannuation - where an employer makes a contribution into a fund - the employee gets the contribution and the earnings. But there are proposals to rob the Future Fund of its earnings - that is, to rob the earnings of superannuation entitlements. This has caused the chairman of the guardians, Mr David Murray, to say in Senate estimates:If that is done, the real growth rate of the fund would be zero to negligible - because you would be taking the earnings out.I have alerted the House to how the Leader of the Opposition promised to take earnings out of the Future Fund on one of his whistlestop tours to northern New South Wales. Like a bear to the honeypot is the Leader of the Opposition. But I find it has now gone wider than the Leader of the Opposition - the member for Lilley is now at it. Members of this House will know that every morning the member for Lilley wakes up, clears his throat, practises his focus group line for the day and comes in and delivers it. He does that every day except on days after journalists have been excluded from ALP conferences for no ticket, no start. He came in on 4 May 2006 and said this:... it's good news we got 18 billion,  - he is speaking of the Future Fund - it's bad news that it will be locked up to pay off public servants superannuation.The journalist said:You want ... that $18 billion spent ... ?He said this:The income from the Building Australia fund should be spent on productive pursuits - in other words, taking the income out of the Future Fund and spending it on his priorities; taking away superannuation earnings from the fund which the Labor Party never had the wit to set up.Last night I truly had an out-of-body experience. I was in my flat alone watching the ABC news. While watching the ABC news I saw the member for Lilley. He had obviously practised his focus poll-driven line for the morning and he delivered it. And the line for that day was: 'The government's global warming policies could be written on the back of a postage stamp.' But the camera had a wide-angle lens and as he delivered this line you could see his press secretary, Lachlan Harris, moving his lips in sync with those of the deliverer of the lines. They had obviously practised it to such a degree that the timing was perfect. I wish the member for Griffith wasn't enjoying this so much. We had the rooster puppet talking on this side and the ventriloquist mouthing the words on that side. The rooster -  -  - What do roosters do to chickens? Mr Speaker, I'm staying away! I have found on the web you can actually buy a thing called a rooster puppet: 'Don't be afraid to get cocky when you work this rooster puppet,' it says, 'you can strut and crow with the best of them when you animate his head and his feet.' So there was Lachlan Harris in sync with the member for Lilley with the tried and true practised line of the day -  - He is another white bread politician with no substance.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, through you, I would remind the member for Perth that it is now 2 November, the world has not come to an end and the sky has not fallen in. - We have continued to employ Australians at a record high. We have seen 205,000 more jobs created in Australia. - We have seen, to your great sorrow and sadness, the real wages of Australians continuing to rise. We have seen every slur against the Work Choices legislation - all wrong. - It is very interesting that on the last day of this week we hear from the member for Perth, having followed weeks and weeks and weeks of not having heard from him, because every time he gets up in this place he gets his facts wrong. He has established an absolute world record for a frontbencher in getting his facts wrong. Every claim he has made has been demonstrated to be wrong. Every specific example he has half quoted or misrepresented; explanatory clauses are left out of the questions he puts. The member for Perth, on industrial relations, has no credibility - no wonder the unions around the country are rumbling for his removal.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Mackellar for her question. Members opposite keep saying that this is one of the most important issues facing our country, so it is important to make the government's position absolutely crystal clear. So that no-one is under any doubt, let me make it clear to members opposite that this government believes very strongly that the best guarantee of good products and fair prices is competition, not government ownership. That is what we believe. - That is what Frances Sullivan of Catholic Health believes when he says that Medibank Private should not stay in government ownership, that is what Mark Fitzgibbon of the NIB health fund believes when he says that privatisation will lower premium pressure, that is what Professor Henry Ergas believes when he says that privatisation could reduce premium pressure by up to six per cent and, in their hearts, that is what members opposite believe. If it were otherwise, why did the former Labor government privatise the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas?Over the last two days a succession of Labor members have come into this parliament, led by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor, claiming that the privatisation of Medibank Private means that shareholders win and policyholders lose. What an implicit smear this is, what a shocking smear this is, on every private business in this country. If what members opposite say is true, why did the Kirner Labor government privatise the State Insurance Office in Victoria? I am not surprised that the member for Fremantle - she is in the House; welcome back - did not enter this debate, because when she was the Premier of Western Australia she passed legislation providing for the privatisation -  - of the State Insurance Office. On this issue Labor members are total hypocrites. Almost everything that Labor members have said about the privatisation of Medibank Private is a lie and they know it. When the Leader of the Opposition was in government he supported privatisation. He had the courage of Bob Hawke's convictions, he had the courage of Paul Keating's convictions, but it seems he has no convictions of his own. That is the problem with the Leader of the Opposition. We know what he is against - he is against everything which is potentially unpopular - but we do not know what he is for, and that is why he should never become the Prime Minister of this country.</DOC>

 - The truth is inconvenient for only one side of politics on that issue, and that is the opposition's side of politics, because all of the claims that were made have been proved wrong. They say, 'Oh, no,' they protest, they carry on, they yell and they scream, but nothing can alter the fact that you said the world was going to come to an end. You invoked the Chicken Little prediction - it was all going to come to an end. Of course it did not come to an end. You said there were going to be mass sackings; there have been mass hirings. You said wages were going to be driven down and they have continued to rise at a healthy rate. You said there were going to be mass industrial disputes; the reverse has been the case. I know you are unhappy at the state of the Australian economy. I know you are very, very unhappy, despite what you said, at the result that was brought out by the Fair Pay Commission last week. You had your press releases ready with figures based on another outcome, but of course it did not come that way. The Leader of the Opposition specifically referred -  - He who sits opposite me in this chamber invoked the figures of he who sits opposite the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Let me, in response to he who sits opposite, say that when it comes to statistics used by he who sits opposite the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations I always examine them very carefully before I act on them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fisher for his question and for his interest. In terms of the assessments the government receives on the situation in Iraq, we receive constant assessments from a range of sources - obviously from our embassy in Baghdad, from various departments here in Canberra and, importantly, from the Office of National Assessments. On 31 October the member for Griffith held a doorstop. The purpose of this doorstop was to attack the Office of National Assessments. This is what he said: 'The Office of National Assessments has not done an assessment on Iraq for more than 12 months. It has neither initiated an assessment by itself, one has not been commissioned by the government and there is none under way.'This is taking up the point that the Leader of the Opposition made. The Labor Party makes a series of assertions, hopes that the press gallery will run them, and then the truth is examined. What is the truth here? Since action was taken to get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime, the Office of National Assessments has produced 164 reports on Iraq. In the past 12 months the Office of National Assessments has produced 29 reports on Iraq, including four strategic assessments. So the claim made by the member for Griffith was false. This is part of the bewildering story from Labor on the whole issue of Iraq.Yesterday we heard the Leader of the Opposition - talking of the phrase 'inconvenient truth' - say that Australian troops would not be taken out of Iraq until it was convenient for our allies. He said that he did not want to inconvenience our allies. After question time he said that he did not really mean that. He held a doorstop. During the doorstop he was asked the very question you would expect: what would be the timeline, do you think, for the withdrawal of the troops? He said:Very shortly. You take a look at what Howard did with our forces who were engaged actively in active combat in Afghanistan. He took them out in about a month or two. We wouldn't require that.Three minutes passed - there were three more questions; it probably took him a bit longer than a minute to answer each question, I would imagine - and a journalist said to him:And you'd do that - that is, withdraw the troops - in less than a month, Mr Beazley?That was what he had just said. His reply was:You don't put timetables on those things ...This was three minutes later; three minutes later the policy changed again. So the journalist said:You said less than a month or two, didn't you? - It has everything to do with the question. So there was a situation where the Leader of the Opposition was asked:that is, withdraw the troops - in less than a month, Mr Beazley?Three minutes later and he says:You don't put timetables on those things ...The journalist went on to say:You said less than a month or two, didn't you?It is incredulous. The Leader of the Opposition said: ... It's strange that you'd want to nit-pick through this, quite frankly.That says it all. The Leader of the Opposition -  - The Leader of the Opposition hopes that he can send out some vibes on this issue without ever having to commit himself to any details or any facts. 'I do not want to inconvenience the Americans or the British; I do want to convenience the Left of the Labor Party.' 'We will withdraw immediately.' 'We'll do it in less than two months, but I am not going to set a timeline.' If you want to be the Prime Minister of this country, you have to know what you are talking about. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is a man of many words but a man of weak conviction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government will enact its election commitment with regard to the mandatory code of conduct, which was for suppliers to wholesalers. - The code of conduct is to institute transparency of actions, and the terms of trade will be defined so that every supplier knows exactly how their produce is being treated by wholesalers. Consequently you will know the delivery time and the price paid, and the relationship will be set in stone; whereas when a supplier is selling to a retailer or supermarket those terms of trade are necessarily known - you obviously know all the aspects that will now be incorporated in the code of conduct. To force a code of conduct, beyond the retail code of conduct, on the retailing sector would force up costs - which would be borne by suppliers. Let me make this perfectly clear: the mandatory code of conduct will set the terms of trade which are already part of a contract between a supplier and a retail outlet.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and I acknowledge her deep concern about this issue. Members of this House will be alarmed to learn that in the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal safety survey it was reported that in the year 2005 alone over 440,000 Australian women reported experiencing violence. The Howard government is committed to the prevention and elimination of violence against women wherever it occurs and in whatever community it occurs. As part of that commitment we have invested over $75 million in the Women's Safety Agenda, which seeks to prevent violence, whether sexual assault or domestic violence, through a range of projects, initiatives, research and education and by providing support to women who are the subject of violence. Part of that funding is directed towards a community awareness campaign entitled 'Violence against women: Australia says no'. This contains a hard-hitting and clear message that sexual assault is a crime and that violence against women should never be tolerated.The House will be aware of and should be appalled by recent comments attributed to community leaders, including a senior Muslim cleric in Western Australia, to the effect that sexual assaults only occur when men are provoked. Sexual assault is a crime. Rape is a crime. It has nothing to do with how a woman dresses or whether she is unaccompanied outside the home; it is all about power over another person. The Howard government condemns violence against women, we condemn the incitement of such violence and we condemn any excuses for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. Indeed I am aware of allegations because today the Melbourne Age newspaper, on its front page, under the headline 'Minister 'caved in to unions'', revealed that a senior Victorian Labor minister, John Lenders, caved in to pressure from the CFMEU to not award a contract to a Victorian company because that company had given evidence to the Cole royal commission into the building and construction inquiry.This story as revealed by the Age newspaper is a very serious allegation against a senior Victorian Labor minister in the Bracks government, because it goes on to allege that the minister was involved in a conspiracy to pay a bribe in a public works tendering process. This relates to an $8 million public works contract in Victoria in which the company, Able Demolitions, was removed from the tender short list for the demolition of the Morwell Gasworks. The allegation has foundation because the Bracks government has previously admitted to breaking the law by removing the contractor from the short list. But, having admitted that, they then fought for a court case all the way to the full court of the Federal Court of Australia to seek to prevent the revelation or the disclosure and the production of the documents in the case. Of course, these documents go to why this contractor was excluded.The documents that have been obtained by the Age newspaper, under a freedom of information request, show that Mr Lenders removed the contract from the tender list because of pressure from the CFMEU. Why did it do this? This occurred because this contractor had the temerity to provide evidence to the Cole royal commission about activities of the CFMEU on building sites in Victoria. This supports other evidence which was also provided to the royal commission about the influence of the CFMEU on the Victorian government.Let us make no mistake about this: this was payback. This was payback by a Labor government on behalf of the Victorian CFMEU, and the point here is: if a union such as the CFMEU can exert this influence on a senior Labor state minister in the state of Victoria, then imagine what influence they would exert on the Leader of the Opposition if he were ever in such a position. Why do I say that? Because the Leader of the Opposition has already caved in. He has already caved in to this influence from the CFMEU, because they have demanded, and he has announced, that he would abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission - the very body which has been established to look into cases of thuggery and intimidation -  - and, as it looks like now, bribery, which has been underway within the building and construction industry - a very vital sector of the economy in Australia.What this reflects is why this Cole commission was put in place. It reflects the need for legislation such as that which has established the Building and Construction Commission, but what it also reflects is the weakness of Labor governments at a state level and the weakness at a federal level in terms of the Leader of the Opposition, who is prepared to cave in to union demands and to in fact allow to remain in place this sort of intimidation and thuggery and, indeed, possibly bribery as well. What it shows once again is the essential weakness of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to these matters, his inability to actually stand up for what is right and what is proper - his weakness in every case that he simply bows to the bosses and the thugs of the union movement.</DOC>

 - First of all, the honourable member asked me about the truth and I think I demonstrated in answer to my question about the ONA that the member for Griffith had indeed not been telling the truth about the ONA. The first thing is that the member for Griffith -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The second point that I would make is that this is a matter that is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The Federal Police have asked -  - The second point I would make is that the Australian Federal Police are investigating these matters, and they obviously do not want their investigation compromised and have asked for it not to be compromised. I would have thought there were two things about this. First of all, nobody is guilty of anything until they have been charged and convicted. All this is is a police investigation -  The member for Charlton then left the chamber. 
 - The second thing is that it is the right thing to do, if there are concerns, to have the police investigate those things and that is it. If the Labor Party wants to compromise the investigation but apparently wants the truth to come out -  - those two things do not stack up. If you want these issues dealt with and resolved, they should be done so following due process in order that the investigation can be fully effective. There is no point in compromising the investigation just so you can make some childish party-political point. I would say to the Labor Party on these issues: when it comes to telling the truth -  - there is a long record over the last 12 months of some egregiously dishonest things having been said by the Leader of the Opposition - and indeed the member for Griffith - and due process should be followed. And you would think that somebody who wants to be the Prime Minister of Australia would lead a political party that wanted to follow due process, but apparently not. - Mr Speaker, I ask that the Leader of the Opposition withdraw that reference to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and note his interest in jobs. In addition to the $3.6 billion Welfare to Work program, which is going very well, Centrelink has been holding a series of job expos in remote parts of Australia and held one in Mount Isa last week. At that job expo, more than 500 people made their way through over 35 stalls and there were more than 250 jobs advertised. The government believes in matching potential workers with real jobs. The two questions that are being asked by potential workers are these: firstly, 'Are my wages going to be good?' Under the Howard government, real wages have increased by more than 16 per cent over the last 10 years. That is a great outcome for Australia's workers. The second question they ask is: 'What about my job security?' - In relation to job security, it is a fundamental point that no government can guarantee a job, no trade union can guarantee a job - only economic prosperity can guarantee jobs. That economic prosperity comes about through hard reform - such as reforms of the taxation system, changes in government fiscal policies and the introduction of Work Choices. Work Choices has delivered higher wages. It has delivered more than 205,000 jobs, and it has delivered the lowest level of industrial disputation since 1913.I met a guy who runs a sugar mill in south Cairns who said that he had put an employee who cuts the grass on an AWA because the fellow had said, 'My wife works in hospitality two days a week and starts work at 6 am, so can I start work at 6 am?' The boss said, 'I would love to give you that flexibility.' That worker who cuts the grass at the sugar mill said amen to AWAs. Then I went to Townsville, to the member for Herbert's electorate. There he is in the chamber. - I met an electrician who, because of AWAs, is now able to pick up his kids after school at three o'clock. He said amen to AWAs. Then I went to Bundaberg and met a fantastic number of workers who had signed a collective agreement. They now have a flexibility that gives them better wages and that responds to their individual needs. -  - It is a fundamental truth that Work Choices is delivering flexibility for Australian workers, it is delivering higher wages, it is delivering better job security and it is delivering economic prosperity for all Australians.</DOC>

The government is very concerned about comments made last week by Commodore Bainimarama, who is the head of the Fiji military force, saying that he was planning to remove the democratically elected government of Fiji in the next two weeks if they do not accede to a whole series of demands that he as the head of the military has made.The Australian government, the New Zealand government, the British and American governments and other governments - certainly those four - have made it absolutely clear to the Fiji military that this kind of language and these kinds of threats are completely unacceptable and that these threats, particularly if they are carried out, will threaten Fiji's political and economic stability.Last Thursday I spoke with Prime Minister Qarase of Fiji and suggested to him that it might now be worth reconsidering an earlier discussion we would have with Fiji about bringing together the Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers to address this crisis and to do so under the auspices of what is called the Biketawa Declaration. I am pleased that Fiji, in its capacity as chairman of the Pacific Islands Forum, and the Secretary General of the forum, Greg Urwin, have now agreed to call this meeting, which will take place in Sydney on Friday.We are doing everything we possibly can to try to stop Commodore Bainimarama from moving ahead with his coup in Fiji, but there is no doubt that he is somewhat committed to this course of action. We are deeply concerned about this and there will, of course, be significant consequences for Fiji's standing in the international community. I also think it will make the Fiji military a much less attractive partner in peacekeeping operations for the United Nations and, indeed, for other countries - such as ours - which work with and train the Fiji security forces.The Fijians, particularly the Fiji military, need to reflect on the fact that in 2000 there was a coup in Fiji and it had a devastating effect on Fiji's economy - maybe not such a devastating effect on the people mounting a coup, although, indeed, in that case, in the end, it did. I mean by 'economy' the ordinary people of Fiji, whose living standards plunged as a result of that coup. A further coup will have exactly the same consequence on the livelihoods of the ordinary people of Fiji.Given recent developments we have now upgraded our travel advisory for Fiji. We recommend that, due to the increasingly volatile situation, Australians reconsider the need to travel at this time. The situation there could deteriorate at any time without warning.The government is making sensible preparations in case the situation does deteriorate so that not only are we able to respond through our consular mechanisms but also the Australian Defence Force will be able to help Australians if they get into difficulty in Fiji in the event of there being a coup. There are up to 7,000 Australians in Fiji at any given time; about 1,750 Australians live in Fiji, and we have 4,000 to 5,000 visitors there on any given day. We are very concerned about the comments made by Commodore Bainimarama - so are the New Zealanders and a number of other countries.Commodore Bainimarama has been in New Zealand for the christening of his grandchild over the last few days, and the New Zealand government has used that opportunity to make very clear to him the views of the New Zealand government on this issue and the consequences for the relationship between New Zealand and Fiji if a coup were to go ahead. I hope the commodore understands these messages from Fiji's friends and neighbours that the region is united in endeavouring to ensure that a coup does not take place in Fiji.</DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is no. What I said yesterday, which he did not accurately quote, was that Mr Cole had said in February of last year that if, during his investigation, he discovered evidence that an officer of the Commonwealth - and that includes a minister - had broken a law of the Commonwealth, a state or territory, he would seek an extension of his terms of reference. He sought no such extension.It will be up to the Australian public when they read the report to draw their conclusions about the false allegations of dishonesty, negligence, bribery and corruption that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleague from Griffith for the last year. When the report comes out, the Australian public can judge the veracity of the outrageous allegations that have been made, especially against the character of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, in my view, has done an outstanding job representing the interests of this nation abroad. It is very easy to fling those sorts of allegations around under parliamentary privilege, but once the report is out the Australian public will make a judgement about the standards and behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can report to the House that the Group of 20 central bank governors and finance ministers met in Melbourne over 18 and 19 November. The group brings together the 19 systemically important economies of the world plus the European Union. It represents over 85 per cent of global GDP and two-thirds of global population. It is the premier economic forum to look at global issues and economic prospects.This forum brought together the key producers and consumers in world energy markets. The summit came to an agreement about ways to progress increased investment, openness, transparency and better pricing in those markets. It highlighted the benefits of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and garnered support for that, and called for the Joint Oil Data Initiative to be extended to other energy sectors such as natural gas. Getting certainty in world energy markets will be a big part of ensuring affordable energy and also containing global inflation.In addition to that, the meeting pressed ahead with reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. It has become a premier forum for reforming those institutions. It also analysed demographic change, and Australia made an offer to countries with ageing populations to assist with retirement incomes products and policy. In addition to that, it dealt with the issues of aid commitments and effectiveness. Many of those who were present indicated it was the best summit that the G20 has ever held.I would like to thank the officers of the Treasury, led by Martin Parkinson, who did such an outstanding job; the people of the Grand Hyatt in Melbourne for their work; Comcar, who did all the transport; and especially the Victoria Police, who had to put up with quite outrageous violence on the streets of Melbourne run by anarchist, socialist and other far-left groups. I want to particularly thank Gary Jamieson and Mick Williams, who were responsible for the security arrangements. I think all reasoned, thinking people would say that the right to protest is one thing but that appearing in the streets of a major capital city, charging barricades, destroying property and invading shops is totally unacceptable in our society and that police officers should not have to endure assaults or urine filled balloons being thrown at them. I would hope that even the Labor Party would support that proposition as well. I would hope that the Labor Party as well would thank the Victoria Police. - I do not know why the member for Lalor is interjecting. - Oh no, you weren't. You were not agreeing. You were saying, 'Grow up.' No wonder you are going as red as your hair, Member for Lalor. You were caught. You were saying, 'Grow up.' You were not endorsing the Victoria Police at all. Now you can come out and say that every well-meaning person would do that, and I would have expected that from the outset rather than those kinds of interjections. I would expect both sides of this House to support the Victoria Police in their efforts to keep the streets of Melbourne secure for innocent and peaceable people.</DOC>

 - I thought the Leader of the Opposition asked it better. Let me simply say that the answer to the honourable gentleman's question is no. I ask him to contain his energy, ambition or whatever it is for about another 50 minutes and he will be able to have a look at the findings of a person in whom the Leader of the Opposition expressed complete confidence in relation to both his ability and his independence.I will be very interested to see how the Leader of the Opposition squares what is in the report - and I do not intend to talk about the contents of the report - and any reaction he may have to the report with what he said about the quality of Mr Cole, who I would hope is regarded as a lawyer of great integrity, great repute and great forensic skills and as a completely and fearlessly independent man. He plainly is. That is what the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged earlier. I hope he has the courage to acknowledge it later as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and particularly for his representation of an electorate that is a critical gateway for our export industries, particularly through Gladstone. It is now a well-known statistic that in 1996 exports were worth $99 billion and in the last year they grew to $200 billion, doubling in just over a decade. Of course, that requires significant investment in the logistical infrastructure in Australia, and one of the ways we have done that is through programs we have had in place. In the member for Hinkler's electorate we funded, through the Roads of National Importance program, the all-important port link road in Gladstone to remove the conflict between industrial traffic going to the port and the domestic or commercial traffic in and around the city. I know that the Mayor of Gladstone is very appreciative of the support of the government in improving that infrastructure and, as the member for Hinkler often points out, there is more that needs to be done.We also have a responsibility to look at larger infrastructure projects to ensure that those exports have a seamless path out of Australia through our ports. The member for Hinkler would be well aware that Australia's largest single export now is coal. Last year $24.3 billion worth of coal went out through Australian ports, including the port of Gladstone, in his electorate. Just at the end of last week I was in Newcastle, in the port of Waratah. We opened a new piece of infrastructure there called the Sandgate rail flyover. The Commonwealth government, through AusLink, has invested $80 million in removing the conflict between urban passenger transport trains, interstate freight trains and the all-important coal lines getting into the port. That piece of infrastructure will now increase the capacity of getting coal to the port by 20 million tonnes a year. So we will be able to get 20 million tonnes of extra coal down to the port each year. It is going to increase pressure on the port of Waratah.The New South Wales government have been squarking loudly about how they have allocated an extra $500 million to increase the capacity of the port of Waratah. They need to get on and do it. They need to stop fiddling around with the planning processes and get on and do it. There are currently almost 50 ships lined up off the port of Waratah, in Newcastle, waiting to be loaded with coal. The Commonwealth government has invested $80 million to remove the one great impediment to the rail operation, bringing the coal down the Hunter Valley and getting it to the port. The New South Wales government, through its authority that runs the port of Newcastle, should get on with that investment to improve its capability.The $80 million we have invested in getting trains more efficiently to Kooragang is part of an overall $2.4 billion investment in rail infrastructure across Australia to make our exports more competitive and more efficient. The member for Hinkler asked whether the port authority in Gladstone is planning investment in new facilities up there, and moving ahead of demand. We should see this coming from the New South Wales government and the Port of Waratah, to match what the Commonwealth has done, to ensure and secure the jobs of those working in the coalmining industries in the Hunter Valley well and truly into the future.</DOC>

 - I will analyse the question, but let me begin with the terms of reference - and this is the central charge being made by the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith have worked themselves up into great indignity and fury trying to persuade the Australian public that we deliberately designed the terms of reference to protect ourselves. That argument has been completely blown out of the water by what Mr Cole said - but not in his report. The report will be coming down. I am not going to comment on the report until it has been tabled in the parliament. If you have a look at what he said on 3 February 2006 you will find that that allegation has been totally blown out of the water.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I can inform him that last week the coalition government announced the abolition of the sugar levy. The sugar levy was imposed to fund a $444 million reform package for the sugar industry. It raised $80 million towards that $444 million. - The abolition of the sugar levy, which was 3c a kilogram, will save users of sugar $28 million in the next year. I want to thank the member for Page and all of the others who represent -  - sugar-growing areas for their representations in relation to the levy. The levy's abolition has been received as great news for sugar growers and manufacturers. This is an example of the great policies of the coalition government.There are other tax proposals around at the moment which should be striking fear into the hearts of business. One of them that does strike fear into the hearts of business is right here in the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT government has so mismanaged its budget that it has now announced a new tax relating to infrastructure on unleased ACT land. Companies which want to invest in new infrastructure, such as gas, electricity, water or telecommunications, will be hit with a new tax relating to the size of their infrastructure footprint. The more you invest, the more you will be taxed.The rate to be applied per kilometre of infrastructure has not been announced, but the ACT government expects to collect $8 million in 2006-07, rising to $16.5 million in 2007-08. Who would think of introducing a new tax to tax, per kilometre, the installation of electricity, water or telecommunications? What sort of a government would do that? As the Daily Telegraph calls the Chief Minister of the ACT, 'John Stanhopeless' has thought up a tax on direct infrastructure. What a mockery this makes of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Lilley wanders around the country crowing on a daily basis about the need for more infrastructure. - On 9 November 2005 -  - the member for Lilley said:We need to ensure Australia's corporate tax regime encourages investment in much needed national infrastructure.So there he is, demanding a tax system to encourage investment in infrastructure, while the Labor government of the ACT imposes a direct new tax on every kilometre of infrastructure which is built.The Leader of the Opposition is saying that we need national leadership on infrastructure, whilst the ALP is imposing a direct new tax on every kilometre of new infrastructure, including every kilometre of new cable or optic fibre which is required for broadband. If we are going to get national leadership in relation to infrastructure, the first principle ought to be this: condemnation of the ACT Labor Party new tax, a demand that it be withdrawn immediately and a guarantee from federal Labor that federal Labor will not be imposing new taxes on national infrastructure. If you want to know the difference between a coalition government and a Labor government, you have seen it in this last week with the coalition government out there abolishing taxes and the Labor Party introducing new ones on national infrastructure.</DOC>

 - The views expressed by that former SAS officer - and I pay tribute to all serving and former SAS officers, whatever their views may be on individual issues - reflect the fact that there has been on this issue a division of opinion within the Australian community and it is barely surprising that that division of opinion would be reflected in Defence Force individuals because they are part of the Australian community. The remark made by the former SAS officer related to the government's state of knowledge in relation to weapons of mass destruction at the time of the invasion of Iraq. It is worth telling the House of an observation made on 7 February 2003, several weeks before the coalition operation. This observation reads as follows:No foreign office or defence department official anywhere on the globe entertains the view that Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction.That is an unconditional assertion which I do not think even I made in quite those terms. I do not think the Minister for Foreign Affairs made such an assertion. I do not think even Tony Blair made such an assertion, but do you know who did make it? The Leader of the Opposition, on 7 February 2003. I will simply say he entertained a bona fide belief before the invasion and he was not basing it on something we had told him - just as the member for Griffith told the State Zionist Council of Victoria that it was 'an empirical fact'.The truth of the matter is that both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith were fence-sitters on the question of the coalition operation. If it had gone differently, they would have turned around and said, 'Silly old Simon shouldn't have opposed it. If they had listened to me, we would not now be in this situation.' The Leader of the Opposition, who wrote in the Financial Review, 'No foreign office or defence department official anywhere on the globe entertains the view that Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction,' would now, three years later, parade to the world that he was always sceptical, that he always knew and that he was always a doubter, but the truth of the matter is that three years ago he was a weak fence-sitter and it now suits him to be a political opportunist.The member for Griffith had better brief the Leader of the Opposition on it because they are both as bad as each other. There is no contest on this. They might be rivals for the leadership, but they are not rivals for hypocrisy on the invasion of Iraq. They are co-conspirators in having had one position three years ago and now that it suits their miserable political hides to have a different position.I respect any SAS officer. He is entitled to his view. He belongs to a great democracy. Let nobody say that, way back three years ago, when we were arguing on the basis of the intelligence we had that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that was not the belief of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith. - They are rolled-gold hypocrites for pretending otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I can confirm to him and to the House that, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data, the level of long-term unemployment - that is, people who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer - has fallen to the lowest level in more than 20 years. Indeed, in October, the number of long-term unemployed in Australia fell by 3,400, a 4.1 per cent fall. Since the introduction of Work Choices at the end of March of this year, we have seen a 17 per cent fall in the number of long-term unemployed in Australia and the figure now stands at just over 80,000 people.Let me put this into context. According to the ABS, 10 years ago, when this government came to office, there were more than a quarter of a million more long-term unemployed than in October this year. I take just one example: in the Leader of the Opposition's state of Western Australia the number of long-term unemployed has fallen to a low of just 3,500 people. The strong economic management of this government has seen real results for real Australians who have got jobs in their thousands because of these changes. Whilst it is a reality that those numbers have fallen quite substantially, it remains the case - and we are acutely aware of it - that there are still 80,000 Australians who have been unemployed for a year or more. That is why continuing to deliver a strong economy and continuing to look at the challenges that face Australia in the future and making the requisite reforms so that we can address and meet those challenges will be important to further bringing unemployment down. The contrast here could not be more stark. The opposition are interested in one job only; we are interested in jobs for all Australians.</DOC>

 - The view expressed by the former SAS officer Mr Tinley is a view that quite a lot of people in the community hold. I have never pretended otherwise. I have acknowledged from the very beginning that the decision to involve ourselves in Iraq was not a popular one, and I respect the fact that there are people in the military who are against it, just as there are many people in the military who are strongly in favour of it. I think what it represents is a range of views in the community. I respect his view. I do not denigrate it. I disagree with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question, and I congratulate her on securing federal funding for a new after-hours GP clinic at Nepean Hospital which is opening next Monday. This is more good news from the Howard government for the people of Western Sydney.The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is at the heart of Australia's world-class health system. Since 1996, spending on the PBS has increased by some 148 per cent to over $6 billion in the last financial year and has subsidised some 170 million prescriptions. Since August alone, new drugs worth $250 million a year have been listed on the PBS. Historically, Australia has secured very competitive prices for new drugs, but we have been paying far too much for drugs that have come off patent. For instance, the cost to government of the cholesterol-lowering drug Simvastatin is over $50 in Australia and it is less than $10 in the United Kingdom.Ten days ago the government announced changes which mean that we should be able to more readily secure new drugs by paying less for existing drugs, and the price to government of many generic drugs will drop by 25 per cent in mid-2008. For about 200 existing drugs priced near or below the copayment, this should mean lower prices for patients too. These changes are very important in securing the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I would like to thank Medicines Australia and particularly the Pharmaceutical Guild for their constructive engagement with the government on this issue. I want to assure the House that this government remains absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary to make our already very good health system even better in the months and years ahead.</DOC>

 - I have already dealt with the state of mind of the Leader of the Opposition at the time the coalition operation took place. But the issue that everybody now has to confront - including the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, anybody who is interested in this issue - is: what are the consequences of a precipitated coalition withdrawal? - Everybody has an obligation to think for themselves on this issue, including even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. What you have to ask yourself is: if there is a precipitated withdrawal from the coalition, what are the consequences of that in the Middle East? This morning we have had our first really good news in five months in relation to Palestine and Israel. Hopefully, and I take this opportunity of saying this to the House on behalf of the government, this represents a step forward that can be maintained. But if there is a coalition defeat in Iraq - and the opposition is really advocating a coalition defeat in Iraq - that will cause immense instability in the Middle East. It will embolden those in the Arab world who do not believe in making peace with Israel to maintain that position because they will know that continued opposition to America and the West is costless. That will lead to greater instability in the Middle East. The terrorists will be emboldened, and that will have consequences in our part of the world.We can debate the situation of three years ago and, as I indicated in an earlier answer, I am very happy to debate what was said three years ago. I have ample evidence of what the Leader of the Opposition said three years ago, and I know his state of mind on weapons of mass destruction. The Leader of the Opposition was not relying on any advice we gave him, because he was not then on the front bench of the opposition. In his typical fashion, he was trying to be a guru - an expert - on this issue. He said there was not a defence department or foreign affairs department anywhere in the world that did not believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; in other words, he was sitting on the fence. The Leader of the Opposition was hedging his bets so that, if everything had gone swimmingly, he could say, 'Well, it was really that fellow over there' - the then Leader of the Opposition who implacably brought the Labor Party into opposition to what the government did - 'but what we are charged with now is understanding the consequences of the policy we now advocate.' The Leader of the Opposition is for precipitate withdrawal that would destabilise the Middle East, that would embolden the terrorists and that would endanger Australia's security in this part of the world. And that is why the government is opposed to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. I can confirm for him that recently an Australia-wide test on civics and citizenships was conducted of 20,000 Australian school students across 567 schools. I can also confirm to the member for Bass that only 23 per cent of year 10 students were able to identify a historical event that gives rise to Australia Day; in other words, 77 per cent of year 10 students were not able to state why we have a public holiday on Australia Day. They were not even able to hazard a guess. This is yet another example of the failure of state and territory governments in the running of their education systems. - This highlights how the teaching of Australian history has been downgraded in our schools. Let me put it in context. This morning, the New South Wales Labor Minister for Education and Training was asked about the teaching of Australian history. She was trumpeting the success of her government in teaching Australian history. She was asked why we celebrate Australia Day. She said:Why do we celebrate Australia Day? Well, we celebrate Australia Day because that's the - um - the day we became a nation, when the states joined together, the Federation of Australia. It's an important day to understand that history.Memo to the New South Wales Labor education minister: Australia Day commemorates 26 January 1788. Federation was on 1 January 1901. -  - The Australian government believes that all students, indeed all education ministers, should have a basic understanding of Australian history by the time they leave school. That is why we put Australian history on the national agenda with the convening of the Australian History Summit. The Howard government supports the recommendations of the Australian History Summit.The member for Denison then left the chamber. - This is why the Howard government supports the recommendation of the Australian History Summit that the teaching of Australian history be a stand-alone subject. It should be mandatory in years 9 and 10. The Australian government calls on federal Labor to support the Howard government's call for higher standards in our schools through greater national consistency. Specifically, we call on federal Labor to unequivocally support our call for Australian history to be a mandatory stand-alone subject across school curricula.</DOC>

 - I think the member has asked me two questions. The first is whether I would include the farm sector in the task force recently announced. I will consider that. I will not promise on the run to do that, because it may be that by including the farm sector you may have to include others as well and, by extension, you end up with an unmanageably large group. I will consider what the member has put to me but bear in mind that the purpose of this joint task force is to look at the potential shape of a world emissions trading system. Whilst the farm sector has an interest in that, I do not think the interest is quite as great as the interest of, say, the resource sector. I will consider it, but I do not make any promises. In relation to your question of 17 October, I confess that, offhand, I do not have any further information. I will try to get some as quickly as possible and to provide it to you this afternoon if that is feasible.</DOC>

 - I recognise that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie probably represents the biggest exporting electorate in the country. The critics on the other side of the chamber ought to acknowledge the fact that Kalgoorlie contributes enormously to our nation's export performance, particularly of resources. His real interest in this subject is quite obvious. Only a few weeks ago I visited a number of the facilities in his electorate and it is not possible to not be impressed by what is being achieved in Western Australia.In this context, I welcome the recent announcement by the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, that officials should restart critical talks under the Doha Round. I met last week the chairs of many of the groups, and they are looking forward to getting back to work. Clearly, a lot of things need to be done to put together something that might be acceptable as a new round of international trade agreements, but at least we are back at work.There are many key issues. The Americans need to do more in relation to their farm subsidies. The Europeans need to do more in relation to their exports, particularly their subsidies. The developing world also needs to do more to open its markets. But at least some discussions are going on, and it can only be hoped that this will lead to a fruitful outcome.The Prime Minister and the other leaders at APEC made a very important contribution to the debate in Hanoi. In their leaders' statement, they called for an ambitious outcome to the round and urged all the partners in the negotiations to go beyond their current positions. I think that is a key element. The leaders at Hanoi indicated their willingness to go further and called on other countries to do the same. It has to be that kind of spirit if there is going to be a successful outcome to the talks. Australia's own 'five plus five' proposal is the only constructive new idea on the table at the present time. That is also a key element in the discussions, but a lot more work needs to be done.The fact that the discussions are under way again gives the lie to the honourable member for Griffith. In July he put out a media statement saying that Doha was 'dead as a Dodo' and then went on to criticise the former Minister for Trade for being responsible for it all. So, once again, the statements of the honourable member for Griffith are coming back to haunt him. I suspect that demonstrates to all Australians that, if the Labor Party were ever given responsibility for trade policy, there would be no ambition, no desire, to do anything to help improve the lot of our exporters and to help build our nation's economy through stronger exports.</DOC>

 - I do not have any nuclear power stations. But let me say this: I do have an open mind about the energy needs of Australia in the future. I believe in a confident Australian future. I believe that this nation needs an energy policy that includes every option that will preserve our wealth, continue our economic growth and protect our environment. I believe that the only way we can do that is to look at all of the options. I am not prepared to go backwards like the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is a great one on going backwards. He wanted to go back on the GST. He wants to go back on workplace relations and he wants to go back on employment changes. My argument is a very simple argument - that is, if we care about a balanced future, about a sustainable future, we look at every option. We do not close our minds.I am interested to know, of course, where the questioner comes from. She comes from one of the great coalmining areas of Australia. I wonder whether she tells her constituents - those Labor members of the Newcastle council who voted to put a cap on the coalmining industry of the Hunter - about the consequences for Australian industry of the policy being advocated by the member for Grayndler. She probably takes the member for Batman to the Hunter but she never takes the member for Grayndler to the Hunter. The great problem for her is that the man who is making the environmental policy for the Labor Party, the anti coal environment policy of the Labor Party -  - Labor is anti the coal industry. Labor wants to cripple the Australian coal industry. If you double the MRETs or, worse than that, quadruple them, you are going to put a drain on Australian industry. You are going to make Australian industry less competitive, and that is going to hurt, not assist, the coal industry.If I were the member who asked me the question, I would be getting up in caucus tomorrow and asking the Leader of the Opposition to disavow the anti coal sentiment of the member for Grayndler and to embrace the skilful, intelligent, far-sighted views of the member for Batman. He speaks common sense on these issues. He speaks for Australia's future. The rest of his party represent Australia's past. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I am proud to lead a government that had the courage to have a full inquiry - the only government in the Western world that had the courage to do this, the only government in the Western world that responded in a very comprehensive fashion. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that I commend to him a reading of the report. I commend to the Leader of the Opposition some understanding of the findings of Mr Cole, and those findings indicate that all the allegations he so falsely made against the honour and the integrity of the foreign minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been demonstrated to be completely wrong.</DOC>

 - I have seen reports. For example, the AEU Victorian branch president, Mary Blewett, said that teachers, principals and school staff from across the state would gather in Melbourne on Thursday. They should not be gathering in Melbourne on Thursday; they should be at school on Thursday. They should be looking after the interests of the schoolchildren of Victoria.It is no secret to any member in this House that many Australian parents are voting with their feet against the government education system around the country, and they are not doing it because of funding: it is this kind of behaviour by teachers that gives government schools a bad name. Victoria has the highest percentage of school students enrolled in independent and Catholic schools in the country. This action by Victorian teachers will further reduce the esteem of the government education system in the eyes of Victorian parents. As somebody who is rather proudly the product of a government education system, let me say that I worry about this kind of behaviour undermining the quality of government education in Victoria and around Australia.Instead of attending a rock concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, instead of attending a Jimmy Barnes concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, these teachers should be in their classrooms. They should be doing what they are paid to do - that is, to teach the children of Victoria. If they want to demonstrate against our laws, they should do it in their own time, not in their children's time. This is a blow against government schools in Victoria. The fact that all through this answer those opposite have interjected on behalf of the striking teachers demonstrates how much contempt they hold for the government school education system. - Instead of heckling me, they should be encouraging the teachers of Victoria to stay at their post, do their job and look after the schoolchildren of Victoria.</DOC>

 - The people responsible for the breach of UN sanctions and for deceiving both my department and the United Nations - not according to the Labor Party, but according to Commissioner Cole - are the executives of AWB Ltd. We condemn, in any circumstances, all of those people - and it happens from time to time - who endeavour to defraud or mislead the Commonwealth in the process of breaking the law. That is why, following the Volcker inquiry, with which we cooperated, we established the Cole inquiry - because we wanted to get to the heart of this matter. As I explained on the radio this morning, we have nailed this by establishing what happened - and it would not have happened if it had not been for an independent inquiry. There are 66 countries and some 2,200 to 2,300 companies referred to in the Volcker report -  - and we are the only country that has established a report of this kind. The responsibility lies with the people who broke the law, and the government has addressed that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that Sensis released their business index for the October quarter today, which showed a solid improvement in perceptions of the economy and of the future economic direction, which rose strongly, improving by 14 per cent. The report also found that the federal government is the most supported government by small and medium enterprises in Australia, with a solid positive net rating - as opposed to the Labor state governments, which overwhelmingly have negative ratings by small and medium sized businesses. Of course, that is because Labor governments in all of the states do not care about small businesses. - All those state governments care about is militant unionism - the kind of unionism that you are going to see in Melbourne on Thursday and the kind of unionism which is anti small business. It is because Labor cannot stand up to their union controllers that small and medium sized businesses in this country will not accept that the state Labor governments are supportive. In addition to that, Standard and Poor's released their credit rating today, rating Australia's sovereign credit at AAA, the highest rating assigned by Standard and Poor's. Standard and Poor's noted in their assessment today that Australia has one of the best fiscal positions globally, which is reflected in the net creditor position of the Australian federal government.When this government came to office, we had a net debtor position of $96 billion. That is where the Australian accounts were left by the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley. Standard and Poor's now record that Australia has a net creditor position - that is, we have repaid $96 billion of Labor Party debt - and, as a consequence of that, Australia's credit rating is now AAA. I hardly need to remind the House that Australia was downgraded twice in its credit rating under the Labor Party. In 1986 we were downgraded to AA plus. In 1989 we were downgraded to AA. It was not until the coalition was elected that, in 1999, we were upgraded to AA plus, and in 2003 we recovered our AAA credit rating. These things were done by the coalition government; they could never have been done by the Labor Party. The Labor Party is the party that lost Australia's credit rating, and the Liberal and National parties have recovered it through proper economic management - the kind of management which the Labor Party failed to implement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I made clear, obviously the Cole commission found that AWB endeavoured to mislead the Commonwealth, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is the first point to understand. Secondly, I encourage honourable members to read the report. The report makes clear, fairly obviously, that this was a United Nations-run program. Mr Cole stated that the United Nations' acceptance of a contract after examination by UN experts provided a sound basis for the minister or his delegate - in this case it was the delegate - to grant approval for the export. He went on to say that DFAT did look at contracts. According to the Cole report, if the true nature of the arrangements had been disclosed to officers of DFAT, they would have acted differently.I think that is crucially important. The commissioner went on to say that by omitting any clear and accurate reference to the transportation arrangements, AWB effectively deprived DFAT of the opportunity to properly scrutinise and consider the legality of the arrangements actually in place between AWB and IGB. He went on to say that DFAT had been astute to give proper advice when asked regarding the operation of the UN sanctions and the oil -  - Not only did I say that AWB were responsible for defrauding the Commonwealth but let me ask, by rhetorical response, whether the member for Griffith and the Leader of the Opposition accept any responsibility for the allegations of collusion - the allegations that the government was fully aware of what was going on - for telling the Australian people that and whether that was a reasonable thing, or whether we will ever see the day when the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith appropriately apologise for what they said.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and recognise his professional interest in investment in infrastructure as an engineer. He has been a great proponent of the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline and of achieving that great investment that is going to deliver some enormous water savings to the nation, particularly to Victoria and the Wimmera-Mallee. There will be annual water savings of 80,000 megalitres when the investment by the Commonwealth is fully implemented, thanks to the hard work of the member for Mallee. He also recognises that the growth of our economy - and I think we are in about the 14th year of expansion - continues to increase pressure on our transport and logistics infrastructure. It is forecast that by 2020 the freight task in Australia will double from what it is today and the needs of the passenger task will grow by 40 per cent. So we have to continue that investment at all levels of our infrastructure to make sure we meet those requirements if we are to ensure the Australian economy will be as strong, as competitive and as efficient then as it is today.Our government is investing, over a five-year period, with AusLink $15 billion in road and rail infrastructure across Australia through all the different categories of roads as well as critical rail corridors, and I mentioned one yesterday. Given that the Australian Local Government Association conference is on here in Canberra this week, it is worth mentioning the Roads to Recovery program. This is a very popular program of local government. It is a very efficient program in terms of the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars. It is also the program that the Leader of the Opposition once referred to as a boondoggle. I do not think there would be one delegate from the Australian Local Government Association conference who would agree with the Leader of the Opposition in referring to the Roads to Recovery program as a boondoggle. It is a great investment in the road networks across Australia that feed into the major arterial networks across Australia. So we will continue to argue the case for investment in Australia's transport infrastructure to ensure that we remain competitive, that we remain efficient and that we keep the Australian economy strong.</DOC>

Let me say this: in my dealings with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, and all the other men and women of the National Party in this parliament I have found them to be people of total integrity and utterly trustworthy. That has been my experience, and any suggestion made by anybody to the opposite is a suggestion that I totally repudiate.Let me say also in relation to the press reports concerning the remarks made by the member for O'Connor that there is within the community a proper and healthy debate about wheat marketing arrangements, and I intend that debate to be resolved in a way that promotes the interests and the welfare of the wheat growers of this country. I have found over the years that the best friends the wheat growers of Australia have are members of the Liberal Party and members of the National Party not members of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and I can tell him that -  - I was asked about taxes on infrastructure and what they will do to business investment. Obviously, a new tax on infrastructure in this country will discourage new investment in infrastructure. I am very interested in the point of order because the point of order was that I should not be asked about political parties' policies, which confirms that this is ALP policy - a very instructive point of order. If I may say so, it is not the trap that Janice Crosio would have fallen into in this House. -  - She pales into insignificance compared to you, Mr Speaker. But a new tax on infrastructure in this country will be an obvious disincentive to investment. And here we are in the ACT, where a new tax is now being proposed on all infrastructure for all utilities including broadband. So we have the Labor Party federally saying they want more investment in broadband, whilst it is Labor policy to tax that new investment if it goes in. And this of course is brought to you by the Stanhopeless government here in the ACT.It is estimated that this new tax on infrastructure will add about $137 a year to consumer bills. I asked the federal Labor Party to dissociate themselves from this tax yesterday and the Canberra Times duly went to the member for Lilley and asked him to condemn this tax. And, according to the Canberra Times, Mr Swan said he had not seen the proposals and would have to have a look at them. Just so he can have a look at them, I table the letter from all of the telecommunications providers in the ACT to the Stanhope government protesting about this new tax. I also table the letter from Jon Stanhope of 23 November 2006 in which he defends his new tax on infrastructure. He says this: 'Importantly, having taken into account all of the factors ...', he is going to proceed. He says, 'Indeed, the government has been very open in acknowledging that there will be some impact on ACT consumers as a result.' In other words, he expects this new tax to be fully passed on to consumers.So here we have federal Labor feigning concern about a rise in the consumer price index while state Labor introduce new taxes to be passed directly into the consumer price index. Here we have -  - federal Labor saying that what we need is new infrastructure -  - in this country, whilst we have state Labor taxing new infrastructure in this country. Again, I call on federal Labor; I call on the member for Brand and the member for Lilley, and each and every other one of their small but dwindling faction, to come out and completely dissociate themselves from new taxes on infrastructure. It can be done very easily; it can be done by condemning the Stanhope proposal. - It can be done by saying that the Labor Party calls on it to be removed and it can be done by giving a pledge that federal Labor will not be trying to replicate this new tax right around the country. The people of Australia know this: Labor stands for new taxes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, he completely misrepresents the Assistant Treasurer, as per usual. I completely repudiate what he said about the Assistant Treasurer. Can I also refer the honourable member to section 26-52 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, which provides as follows:You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing you incur that is a *bribe to a foreign public official.It is quite specific. If anybody has attempted to deduct a bribe to a foreign official, it is in breach of section 26-52(1). The Commissioner of Taxation, who enforces the law, has the power to adjust any such tax and to impose penalties and an interest payment in relation to that. The Commissioner of Taxation has full power in relation to this matter. The question, unfortunately, is based on a false premise. I have full confidence in the Commissioner of Taxation to enforce the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</DOC>

My wife is involved in that campaign as well, so I am delighted that he has made an effort. -  - I think you misunderstand - not to mislead the House here in any way. - I think they must misunderstand, Mr Speaker. -  - I look forward to seeing her tonight!The member for Ballarat then left the chamber. - I am pleased to inform the House that my Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, and I signed the Australia-Indonesia Agreement on the Framework for Security Cooperation, as the Treaty of Lombok is formally called, in Indonesia on 13 November. This is a historic agreement, and it will provide a bedrock for the bilateral relationship between Indonesia and Australia for many years to come. So, even if there are difficulties in that relationship from time to time, we will have this bedrock of the relationship.It will of course provide a framework for dialogue exchanges but will also, importantly, provide for the implementation of joint activities in areas such as law enforcement cooperation, counter-terrorism, defence, maritime security, people trafficking, and emergency management and response. It also includes a clear support by both countries for each other's territorial integrity. It is an unambiguous statement by both our countries that we will not support the break-up of each other's countries. Obviously, it is hardly likely that Indonesia would support the break-up of Australia, but the Australian government would not in any circumstances support the break-up of Indonesia. That has been the position of Australian governments for a very long time. This agreement will in no way derogate from domestic laws in our country.Finally, let me make this point: the agreement will be subject to full public parliamentary scrutiny before it is ratified. I have written to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is chaired by the member for Boothby, to advise of my intention to table the agreement in parliament when all the paperwork is completed, which is likely to be during the course of next week.In short, as Dr Wirajuda has said, this agreement reflects the maturity of Australia-Indonesia relations as close neighbours and is an important landmark for the future. I think it will serve future generations of Australians and Indonesians very well by allowing us to work very closely together to deal with the sorts of modern threats which could affect Australians and Indonesians.</DOC>

 - I do appreciate the member for Macquarie's question. I note that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has increased to 79 per cent since the government's 'Strengthening Medicare' measures began. Bulk-billing is certainly not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners. And that is exactly what has happened, thanks to the policies of the Howard government.In the September quarter, the national GP bulk-billing rate hit 76.9 per cent. That is the 11th successive quarter of bulk-billing increases. It is an increase of more than 10 percentage points since December 2003. The bulk-billing rate for children, at 84.2 per cent, is at an all-time high. The bulk-billing rate for people aged over 65, at 87.1 per cent, is at a 10-year high.The government's 'Strengthening Medicare' package was not just about bulk-billing; it was also about helping people who do not get bulk-billed. That is why we introduced the new Medicare safety net. This year 1½ million Australians will be helped by that safety net. Last year 15,000 people in the electorate of Macquarie were helped by that safety net. But members opposite still want to abolish that safety net. The only party in this parliament that wants to cut health spending is the Australian Labor Party, which wants to abolish the Medicare safety net. Two months ago, the Leader of the Opposition called the safety net flawed and inflationary. No wonder only 24 per cent of the Australian public want him to lead the Australian Labor Party! Last month the member for Lalor called the safety net inflationary and inequitable. No wonder only 27 per cent of the Australian people want her to lead the Labor Party! While Labor agonises between a failed leader and flawed challenges, this government is getting on with delivering better health services to the Australian people and reinforcing its credentials as the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</DOC>

 - My answer to the Australian wheat growers is: as the Prime Minister has said, the Liberal and National Party government is the best friend that the wheat growers have -  - and we stand up for wheat growers over and over again. In fact, part of the Labor Party's narrative was that we turned a blind eye to or we were complicit in illegal activities of AWB because we were standing up for the wheat growers. That used to be the Labor Party's narrative. - That was the argument the Labor Party put for why we apparently thought the kickbacks were okay. - The fact is that at least some people in AWB Ltd, on the conclusions of the Cole commission report, may have broken the law. That of course is a matter to be investigated. Charges may or may not be brought; we will just have to wait and see. But AWB Ltd comprehensively misled the United Nations and the Australian government, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The honourable member is right to ask the question. Their behaviour was disgraceful. We condemn their behaviour in the strongest terms. So vigilant has the government been that it set up a royal commission to examine what AWB Ltd may or may not have done, and the government has very successfully got to the bottom of this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I note her deep interest in science and research, particularly in biofuels research - she has the largest ethanol plant in Australia in her electorate.The Howard government is committed to providing our best and brightest researchers with world-class research facilities. Yesterday I announced that half a billion dollars would be invested in world-class infrastructure so that our scientists and researchers can continue to focus their world competitive research in areas of national importance - for example, climate change, biofuels and the development of new drugs and therapies. This will mean that our researchers will have access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. It will also assist them in continuing fundamental research in life sciences, environmental sciences and the physical sciences including astronomy, in which we are a world leader.This strategy has been developed over the last 12 months. The research community has come together to collaborate and focus on priorities for research infrastructure in Australia. Some of the projects that will be funded include two pilot projects for biofuels research, a genetic bank for developing better crops for Australian farmers, a system for monitoring our oceans so that we can better predict weather patterns and a national network of medical imaging facilities. Instead of denigrating our scientific organisations, which is the pastime of the Labor Party, the Howard government -  - Oh, yes, you do! ANSTO? Yes, you do. The Howard government is focused on ensuring that our scientists and researchers are supported. In fact, this year the Australian government is investing nearly $6 billion in science and research - that is, the Howard government is focused on ensuring that our scientists and researchers are supported. In fact, this year the Australian government is investing nearly $6 billion in science and research. That is a 56 per cent increase on the funding that Labor put into science and research when they were in office.In the decade from 2001, the Howard government will have invested over $50 billion in science and research in this country. That is the largest investment by any Australian government at any time in our history.</DOC>

 - I was not aware of any party last night. I am obviously losing my touch because I was not asked. I will tell you what I was doing. Last night I was doing two things. It is interesting that the member for Wills asked me a question about our Defence Force. Last night, I attended a dinner organised by the Minister for Defence in honour of the retiring Secretary to the Department of Defence, Mr Ric Smith. I take this opportunity - given to me by the member for Wills - of placing on record my profound gratitude to Mr Smith for the faithful way in which he has served the Commonwealth of Australia and governments of both political persuasions in a number of positions. I first seriously encountered him when he was -  -  - You asked me a question about last night. I will give you an answer about last night. I first encountered Mr Smith when he was the Australian ambassador in Beijing when I visited that capital in 1997. He did an outstanding job in looking after the interests of Australia in the wake of the Bali attack when he was the ambassador in Jakarta and over the past three and a bit years he has served very effectively as the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I do not know whether there were any other parties going on, but after that, I went off to address a magnificent group of small business men and women, the pharmacists of Australia. The pharmacists of Australia have no better friend than the Howard government. I made that very plain to them last night.As for our troops overseas, I would hope that it was the bipartisan concern that our troops overseas would always be respected, would always be supported and would always be honoured irrespective of who was in power. I have to say that that cheap attempt by the member for Wills to suggest that in some way some of my colleagues were less than supportive of the troops overseas is absolutely contemptible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for the question. I recognise the important role that his electorate has in trade with the Asia-Pacific. It is a key setting point for many of our trading activities and has very close links with many of the countries of the Asia-Pacific. We have in the parliament this afternoon and this evening a number of business leaders from Australia who were involved in the Asia-Pacific region. The APEC Business Forum focuses particularly on our business associations with that region. It is on the hard work of the business of Australia that our trading relationship has grown so strongly over recent times. In 2005 our trade with APEC nations hit $250 billion for the first time. So it is a very significant part of our relationship.The report on trade that will be released later today shows that this figure results from an 18 per cent increase in our exports to APEC's 21 members and a 10 per cent increase in imports from those countries. APEC's goods and services trade has grown particularly strongly with Japan, China and Korea but there have also been increases to Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Thailand. It is of interest to note that eight out of 10 of Australia's top trading partners are in the APEC economies, and they account for 70 per cent of our trade to the world. So the APEC ministerial meeting and leaders meeting in Hanoi were particularly important in asserting a new agenda to look more closely at the way in which we can develop that trading relationship. It is clear that the future regional architecture will play a significant role in determining how we can build that trade. One of the key activities that Australia, as host for APEC next year, will be undertaking is exploring ways in which that trading relationship can grow stronger. We look forward to building on this $250 billion trading relationship in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - The claim made in the question by the Leader of the Opposition that the government let Australian money buy Saddam's bullets is quite untrue, and it has been demonstrated to be untrue. I know it has been the mantra of the Labor Party, and I know the Labor Party is intensely disappointed that Mr Cole did not find as the Labor Party wanted Mr Cole to find, but that claim is absolutely false. It has been demonstrated to be false by the findings of the Cole inquiry. If the advice of those opposite - more of others than of the Leader of the Opposition, and I at least concede that the Leader of the Opposition was a fence-sitter inside the Labor Party when it came -  - It is not rubbish at all. He is on the record as having said that every foreign ministry and defence department in the world believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. As for his erstwhile friend, the member for Griffith -  - He said it as an empirical fact. He said, 'Don't believe the intelligence; believe what the scientists have to say about it.' So let me say, as I said yesterday, that the former officer is entitled, as is any Australian, to have his views about the Iraq war, but the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that in some way we allowed our money to buy Saddam's bullets is not only a slur on the government and a slur on many people associated with the government but it has been proved totally wrong, a complete falsehood, by the findings of the commissioner.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the hard work and support of the member for McMillan on our policies in relation to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to practical measures and real results, there is no better example of those policies than the Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund. Through this fund the federal government is now supporting five cutting-edge low-emission projects to the tune of $310 million. These projects cover a suite of technologies, from clean coal technology to renewable energy to coal seam methane - projects worth some $2 billion. On Friday, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage announced that the government would be supporting the world's largest CO sequestration project. At its peak, this Gorgon project will be burying some three million tonnes per annum of CO every year off the coast of Western Australia.When this suite of technologies, demonstrated by the five projects, achieves its full potential, it is estimated that they could reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 million tonnes per year from 2030 - real projects, real outcomes, which is a stark contrast to the policies of the Labor Party. While I am talking about the Labor Party, I noticed an article in the Australian recently, notable for some words in it - 'effectively dead', 'irrelevant', 'ineffective', 'mostly symbolic'. The member for Griffith should not be smiling. I am not talking about the Leader of the Opposition; I am talking about a policy which he holds very dear - the Kyoto protocol.The article went on to say:... no-one now believes the treaty has the remotest chance of driving the reforms needed to make the withering cuts in emissions required ...No-one believes it except the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, who cling to an outdated, last-century policy while they ignore the opportunity to debate the potential of nuclear energy. They live in the past and they ignore practical solutions - unlike this government, which continues to deliver measures that lower greenhouse gases.</DOC>

 - Like any other person who holds high office, there are occasions when I do not sleep as well as I might otherwise because there are things on my mind. That is a perfectly normal thing, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me the question. In relation to the war in Iraq, the House is aware that the positions of the government and the opposition on this issue have been very different. I have pointed out in the last couple of days, and this question gives me an opportunity to point out again, that the Leader of the Opposition was less than enthusiastic in his endorsement of the Labor Party's position three years ago. He was not on the front bench. He believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and three years ago he was a classic fence sitter. It is now opportunistic for him to parade his credentials as having always been a devoted opponent. - He claims that in some way this government connived, allowed and was neglectful, which led to bullets being purchased with Australian money. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that it was not Australian money -  - but it was money that came out of the escrow account of the United Nations. It was money that ultimately belonged to the people of Iraq. It was not Australian money. So much is the Leader of the Opposition not on top of the facts of this debate that he even makes that fundamental mistake.As the Leader of the Opposition in a confected display of indignity winds himself up for yet another censure motion, the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition that we turned a blind eye and allowed bullets to be purchased that might have been used against Australian soldiers is a contemptible claim. Even the opposition leader, in his embattled status, knows that that is a contemptible claim.</DOC>

 - This is a follow-on from the question the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday. Let me not dissent from Commissioner Cole at all and urge the Leader of the Opposition to read the whole of that chapter - and, indeed, to spend a bit of time reading all of the relevant parts of the commissioner's report - because the conclusion the commissioner reaches is that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not know that AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime. It does not say that in June 2004 the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade knew that AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime. If the Leader of the Opposition chose to read the report, he would see that in continuing his reading through that chapter the commissioner draws his conclusion, and that is a simple conclusion, like it or loathe it: the Department of Foreign Affairs did not know that AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question and I appreciate how concerned she is and, indeed, all women in this House are about this issue. I am very pleased to inform her and the House that the government has decided to place the cervical cancer vaccine on the National Immunisation Program at a cost of some $436 million over four years. This is great news for the women of Australia. It is another win for the women of Australia delivered to them by the Howard government. Each year cervical cancer kills about 270 Australian women. Mortality rates have reduced by over 50 per cent over the past two decades. But there is now a chance to do more, thanks to the Gardasil vaccine developed by the Australian of the Year, Professor Ian Fraser. The vaccine prevents the virus that causes about 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases. From April next year, Gardasil will be on the National Immunisation Program on an ongoing basis for 12- to 13-year-old girls. For two years there will be a school based catch-up program for girls aged up to 18, and a GP based program for women aged up to 26.There are two important points I should make. Firstly, vaccinated women will still need regular pap smears, because this vaccine will not prevent all forms of cervical cancer. Secondly, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee expedited its reconsideration because of the logistics of a mainly school based roll-out but it otherwise applied standard cost-effectiveness criteria to its recommendation. I want to congratulate the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for its guardianship of Australia's drug and vaccine system. I would also like to thank senior officials of my department, particularly the Secretary, Jane Halton, and the First Assistant Secretary, Rosemary Huxtable, for securing good value for taxpayers as well as a very good deal for the women of Australia.</DOC>

 - I am sorry, the honourable Leader of the Opposition says 'without qualification'. He includes in the quote the qualification 'of its own volition' - that is, it is perfectly clear that Commissioner Cole is not alleging at that point that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade knew that AWB were paying kickbacks. That is obvious.Point No. 2: if the Leader of the Opposition would only read the report, he makes that clear in the conclusion he draws. The Leader of the Opposition claims he has read the report. It is yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition misleading this parliament. Of course the Leader of the Opposition has not read the report, because if he were to read the report he would find that two or so pages further on the commissioner draws his conclusions, and his conclusions are that the department did not know. The Leader of the Opposition can spend the whole of question time and the whole of the rest of his time as the Leader of the Opposition - which may not be very long - trying to establish that Commissioner Cole concluded that the department knew; but, frankly, the department did not know and the Leader of the Opposition's attempts to slur the reputation of officials of my department are reprehensible.</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Mitchell of my concern, based on a report in the Australian Financial Review this morning, that the New South Wales government is going to require businesses that sign New South Wales government contracts valued at $3.4 billion a year to agree to several union-friendly provisions. These provisions include a union right of entry into any workplace at any time and for any reason, including the recruitment of members. It is reported by the Financial Review that if companies breach these conditions they lose the government contracts and are excluded from tendering for any contracts in the future. This, if implemented, would be a return to the dark old days of ultradomination by unions in Australian workplaces.This is a glimpse into the future if Labor governed from coast to coast in Australia and governed also in Canberra. It would be a recipe for a return to the days when the unions ran the economy. That, of course, is still the gleam in the eye of Mr Greg Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, who said that there used to be a day when the unions ran Australia and it would not be a bad idea if we went back to it. I think it would be a very bad thing if we went back to the days when the unions ran this country, and what the Iemma government is reported as proposing in New South Wales is nothing more than a return to old-fashioned union thuggery and intimidation. It would represent bad regulation that would drive business away from New South Wales and, if it were repeated around Australia, would do a great deal to pull back the strong economic performance of this country of which the OECD reported so glowingly overnight.</DOC>

 - As it happens, I make two observations. The first is the observation the Prime Minister makes - that it is the character of the Australian Labor Party always to stick up for foreign interests against Australia. On this side of the House, we are on the side of Australia - The member for Denison then left the chamber. - The second observation I make is that Senator Coleman, whom I spoke to personally at the end of September about these matters, expressed the view to me in that conversation we had in New York that the Australian government, unlike other countries which had been mentioned in the Volcker report, had done precisely the right thing to set up a commission of inquiry into this whole matter. The third observation I would make is that I appreciate the honourable member asking about Senator Coleman, because on 27 November this is what he said: 'I 'formally' applaud the efforts of the Cole commission, which examined the facts in a thorough and comprehensive manner.' -  - This is what Senator Coleman said. You may not like Senator Coleman. He said:My subcommittee will review the Cole report with a fine-tooth comb to determine whether US interests were hurt by AWB's gross misconduct.The point I make is that, by setting up the Cole inquiry and subjecting officials to the fine-tooth comb, with all of the documents produced and made public, with public hearings and a long list, of course, of painful appearances by officials before the Cole commission - and many of the officials of my department, not surprisingly, did find it a very painful experience - we have been applauded by Senator Coleman for doing that. This, I think, casts Australia in a very good light - a point that Commissioner Cole himself made. The final point I would make is that the member for Griffith accuses an official of my department of lying. This official was Peter Baxter. He did not lie; he told the truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. Overnight the Paris based OECD released its latest assessment of the Australian economy. It was a very positive assessment of Australia and its prospects. The OECD forecasts real GDP to grow 2.6 per cent in calendar year 2006 and to pick up to three per cent in calendar year 2007 and 3.4 per cent in 2008, although it notes that growth could well be held back by the effects of the drought.The OECD expects growth to rebalance over this period, with domestic demand easing and business investment moderating but foreign demand to contribute more to growth through increased export volumes. The OECD expects Australia's strong labour market performance to continue, with an unemployment rate forecast to remain around five per cent or lower. It also sees inflation easing after the effects of recent petrol and fruit price increases passing through the system.What gives Australia great strength, of course, is the government's fiscal position, the government now having delivered nine surplus budgets and having repaid in total $96 billion of Labor Party debt. As the OECD notes, the general government surplus probably surprised on the upside but net government debt has recently been eliminated. That puts Australia in a very small class of countries around the world that are carrying no central government debt. Our debt to GDP ratio is zero. The OECD average is around 40 or 50 per cent. If we were at the OECD average on a debt to GDP ratio we would be carrying $500 billion worth of debt. But in fact we are carrying zero. The benefits of repairing Australia's fiscal position have given this country great strength. This great strength was brought by disciplined economic management, the kind of economic management that the coalition stands for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for such a riveting question! I would have thought that it was impossible for any Australian, let alone a member of the Australian parliament, not to know we are in the worst drought in 100 years. I find it incomprehensible. - But as you have invited me to talk about the Murray, if there is one government amongst the partner governments of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission -  - that has delivered beyond what it promised, it is the Commonwealth government, because not only have we delivered the hundreds of millions of dollars we agreed with the premiers that we would deliver back in 2004 but, in the last budget, without being required under any of the intergovernmental agreements to do so, we put another $500 million in.I pray for rain every day and I hope the member for Grayndler does, but it is a bit hard to meet aspirations about returning water to the Murray River when it does not rain. If the member for Grayndler has access to a solution to this problem, I am prepared to amend the opinion I currently have of him. If he is a rainmaker - if he has powers beyond what anybody on this side of the House ever thought he had - I am prepared to say I am totally wrong, I am prepared to apologise to him, I am prepared to say that he is a genius. - I am prepared to say all of these things. That is about the most stupid question you have ever asked.Leave granted. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. In answering it, I note that the unemployment rate in Lindsay, in the western suburbs of Sydney, has fallen from 7.3 per cent when the Howard government was elected to just 4.3 per cent today. In answer to the question of the honourable member for Lindsay, yes, I am aware of, in particular, teachers in New South Wales schools who have been providing political campaign material to young students to act as a postbox for their parents. This anti-Work-Choices pamphlet which has been distributed in schools in New South Wales by the teachers union is clearly inappropriate material to be given to children as young as kindergarten and grade 1 through to grade 6.What we have here is a blatant example of the unions in New South Wales seeking to politicise the school system in New South Wales by providing this material to children as young as prep in schools in New South Wales. It is this sort of behaviour by the teachers union in New South Wales which is part of the reason the Prime Minister said this week that parents are increasingly voting with their feet and moving from the public school system into the independent school system.The member for Sydney then left the chamber. - Imagine the outcry if I sent a letter to schools in New South Wales to be distributed to school students in which it outlined all the lies which Unions NSW had been uttering about Work Choices. There would be complete outrage from the other side in this place if that were to happen. The New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Carmel Tebbutt, may not know what Australia Day is, but can I say to her that this sort of activity is inappropriate on any day in schools in New South Wales. It is totally inappropriate.Tomorrow, teachers across Australia will in some cases close schools down so that they can attend, during a school day, rallies in relation to the anti-Work-Choices campaign by the unions in this country. I say: if the teachers and the union in Australia believe that this campaign is so important, why don't they do it on a day on which they do not have to close down schools in this country? The use of young students as a postal service to their parents is outrageous behaviour on the part of unions in New South Wales. They have been caught out once again peddling untruthful statements about Work Choices, and parents in New South Wales will once again be concerned about this radical influence in the New South Wales teachers union as such, to engage in outrageous behaviour such as this. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition. He should stand up here at this dispatch box and condemn this sort of behaviour on the part of unions in New South Wales and the teachers union in particular.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's question reminds me of a phrase I have used in recent months: my guarantee is my record. -  - Oh, they do not like that! They do not like that because, as each month goes by, the evidence steadily mounts that the scare campaign of the Australian Labor Party has been proved wrong. It is now 29 November and Work Choices came into operation on, I think, 27 March 2006, so we are now eight months into Work Choices. We have 200,000 more jobs. We have the lowest level of industrial disputes since before World War I. We have real wages continuing to rise. -  - Not World War II and not the Korean War but World War I. - I was asked about guarantees and I am talking about guarantees. The reality of delivery is the greatest guarantee you can have. There were all sorts of guarantees in the workplace legislation of this country when the Leader of the Opposition was employment minister, but that did not guarantee that unemployment did not go to over one million Australians. The only way you can guarantee jobs for Australians, falling unemployment and rising real wages is to run a strong economy. One of the ways you run a strong economy is to have pro-productivity industrial laws. - I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that he made all of these allegations when the legislation was brought in. He said wages would be driven down. He said unemployment would go up. He said strikes would break out. The Leader of the Opposition has been wrong, wrong, wrong about all of those allegations and his interpretation of our laws is completely and totally without foundation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gwydir for his question, and I certainly recognise the great work that he has done in representing the interests of regional Australia and in putting in place many of the programs that are there now with an adequate level of funding to support economic development and enhancement in regional Australia. As he points out, this is at a time of particularly severe economic stress for those areas of Australia affected by the worst drought that we have ever had.Talking about that particular issue, yesterday I had the pleasure and the honour, along with the member for Gwydir, to announce a $3.4 million grant for the Back o' Bourke project. It has been going through the system for some time. The Back o' Bourke Exhibition Centre is being funded under this government's Sustainable Regions Program. This program has been well received in those areas across Australia that we have targeted to assist regional industries and regional bodies to expand and develop.In fact, I met with a number of ACC chairs today who have been asking about the possibility of the extension of the Sustainable Regions Program. It is a program that has delivered around $100 million to 266 projects through eight regions in Australia - regions identified as needing specific assistance from the government. Of course, Bourke, which is part of the member for Gwydir's electorate, is one of those regions. It was good to help with the funding to complete the final stage of the Back o' Bourke Exhibition Centre. The centre will act as a major tourism icon for that part of New South Wales, telling 500 years of environmental and social history of the Darling River. This is very important given the focus that we as a nation should increasingly have on our history.It is one of the programs assisting regional Australia, but there are others that the member for Gwydir would be well aware of. In all of those programs we have seen that, for every dollar spent by the Commonwealth government, the local community organisations and local government bodies spend $2. So there is $3 being spent on the ground for every one that we make available. They are significant investments in regional Australia; they are helping to strengthen and bolster those regional communities and their economies.Add to that other programs that are broadly targeted at helping regional economies, like the Roads to Recovery program, which I mentioned yesterday, and that the Australian local government authorities are very appreciative of the work that is being done with that funding - about $2 billion over four years going from the Commonwealth government directly to local government. That never happened in the history of the Commonwealth until this government was elected to office. Local government had to always rely on rates and state governments, but state governments in Australia today are withdrawing their support for local government. The Commonwealth has had to step in to ensure that regional infrastructure is kept up to scratch, that we are able to maintain our competitive edge and our efficiency.Of course, the member for Gwydir played a significant role in the establishment of the program - a program, by the way, that the Leader of the Opposition referred to at one stage as a 'boondoggle'. As I said yesterday, every single local government representative in Australia would disagree with him on that point because they want that program continued.The point is that we are focusing on ensuring that we maintain our level of support, particularly during the worst drought this nation has ever had in regional Australia. The exceptional circumstances measures that we have announced for drought affected areas have been very well received because they are well targeted. The message to regional communities across Australia - and I know the member for Gwydir will relay this message to his regional communities - is that the coalition government will always stand beside them to ensure that our regional economy plays a significant role in securing the strength of our national economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth. He has made a welcome reappearance. We have not heard a lot from the member for Perth for the last month or so, but it is nice to have him back from the interchange bench. What I think the member for Perth fails to appreciate and acknowledge in his question is that, long before Work Choices was introduced, there were often arrangements whereby increases in salary were granted in lieu of some of the matters to which he has referred. - If you are going to have a proper analysis of how people are treated, you have to look at aggregate wage outcomes. As I keep reminding the member for Perth, wages continue to rise, people continue to have jobs, unemployment continues to fall -  - and the number of strikes continues to diminish. The world does not come to an end. I know you are sad and unhappy. I know you are devastated. It didn't quite work out as you had hoped, but the Australian people, as every week goes by, know that your crowd have been running a phoney scare campaign about Work Choices. They are awake to you. They will increasingly realise how you have tried to dupe them and they will know, as the months go by, that the best friend the workers of Australia have are the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - The ANZ Property Outlook reports that CBD markets are tightening and vacancy rates are falling in the cities. In Sydney, prime office rentals have now reached over $500 per square metre. In Brisbane, rentals have now reached over $400 per square metre. In Canberra, office rentals have now reached over $300 per square metre. But there is one building in Canberra that does not have a rental of $300 per square metre, or $400 per square metre, or $500 per square metre. There is a building in Canberra which has a rental of $1,100 per square metre. The ALP's Centenary House has a higher rent than rents in the West End of London, a higher rent than rents in Tokyo and a higher rent than rents in mid-town New York. - The new owner of Centenary House reports today that -  - when that lease - the lease which the ALP negotiated - returns to market in 2008, the current rental of $1,100 per square metre will fall to the market rate of $385 per square metre. In 2008 it will fall to a third of its current value. It is also estimated that this non-commercial rent has now creamed off $42 million from the Australian taxpayer for the Australian Labor Party. In 2004, when ALP Secretary Bob Hogg was asked why they had to negotiate such a rental for ALP Centenary House, he said that they had to have a high rental 'because high interest rates in the early 1990s led us to lock in a 10-year rate deal with the banks at 13 per cent'. In other words, they thought the Labor Party would remain in office, so they locked in at 13 per cent, and because they locked in at 13 per cent they had to go above market - market being $385 - to $1,100 a square metre.Members of the House will know that recently I have been keeping company with rock stars. Last week I had a meeting with Bono. Earlier in the year I met Australian rock stars such as Athol Guy of the Seekers. I also familiarised myself with another rock star, who played with a band called Midnight Oil. I leave to Midnight Oil the last word on the $42 million of creamed-off rent. It is the lyrics of a song called Beds are Burning. Have a listen to this: Opposition members - Sing it for us! - Have a listen to the lyrics:The time has come to say fair's fairTo pay the rentTo pay our shareThe time has come -  -  - It goes on:A fact's a fact -  The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.

 - As I indicated more than a year ago when the debate on Work Choices started, I was going to maintain the position that the best guarantee that anybody can give in relation to these matters is one's record. I do not intend to depart from that in answer to the question, but I am willing to say something about the Commonwealth Bank agreement. Contrary to the suggestions made by Mr Combet and also by some spokesman for the Labor Party, the Commonwealth Bank has been offering AWAs since 1997 and I understand that several thousand employees of the Commonwealth Bank are employed on AWAs, which is their choice. I understand that the latest version of the Commonwealth Bank AWA makes some changes to the hours of work provisions to increase the ability to address customer needs, including opening branches on the weekend - something that I am sure most customers would support.In relation to Saturday work, the Commonwealth Bank operates these branches at present on a volunteer basis and, for the 755 staff required to operate the 65 branches on weekends, the bank has over 2,300 people willing to work. AWAs at the Commonwealth Bank are offered to some new staff and some existing staff as a choice. I am advised that new and existing staff can choose to remain on the collective agreement and the award if they choose not to sign an AWA. I repeat that: I am advised that new and existing staff can choose to remain on the collective agreement and the award -  - if they choose not to sign an AWA. - I understand that the AWA example used in the media this morning, and I think also by Mr Combet and others, has a significant increase in the base rate of pay of 13 per cent with the potential to earn up to 10 per cent in performance bonus in 12 months time. The AWA does buy out several award conditions, but this has occurred since AWAs were introduced by the Commonwealth Bank in 1997. There is nothing new in this provision and I am advised that these particular AWAs would have been ones that could have been entered into under pre Work Choices law. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out again. He joins the ranks of the now discredited member for Perth when it comes to matters relating to Work Choices. I know this is a prelude to the big rally - the rock concert - that is going to occur at the G tomorrow. Melbourne is a well-organised union city. It will get a crowd - we all understand that - but the right, sound-thinking people of Middle Australia know a fear campaign when they see it, and they are staring one in the face. Every day that goes by, the campaign of the Leader of the Opposition has less and less potency.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and his interest. The current situation in Fiji does remain worrying and obviously the Australian government and other governments in the region urge a swift and peaceful resolution of the tensions - tensions which are clearly already having some impact on the vitally important tourism sector in Fiji. Today the New Zealand government hosted talks between the head of the Fijian military force, Commodore Bainimarama, and Prime Minister Qarase in Wellington. I congratulate the New Zealand government on using the opportunity of Commodore Bainimarama's presence in New Zealand - which was for a christening of his grandchild - to bring together Commodore Bainimarama and the Prime Minister. I understand that there was a very good discussion. My friend and colleague Winston Peters, the foreign minister of New Zealand, put out a press release in the last hour or so saying:We welcome the positive character of the discussions and the constructive spirit that both Prime Minister Qarase and Commodore Bainimarama brought to the table.Consultations will continue.Both Commodore Bainimarama and the Prime Minister are in the process of returning to Fiji. It is the hope of the Australian government - and I know very much of the New Zealand government and I am sure other governments in the region - that this more constructive approach can continue for a good deal of time to come so that we can ensure that Fiji remains a stable country, a country welcoming of tourists, a democratic country and a country that upholds the rule of law.Prime Minister Qarase has called a meeting on Friday of the Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers to discuss this crisis and, of course, we will see what happens in that meeting on Friday morning. I think it is highly likely that the forum foreign ministers not only will support democratic processes and the rule of law in Fiji but also would like to see continual consultations over differences in Fiji and not see resort to any action which would be outside the rule of law. I hope that these differences will be resolved and that tensions will reduce. I am pleased the New Zealand government - as ever, a great partner of Australia's in regional affairs - has taken the initiative it has. I think it has been a very helpful initiative and I hope that in time we will see a successful resolution of these problems in Fiji. But, in the meantime, let me remind the House that the situation in Fiji is very worrying and we, New Zealand and others are continuing to work for a successful resolution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for that question. I have two responses. The first response is to read out to him a provision contained in the offer of an AWA by the bank. It contains this expression of choice:If you are being offered employment by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, you may elect to accept that employment on the terms of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Employees Award 1999 and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Enterprise Bargaining Agreement 2002. You may obtain electronic access to a copy of these two documents. - In other words, what this demonstrates is -  - I do not think you know much about this. I do not think you know much at all. What this clause demonstrates very graphically and very directly is that these employees have a choice. They can either sign the AWA - and I will come to the contents of the AWA in a moment - or elect to be employed under the collective agreement and the enterprise bargaining agreement, both of which were formulated before Work Choices came into operation. In addition to that, it is not uncommon under workplace agreements that were approved prior to the coming into operation of Work Choices for certain award conditions to be bought off with higher salaries. What is offered here is a classic full range. You can be employed either under the enterprise agreement or under an arrangement that enables you to trade away some conditions in return for the opportunity of earning a higher salary.That is the kind of arrangement that millions of Australians want. That is why, by the time of the next election, almost one million Australians will be employed under Australian workplace agreements that give them opportunity and incentive, and why those one million Australians will not want the recipe for chaos and reduction in their living standards being offered by the Leader of the Opposition. We know who forced the Leader of the Opposition to give that commitment before the ALP state conference in New South Wales in June of this year. He will go along to one of the rallies tomorrow and they will cheer him to the rafters because he promised to do everything they asked of him. - But what he has neglected to do is what one million Australians ask of him - and that is to have the choice to better themselves by signing an Australian workplace agreement. If I were the Leader of the Opposition, I would choose a million Australians ahead of the union bosses of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and his interest. The response has been nothing short of astounding. On Sunday at the National Seniors conference on the Gold Coast, I announced this initiative, in partnership with the National Seniors: to come together to provide the expertise, the wisdom, the life experience and the work experience that these people have to remote communities and work with them to build a better Australia. There were about 240 people there on that morning and, of those, 100 people signed up straight after - not gave an expression of interest but actually signed up - to go to remote communities, in what I would say is probably the most complete expression of genuine reconciliation: people with practical measures going to remote communities, learning from the First Australians and giving to them. Since Sunday, that number has already grown to 150. The range of skills of those people includes farming, marketing, teaching, accounting and nursing - worthwhile knowledge and understanding that will help in a practical way in those communities.Two other things have occurred. We have insisted that, obviously, if people are going to go to these communities they will have to undertake not only police checks - as you would expect - but also cultural awareness training, so that they understand the circumstances and the life experience of the people that they are about to assist. Three people volunteered their time who are retired academics who have been teaching cultural awareness, to ensure that they provide that pro bono. Then a mobile home caravan manufacturer contacted National Seniors to say, 'We're so excited about this initiative that, for those who do not have their own form of house on their back - the grey nomads - we will assist and provide that.' So it just shows that this is starting to snowball. It is getting great assistance across the country.I would like to pass on one comment from a woman who lives in a remote community, Miriam Rose Baumann, who was here today. She is part of the NIC, the National Indigenous Council. She is a teacher - in fact, a principal - at a remote school in Daly River and she said, 'I always believe Aboriginal people, youth and students, should be exposed to the wider community - getting kids to understand there is a wider world.' She also said that schools definitely need assistance in teaching students how to read and write. I just want to congratulate her on the work she is doing.And I take this opportunity to thank the National Indigenous Council - with whom many of my colleagues met today as part of our regular taskforce meetings - for the many accomplishments that they have helped the government to achieve, including the domestic violence and sexual abuse summit. They have encouraged us to do more work with youth as far as sports achievements are concerned, and a myriad of other things. The NIC have performed an invaluable role for the government and we thank them for it.The opposition only has one idea in this - they recently put out a statement by their shadow minister and it was, basically, back to ATSIC. I find that a disappointing response. It is back to yesterday and a failed response. It did not help Australia. It will not help the Australian Aboriginals into the future.I say to the members opposite, and particularly the members for Maribyrnong and Corio: I understand that shortly you will be looking for a new career; if you feel that you want to go out and give your time in remote Aboriginal communities, you will be appreciated. And I guess that, in the event that the Leader of the Opposition finds a little more time on his hands shortly, he would find that his efforts in such a place would be greatly appreciated - perhaps a little more than they are in this place.</DOC>

 - When the Leader of the Opposition addressed a half-empty MCG this morning, he ought to have got one clear message, and that is that this outrageous, ridiculous scare campaign is losing traction with Australian people, because they can see through it. What do they see? They see that jobs are being created in significant numbers in Australia - 165,000 jobs since Work Choices came into existence and 129,000 of those full-time jobs. The only words that you never hear the Leader of the Opposition mention in this place are 'jobs for Australians'. The only job that he is interested in is his own job, and he is not doing too good a job about that either.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield, himself a former Black Hawk helicopter pilot, for his question. We are advised that at approximately 10 past three Australian Eastern Standard Time yesterday an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashed whilst attempting to land on HMAS Kanimbla and was lost into the sea. At the time of the crash, the helicopter was conducting a routine training flight approximately 150 nautical miles west-south-west of Suva, Fiji. There were 10 Army personnel onboard, including two pilots, two loadmasters and six members of the special armed services.Nine of these people were recovered. One of the people recovered later died as a result of injuries, while being treated by specialist medical staff on board HMAS Kanimbla. One person remains missing. The search has included multiple rigid-hold inflatable boats and HMAS Newcastle's Seahawk helicopter with infra-red sensors to aid detection at night. An RAAF AP-3C maritime patrol aircraft will join the search effort today and we will continue to search until all avenues have been exhausted.The deceased and seven of those involved in the accident have been transferred to HMAS Newcastle and will be moved to Noumea, from where they will be repatriated to Australia via an RAAF C130 Hercules, which will return to Australia late tomorrow. One of the people involved in the accident will remain on board Kanimbla and has returned to duty.The cause of the accident remains unknown. Defence has commenced an investigation which includes the deployment of a specialist accident investigation team to embark in HMAS Newcastle upon its arrival in Noumea. The names of the deceased pilot and the missing SAS trooper have not been released by the Chief of the Defence Force at this stage at the specific request of the families. I ask the media to respect the wishes of those families.It is important to remember why our defence personnel were there. They were doing what they always do on our behalf. They were there to support and protect Australians, should Australians require that protection and assistance over the next few days or weeks, should there be upheaval in Fiji. The operation will continue. The men and women on Kanimbla and on Newcastle will remain at their posts. It is extremely important that our naval vessels and our defence men and women remain on standby should Australians require it. That is what they were doing and that is what they will continue to do, as they have always done in the finest traditions of the Australian Defence Force.</DOC>

 - The first thing I will say to the member for Perth is that I will check the facts because every other time you come in here, mate, you mislead! We had the member for Perth in here yesterday misleading the parliament about the situation at the Commonwealth Bank. He was caught red-handed a few weeks ago in relation to electrical contractors here in Canberra. If there is anybody who has come in here more often and misled the parliament, I wonder who it could be. - Yes. It is a bit of a contest between the roosters as to who misleads this place the most. The first thing I say is that the member for Perth has now built a reputation in this place for simply not coming here and telling the whole truth, so I will check out the matter. The second thing is, and the member for Perth would know this -  - If the member for Perth were bothered to bone up on industrial relations 101, instead of wasting his time trying to prop up the Leader of the Opposition or making the silly excuses he did this morning as to why there were only 45,000 people at the MCG  and not the 100,000 as claimed - and he said that was because they could not catch a train! I bet they will be able to catch a train to get to the Boxing Day test. I caught a train to get to the grand final. So enough of these silly excuses. The fact is, you have egg all over your face.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. The member for Hinkler, representing a couple of very important ports in Queensland, would recognise that many of the predictions about previous reforms have been proven to be totally incorrect and that the reforms introduced by our government over the years, particularly with regard to the efficiency of ports, have certainly been achieved. I give the example of the waterfront reform that was undertaken by this government, which has significantly boosted the competitiveness and efficiency of our export industries and has seen crane rates in our container ports in 2006 go up to 27.7 movements per hour. In 1996 they were 16.9 movements per hour. Just as every other prediction by the Australian Labor Party and the union movement about reform in the workplace has been proven to be incorrect, they said this could not be done. They said you could not improve upon crane rates of 16.9 lifts per hour. Well, we have; that has taken place. The Australian Labor Party and the union movement have said in their scare campaign about Work Choices that this is about slashing wages, that it is about reducing levels of employment, that it is a green light for mass sackings - all the emotive lines that have been used in their scare campaign that continued today.The reality is that unemployment in Australia has hit a record low of 4.6 per cent. In the last 10 years, 1.9 million new jobs have been created in the economy in Australia. In that period, real wages have increased by 16.5 per cent. Since Work Choices was introduced, 165,000 new jobs have been created in the marketplace. Interestingly, 62 per cent of areas in regional Australia now have unemployment levels of lower than five per cent. We all remember what unemployment was like in regional Australia under the administration of the last Labor government. The Labor Party and the union movement - the ACTU - will continue their scare campaign, but the working men and women of Australia recognise what has taken place in this country under the coalition government to improve their circumstances, living standards and the economy in Australia. They recognise that the most important point is the real wage increase over the last 10 years of 16.5 per cent, which is the very reason they believe that the coalition government is a true friend of Australia's workers.</DOC>

 - The one thing that most disappoints the Leader of the Opposition is that his predictions have been proven totally wrong. This is the man who has waltzed around Australia for the last 12 or 18 months telling Australians that jobs would be destroyed as a result of Work Choices. What happened? He is wrong. Jobs have gone up. This is the man and the labour movement that has waltzed around Australia saying that Work Choices would be a green light -  - for slashing wages in Australia. Can I remind the House and the Leader of the Opposition of the thing that he said was not going to happen. - He said that the Fair Pay Commission was not going to increase wages; it was going to decrease wages. Can I remind him that tomorrow, 1 December, the Australian Fair Pay Commission will deliver a $27 increase in the weekly wages of the million lowest paid Australians. That is the outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I can tell him that reforming industrial relations is one of the reasons unemployment is now at a 30-year low in Australia at 4.6 per cent. The ACTU had its big demonstrations against Work Choices today. According to Sharan Burrow, there were 60,000 at the MCG. According to Billy Shorten, there were slightly above 50,000 at the MCG. According to the ABC, there were 40,000 at the MCG. The member for Lilley went on Charles Wooley's program and claimed: 'There aren't many occasions in Australian history where a political meeting has 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 people as they had in Melbourne.'The lesson to draw from that is: never trust an estimation of the numbers from the member for Lilley. That is my advice to the Leader of the Opposition: never trust an estimation of numbers from the member for Lilley. I have been to a few grand finals in my time at the MCG. Let me tell you, this was no Essendon-Collingwood match. This was no Anzac Day crowd; this was a VFA turnout. The excuses are now coming: 'The trains were off, so we couldn't get a train' or, as Greg Combet said, people were afraid of repercussions. Let me tell you, lots of people had lots of reasons not to be there. Former ACTU president Bob Hawke was not there. That is because he is in France hunting French deer with the hounds. According to Country Life magazine:At this year's meet in the oak forests of Champlevois in the Loire,  the crossroads were named after Mr Hawke and he made an acceptance speech surrounded by the hounds.It is a great country, this! You can start off as a working-class hero and finish your days hunting with the hounds in the Loire Valley, as many of those at the MCG did.Here is the figure to get in your minds: since Work Choices came into effect, 165,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. Get this figure in your mind: since Work Choices came into effect, four times the crowd at the MCG has been created in new jobs. That is 165,000 new jobs. Four times the number that rolled out at the MCG today have found work with new jobs as a consequence of Work Choices. The truth of the matter is that today was a political stunt. It flopped. Today will not interrupt the creation of new jobs. Today we continue with economic reform in Australia.</DOC>

 - If that is the best they can come up with, they are getting pretty desperate! What families today want is to have flexibility in their working arrangements. That is what families want. Yesterday the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition paraded the example of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank, as part of these changes, are able to provide more flexibility in employment. They are trying to employ people on weekends. They have 700 places available. Do you know how many people have applied for those 700 jobs which involve work on a Saturday morning when the banks will be open, which will be more family friendly as well? Two thousand three hundred people have applied for those 700 jobs.The contrast here is very stark. The contrast is between providing flexibility that employees want in the workplace and the inflexible, rigid system - the one-size-fits-all system - which the Labor Party want to take us back to in Australia. The reality is that Australian workers and their families are voting with their feet and they have rejected your proposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The changes put in place since 27 March have led to very significant benefits for Australians, Australian workers and Australian families. We have seen jobs growth, wages growth, record low industrial disputation, record low retrenchments in Australia, a 20-year long-term unemployment rate low and strong productivity growth.Let me take a little bit of the economic data about what has happened in the last six to eight months in Australia. For example, as the Treasurer has said, 165,000 Australians are in new jobs since 27 March this year, and 129,000 of those jobs are full-time jobs. But let me give you the significance of that historically. The job creation average for the last 20 years was just 70,000 jobs, and yet we have seen 165,000 jobs created since Work Choices was introduced this year. There is a 30-year unemployment low of 4.6 per cent.We have wages continuing to grow. As I said earlier, tomorrow the lowest paid workers in Australia - one million of them - will get something which the Leader of the Opposition, the Labor Party and the labour movement said would not happen, because they said this was about driving down wages. Tomorrow, the one million lowest paid Australian workers will get a $27 increase in their pay packet. That is good news for Australian workers; it is something which the Labor Party said was not going to happen. We have the lowest levels of industrial disputes on record - and records in one form or another go back to before Gallipoli.What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said that the changes would lead to a situation where employers and employees would be at each other's throats. Indeed, the contrary has occurred. We have a record low number of job retrenchments - the lowest for two decades in Australia - and long-term unemployed figures are also at 20-year lows.When you cut away the rhetoric of the opposition and the labour movement about this and look not just at the anecdotal evidence but at the official ABS data about what has happened in Australia, all of that data points to benefits for Australian workers and their families as a result of these changes. Yet we still have the Leader of the Opposition maintaining this scare campaign down there at the MCG today, saying he is going to rip up changes that bring advantages for Australians into the future. All of his predictions have been proven false over the last six to eight months since Work Choices came into place.Why does he want to do this? Because, in contrast to us - we are concerned about the national interest and how we continue to grow this country - the Leader of the Opposition is only interested in vested interests. He is only interested in his job, rather than jobs for all Australians. He is bitterly disappointed, I am sure, by the embarrassingly low turnout that they got at the MCG today. Look at all the excuses they are trying to make about why only half the number of people that they predicted were actually there. The reality is that these are changes which are good for Australia. This side of politics is prepared to make the decisions to ensure that Australia continues to grow. The only interest the other side has is: who is the Leader of the Opposition?</DOC>

 - One thing that has become clear over the last few months is that, when the opposition has come in here and made claims about some particular agreement, those claims, when investigated, have not stood up. I do not accept for one moment any allegation or assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday he was in here making assertions about a Commonwealth Bank agreement which where totally untrue. A month ago we had the member for Perth in here making allegations about electrical contractors and electrical workers in Canberra which were proven to be totally untrue. You have no reputation with regard to this at all. If the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Perth wants to come in here and wave pages and pieces of paper around, I suggest they start with the Australian newspaper, in which their colleagues regarded the member for Perth as a 'dud'. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and I note his deep concern and interest in this matter. I can confirm for the member for Macquarie that the ACTU did indeed hold a national strike today, and that included a number of school teachers. I am concerned that this will impact on students, who will suffer as a result of the fact that teachers skipped school to attend this strike. - I would suggest to state government school teachers that, instead of striking -  - against the federal government's Work Choices legislation, they call upon their employers - the state Labor governments - to improve their pay and their conditions.The Howard government believe that better performing teachers should receive higher pay. We believe that rewards should be given to teachers who achieve measured improvements in student achievements. Currently, teachers are generally paid according to the number of years in the job, so it is in accordance with the years that they have been serving time as a teacher; it has nothing to do with student achievement.Does this have consequences? Yes, it does. A principal in a primary school in the member for Jagajaga's electorate, Bellfield primary, made radical improvements over a number of years to student achievements in literacy and numeracy. He did this by making teachers accountable for student outcomes. He was paid not one cent more than the timeservers, so the consequence is that he has moved out of the public education system. This is the consequence of state Labor governments failing to appropriately recognise the role that teachers play.I would suggest that the state Labor governments link teacher pay to performance so that student outcomes are taken into account. This would mean better standards in all of our schools. The trouble is that state Labor governments are unable to reward high-performing teachers. They are unable to link pay to student achievement because they are captive to the teachers unions, who put their own interests above the welfare of their students.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her interest in this important event. As she said in her question, the NATO leaders met in Riga in Latvia last night. During that meeting, which normally is not something Australia would focus on, there were two particular issues and outcomes which were, in my view, very favourable to Australia. The first was that this meeting considered the proposal promoted by the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, that a contact group of like-minded countries that can work with NATO in different operations outside of the transatlantic sphere should be established. The NATO summit decided to proceed with that proposal. In that contact group is Australia; it will also include countries like Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.This is an important development because, when consideration is given to the great global struggles that we all have to confront, it is important that the Western alliance and Western interests are understood to mean more than just transatlantic interests and the transatlantic alliance. It is important in that context to understand the importance of Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and other countries in the broad international effort against, for example, terrorism. The fact that Australian troops participate in Afghanistan with NATO - indeed, working side by side with a NATO country, the Netherlands - is an illustration of that point. So I am delighted to see this relationship with NATO move forward. It was something that was discussed at some length during my visit to the North Atlantic Council earlier this year.Secondly, and very importantly - and this was also an issue discussed during my meeting with the North Atlantic Council recently - some of the caveats which limit the activities of some of the NATO forces in Afghanistan have been, if not removed, certainly reduced. This is important because there are a number of countries, and importantly Australia is one, which have troops in southern Afghanistan. Other countries which participate in Afghanistan under the umbrella of NATO have caveats on their troops not moving into the southern part of the country and other restrictions over and above that. This was an issue that I raised during the North Atlantic Council meeting earlier this year that I referred to because, if those caveats are lifted, that obviously means that there are foreign forces that can provide more support for Australia, as well as countries like Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and obviously America, than would otherwise be the case.We do not have the full details on the progress that has been made, but we know some progress has been made, and I am delighted that the NATO summit has had that degree of success. I also note that the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr Balkenende, in his speech to the summit specifically acknowledged the contribution of 'courageous non-NATO allies like Australia'. I appreciate very much the sentiment that was expressed by that fine Prime Minister of the Netherlands.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The reality is that people under these changes are better off. That is the reality. -  - Look at the comparison between AWAs and awards. On average, people on AWAs receive 100 per cent more than those on the relevant award. That is what the data shows in relation to AWAs. We have something like 700,000 people in Australia who are currently on AWAs and more than one million AWAs have been entered into since they came into operation. The reality is that this provides flexibility and incentives for many workers and their families. A person working on an AWA is much more likely to be rewarded for extra performance than somebody on a collective agreement, let alone somebody on an award. That is the reality of the workplace in Australia today. As I said to the member for Perth, we will have a look at this AWA, but I do not take on the say-so of the member for Perth what is in any particular document, because he has been shown to be wrong on so many occasions.</DOC>

 - While members opposite are trying to turn back the tide of economic freedom, this government is getting on with advancing the long-term best interests of our nation. Let me thank the member for Kingston for his question, and let me note a fact which I know pleases him greatly, which is that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has increased by more than 14 percentage points since 'Strengthening Medicare' began. Since 'Strengthening Medicare' began, there has been a 10 percentage point increase in the GP bulk-billing rate right around Australia so that more than three-quarters of all GP consultations are now bulk-billed. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, bulk-billing in New South Wales is up seven percentage points; in Western Australia it is up nine percentage points; in Victoria it is up 10 percentage points; in Queensland it is up 13 percentage points; in South Australia it is up 15 percentage points; and, in the great state of Tasmania the GP bulk-billing rate is up by more than 21 percentage points. That is thanks to the policies of the Howard government.The government are not just on about greater access to bulk-billing doctors. We want to help people who do not get their medical services for free, and that is what we are doing with the Howard government's Medicare safety net, which this year will help 1½ million Australians. Last year, it helped nearly 7,000 people in the electorate of Kingston. By abolishing the safety net, Labor wants to pick people's pockets as they are leaving Medicare offices.I have been asked about alternative policy. The Australian Labor Party used to have a policy, Medicare Gold, which was all about robbing younger Australians to reward older Australians. Now their only policy is to abolish the Medicare safety net. That means ripping off about $200 million a year from the people who most need that money. The member for Lalor's only recent contribution to health policy was to demand about three weeks ago the immediate funding of Gardasil. That would not have brought forward a single inoculation. It would have cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and it would have destroyed the integrity and the credibility of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: do not let your fear of the member for Lalor stop the urgent development of a health policy. Mr Speaker, you do have to feel a bit sorry for the Leader of the Opposition at the moment. Fifty per cent of Australians would prefer a different leadership team and it is not because the member for Lalor and the member for Griffith are any good. The problem that the Leader of the Opposition faces is that he is beset by ambitious careerists who will neither mount a challenge nor rule one out. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you cannot run a credible opposition you could never run an effective government of this country.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I am advised that the Office of Workplace Services is investigating Corish Farms Pty Ltd in relation to some claims that were in the press. So there is an investigation by the Office of Workplace Services. The Leader of the Opposition referred to an investigation by the Office of Workplace Services. This is the very office that he wants to abolish. - It is an office which has recovered more than $30 million in underpaid wages for the workers of Australia and the Leader of the Opposition wants to abolish this office. Worse than that, the officials of the Office of Workplace Services -  - were the very people that the Leader of the Opposition stood at that dispatch box in here and called 'snivelling little liars'. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said about the Office of Workplace Services. The Office of Workplace Services is doing a good job for Australian workers.

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and his interest. I begin by joining with the Acting Prime Minister in expressing my condolences to the families of those affected by the Black Hawk helicopter crash on HMAS Kanimbla. It is important to say that the accident itself was not directly related to the trouble in Fiji except in that the soldiers were deployed to the region in case they were needed to assist fellow Australians.Last night the Fiji military conducted what they described as an 'exercise' in Suva, and soldiers secured parts of the city and fired illumination rounds into the sea. The Fiji military say that this was in order to deter any foreign intervention in Fiji. They may claim that their exercise was successful; nevertheless, to the best of my knowledge there were no plans by any foreign power to intervene in any way at all in Fiji. So I think more realistically the exercise could be described as superfluous.We continue to work with other countries in the region - and I particularly acknowledge New Zealand here - in order to discourage any illegal action and unconstitutional action by the Fiji military in relation to the government. As the House knows, there were discussions in New Zealand yesterday between the military commander and the Fiji Prime Minister; they are now both back in Fiji. They will be resuming discussions, we believe, and we very much hope that, through a process of discussion, the constitution will be upheld, the law will be upheld and the Fiji government will be able to continue to govern according to the democratic principles embraced by that country.Tomorrow I will be participating in a meeting of Pacific Island Forum foreign affairs ministers, which will be chaired by the Papua New Guinea foreign minister. Papua New Guinea is the immediate past chair of the forum and Fiji is currently the chair of the forum, so obviously it would not be appropriate for Fiji to chair the meeting in these circumstances. So we all agree that it will be best for the former chair to take the chair on this occasion. I hope this will be a very useful opportunity for all foreign affairs ministers participating in the meeting to provide their support for the rule of law and constitutional processes.That is important, of course, for Fiji first and foremost but, secondly, it is important for the reputation of the whole of the Pacific. If the Pacific is to have a reputation for instability and unconstitutional behaviour, including by the military, then that damages the whole region and not just Fiji. So I think this is likely to be a constructive meeting and another contribution that can be made to supporting a peaceful and sensible outcome to the differences that people in Fiji might have.</DOC>

 - Dear me, if that is the best he can do. The 165,000 Australians who have got jobs in the last eight months are certainly better off. Under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was last responsible for employment in this country, the unemployment rate was in double digits. - In terms of any guarantee, the Australian people look at the record of political parties. Let us look at the contrast between the political parties. When the Leader of the Opposition was last the minister for employment, it is interesting -  - When the Leader of the Opposition was last responsible for employment -  - It is interesting that, even when he asked the question of me, he could not use the word 'employment' - and why? Because, when he was last responsible for employment - or, indeed, unemployment - in Australia, he said that this was the job he had the least interest in and it was a job that he gave up on. That is the record of this weak Leader of the Opposition. I tell you what cannot be guaranteed: who will be the Leader of the Opposition next week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. It was only a few weeks ago that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was able to launch the first Australian government drought bus - and that has been well received out in the bush. It is very important that we get essential services that are provided through Centrelink and Medicare out to communities that do not have ready access to those sorts of services.In the case of the worst drought in 100 years, it must be recognised that it is very hard for some farmers who have never accessed welfare to walk into a Centrelink office; it can be extremely dispiriting. It is vitally important that we be prepared to make a contribution to their welfare during the worst drought in 100 years by taking services out to them - to go and visit those towns that do not have Centrelink offices or Medicare offices; to go to those places with social workers, with advisers to help them get exceptional circumstances certificates on the spot that allow them to get some money in the bank at a time when they are unable to sell their crops or have to slaughter their sheep in some cases for 25c each. If I were the member for Wills, I would not be joking about this. It is a very serious issue. - The Australian government has committed an additional $1 billion for drought this year, over and above the $1.2 billion that we had committed. I was very pleased to announce with a number of my colleagues today that we are launching a further two drought buses. Drought buses allow us to extend services into Queensland, into the member for Maranoa's electorate and, importantly, into the member for Indi's electorate, covering towns such as Wangaratta and Benalla. It is also vitally important to recognise that these services have to go out to these communities during the summer, at a time when Christmas pressures could have a severe impact.We are now covering - and I am happy to table this document - almost the entire south-eastern seaboard of Australia, covering southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and the electorates of Riverina, Farrer, Indi, Murray, Mallee, Bendigo, McEwen, Gippsland, Eden-Monaro, Calare, Parkes, Gwydir, New England, Groom, Maranoa and Grey. Mr Speaker, if you want a telling indication - and for some people in the city it is very hard to understand the real impact of the drought - in the member for Hume's electorate is the little town of Gunning. In the 1950s and 1960s, Gunning was the fine-wool centre of Australia. As a young boy, I spent a lot of time out at Gunning. Mr Speaker, I can tell you that everyone in Australia has to work hard to ensure that these sorts of towns, which kept Australia going during the 1950s and 1960s, are not forgotten in 2006 and 2007 during the worst drought in 100 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. In answer to the member for Kooyong, yes, I have seen reports about Commonwealth leases of Centenary House, and I took a great interest in those reports.The member for Prospect then left the chamber. - In fact, I took an interest because I remember speaking on this matter in 1992 or 1993, when I was President of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, and revealing the circumstances under which the Australian Labor Party negotiated the lease. In the early nineties the Australian Labor Party thought they would take advantage of incentives to locate headquarters in the ACT. They decided that they would build a building called Centenary House. The problem was that they did not have anybody to put in it, so they negotiated a lease with the then Keating government. It was a 15-year lease and a guaranteed income for that period of time. The interesting thing was that the rent that was negotiated was way over the top of market rents at the time, and it started before the building was even built. By the time the building was actually built but before anybody moved in, the rent had gone up even further.The ratchet clause in the lease was a nine per cent increase per annum for 15 years. The nine per cent was applying even before the Audit Office, whom the Keating government negotiated with for the lease, moved into the building.The member for Fraser then left the chamber. - We have a lease on behalf of the government, but effectively the taxpayer is currently paying $1,100 to $1,200 a square metre, and that does not include outgoings. By 2008, it will be $1,300 a square metre, which is more than what is paid in New York, London or Paris; it is more than the highest rents that you would find in the most expensive cities in the world. If you look at the market rate, you will see that the Australian Labor Party will have had a windfall - and this is over and above the actual market rent - of $42 million over that period of time. This is over and above what should have been paid for fair market rent. It is an average building in Canberra but $42 million was paid for it.The lease will finally run out in 2008 because the Labor Party were embarrassed and sold off the building for a profit, which they obviously put into their campaign funds. They were very happy to disclose those campaign funds, I guess, coming from the taxpayer. A new lease starting in 2008 has been negotiated and it is for $385 a square metre. So the taxpayer will be paying $1,300 a square metre one week and the next week they will be paying $385 a square metre. It is a disgrace. This week we have had lectures from the Labor Party about contracts and morality. It is total hypocrisy on behalf of the Labor Party. They are the ones who have been immoral - The member for Gorton then left the chamber. - The people who have been immoral are the Australian Labor Party, fleecing $42 million from Australian taxpayers. They ought to give it back.</DOC>

 - The government has already taken a large number of very significant measures to end the blame game. In the area of mental health we reached an agreement more than a year ago that both the Commonwealth and the states would increase their commitment. We put our money on the table, and I might say to the Leader of the Opposition that we put our money on the table unconditionally. We said we would spend $1.9 billion more, irrespective of how the states responded. To date, I am sorry to say, not all of the states have responded very well. Victoria is the best. Victoria has matched the Commonwealth to the tune of about 80 per cent of its pro rata share; New South Wales and the ACT, about 70 per cent; Queensland, I think, is about half; Tasmania, Western Australia and the Territory have not contributed any new money.Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the way forward in these areas is cooperative action between the Commonwealth and the states. We had a deal, an understanding, on mental health. We have honoured our share of the agreement. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could talk to his friend the Premier of Queensland and ask the Premier of Queensland to lift from 50 to 100 per cent his obligation under the understanding we reached.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and his interest. The government was very concerned at the statements that were made by Commodore Bainimarama, the commander of the Fiji military force, over the weekend. He is threatening the government - demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister and the government. Yet this is a government that was democratically elected only a few months ago, in May. The election observer team from the Pacific Islands Forum, which included some members of this House, concluded that those elections were free and fair.It is clear that Fiji is on the brink of a coup. This government and I think it is fair to say that this country supports the continuation of the democratically elected government. We support the constitution and we support the rule of law. Last Friday, foreign ministers at the Pacific Islands Forum came together in Sydney. The statement made by those foreign ministers is an important illustration of the unity of the region in support of the constitution, in support of democracy and in support of the rule of law in Fiji. This is not just an Australian or an Australian and New Zealand view. This is the unanimous view of the Pacific Islands Forum.The meeting in Sydney established the Eminent Persons Group, the composition of which is up to the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary-General, Greg Irwin. We are putting forward a retired Australian military officer, and, hopefully, he will be taken up by Greg Irwin and there will be other members of the Eminent Persons Group who will visit Fiji as soon as possible, I would like to feel, before the government has been forcibly removed by the military. The Eminent Persons Group will have an opportunity to engage constructively with all the players there and, hopefully, to assist. But, so far, Commodore Bainimarama is maintaining his rhetoric and his commitment to destroy democracy, to break the country and to undermine its constitution.As a government we warmly welcome the statement made by the United Nations Security Council calling for the military to exercise restraint and to avoid taking any action which would undermine the rule of law and run counter to the best interests of Fiji. The American Department of State has expressed similar sentiments, and the Commonwealth Secretary-General likewise. If Commodore Bainimarama wishes to listen to the voices of the world, the voices of the world are saying, 'Stay with the constitution, stay with the rule of law and allow the democratically elected institutions to do their job.'</DOC>

 - As with all reports of this kind the government will examine it. - No. The member for Hotham is looking happy today. The government will naturally examine that report. Can I say that, historically, the delivery of dental services has been the responsibility of the states. -  - Those who sit opposite talk about ending the blame game. You cannot end the blame game unless both sides of the federal compact discharge the responsibilities which are historically theirs. That is the complaint we have about the states and about the Labor Party in relation to these matters. If you look at health in the broad over the last few years, you can see that the Commonwealth has injected hundreds of millions of dollars into health care. The Labor Party complains about Medicare, yet bulk-billing rates are now back to record levels: they are at record levels for older people and they are at record levels for children under the age of 16. As far as dental services are concerned, the Commonwealth contributes some 30 per cent in rebate for private health insurance and we have increased the rebates for older people. The states are responsible for the dental care of their communities, and it is about time they carried out those responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. He would be well aware of the roads programs that the Commonwealth operates, which deliver significant benefits and assistance to local government. In recent years almost $20 million has been delivered through the Roads to Recovery program to the four councils in the electorate of the member for Cowper. As well, a number of other road projects have been funded by the Commonwealth but are not directly the responsibility of the Commonwealth. As the member knows, that important link between Sawtell and Coffs Harbour, Hogben Drive, is an important piece of local infrastructure and is an indication of what the Commonwealth, our coalition government, is doing to assist the pressures placed upon local councils and local government.There are 650,000 kilometres, or 80 per cent, of all Australians roads which are the responsibility of local government. They have revenue sources from their rates base, and they traditionally have had revenue streams, in both tied and untied grants, from state governments. Historically they have never had direct access to funding from the Commonwealth to look after these roads. But, increasingly, the state governments have moved away. We have heard mention today of cost-shifting. There is a massive amount of cost-shifting that takes place between state governments and local government in the area of roads. The federal government has had to step in to assist local governments in the maintenance of those roads, because road infrastructure right across Australia is vital to the Australian economy. So far, 25,000 local road projects have been funded under Roads to Recovery since we introduced the program in 2001. Almost $2 billion worth of resources has gone into local roads across Australia, not just in regional Australia. These are very important investments for the overall economy, particularly for local economies.The other area we have been engaged in and kept going - and actually revitalised in 1996 - which the member for Cowper would be well aware of, is the National Road Safety Black Spot Program, which was axed in the dying days of the Hawke-Keating government. We reconstituted it, and about $500 million since 1996 has been spent on road black spots, fixing up 4,000 of the most dangerous sections of local roads across Australia. That initiative is directly saving lives, the lives of a lot of young people, across Australia.Last week the Australian Local Government Association had their conference in Canberra. They praised the federal government's commitment to local road infrastructure and have pledged to continue to work with the federal government in this area because it is so important to local economies and, therefore, to the national economy. We should remember that the reason this is necessary is that so many of the state government programs are underfunded as far as assisting local governments in looking after their road networks is concerned. We have seen that need in our communities across Australia. We have stepped into the breach to assist in this area because it is vital to the national economy as well as to the local economies, and it is vital to our task of keeping the national economy strong.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is the historic structure of the Australian economy and the fact that we are now going through an unbroken period of economic growth and expansion. When you have economic growth and expansion, you drag in a lot of imports. The idea that you measure the performance of the Australian economy just by that particular yardstick is very ill-informed.I can also confirm that we have the lowest unemployment in 30 years. I can also confirm for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition that, against an OECD average of net government debt of about 47 per cent, ours sits at zero - despite the inheritance from the person whose policy foundations he so lavishly praised at his inaugural press conference. I can also confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that this country is experiencing the 16th consecutive year of economic expansion. Given the historic structure of the economy, it is not surprising that the factors that he drew attention to should be occurring.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. ANZ job advertisement figures released today showed that job advertisements were down in the month and that the number of advertisements was 5.5 per cent lower than at the same time last year. This should not surprise, because we have seen exceptional job creation through the course of this year. Over the course of the last 12 months we have seen 245,600 new jobs created in Australia, so to see something of a pause would not be a surprise at all.Building approvals data was also released today. Although the data showed that approvals were down in the month of October, it was coming off a strong rise in September. Building approvals are now around 1.8 per cent lower than at the same time last year. This probably illustrates that, after some years of a pause in the housing market, there are tentative signs that housing is beginning to pick up again but not in any unsustainable way. I think most people who look at the economy will see both of these indicators as something of a pause in the strong economic growth we have had for several years. We are also seeing considerable differentiation between the states. Job advertisements were up in Queensland and Western Australia, but there were substantial falls in New South Wales and Victoria, down 4.1 per cent in New South Wales and 5.1 per cent in Victoria. So we are seeing quite an element of differentiation between different parts of Australia.All of this shows that economic management in the year ahead will be challenging, as it always is. The Australian economy is expected to reach $1 trillion in the current financial year - this is a $1 trillion economy, and it takes careful management. And that is what this government does. It engages in strong and careful management of the economy - the kind of management that people need when they are risking their livelihoods and their homes.I will miss the member for Lilley as the spokesman on economic matters for the opposition, as a consequence of today's announcement. I certainly look forward to the member for Lalor becoming the shadow Treasurer. I look forward very much to exchanges with her at the dispatch box in the way that I have had them with her six predecessors since 1996. I would just recommend to her that when  -  - A voice from the grave - the member for Corio! And long may he stay on the front bench. He has every support from this side of the parliament, right through to the time of the next election. - I would recommend that the member for Lalor go carefully in relation to economic management. This is a delicate business, and it takes some considerable skill to manage a $1 trillion economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I am happy to update the Ryan electorate as well as the parliament. Typhoon Durian - it is also known as Typhoon Reming - struck the east coast of the island of Luzon in the Philippines on Friday morning. We believe that over 400 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the typhoon. There are around 400 people missing. According to the Philippines Red Cross, the death toll could rise to around 1,000. Many villages have been buried by mudslides. In total, something like 800,000 people will be affected and 100,000 homes are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed.In a situation like this, involving a near neighbouring country to Australia, it is appropriate that we respond. We have immediately set aside $1 million for humanitarian relief to be distributed through the Philippines Red Cross, UNICEF and the UNDP working in the affected areas. AusAID is working with a number of relief agencies on the ground to help address the issues of a coordination nature that may arise. At this stage, we do not know how much assistance will be needed. As I said, we have set aside $1 million, but it may be that there is more or less for us to do. We certainly have the capacity to provide considerably more assistance if there is a need to do so.Our ambassador has conveyed Australia's condolences to President Arroyo in relation to the typhoon and its impact. President Arroyo has in a speech publicly thanked Australia for the support we have given, as well as for the support we have given in the troubled southern part of the Philippines in Mindanao. As usual, Australia stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance to one of our neighbours. In a situation like this, when so many people in the Philippines are so grievously affected, it is the least that we could do.</DOC>

 - The productivity growth that this country has experienced over the past few years is a product of earlier reforms. One of the reasons that we are reforming industrial relations is to deliver further productivity reform. If the Leader of the Opposition is really committed to lifting productivity, he will alter Labor's backward-looking industrial relations policy. It is fascinating that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me about productivity, because at the core of productivity gains in the future is providing further flexibility for the Australian labour market. That is why we have brought in Work Choices. Yet the Leader of the Opposition, having been told to do so by Sharan Burrow an hour and a half earlier, has recommitted the Australian Labor Party to repealing Work Choices. If Work Choices is repealed, one thing is certain: the productivity gains that this country could otherwise have will be denied to it. It is true that tomorrow's prosperity is a product of today's reform. Today's reform needed to deliver tomorrow's productivity is in part Work Choices. If the Leader of the Opposition wants prosperity tomorrow, he will take the opportunity given to him today of reversing Labor's opposition to Work Choices, embracing the reforms in Work Choices and, thereby, laying the groundwork for further increases in productivity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. In answering it, I note that the unemployment rate in Lindsay now stands at 4.2 per cent. When this government was elected - in other words, when the Labor Party was last in government in 1996 - the unemployment rate in Lindsay stood at 7.3 per cent. In answer to the honourable member's question, it is true that this week a million of Australia's lowest paid award-reliant workers are in receipt of a $27-a-week pay increase. It is the biggest pay increase that has been awarded to the lowest paid workers in Australia. This comes on top of other substantial benefits that have been gained by Australian workers and their families - for example, the 165,000 extra jobs that have been created in Australia since 27 March when Work Choices was introduced, the record low levels of industrial disputation in Australia, the record low retrenchment levels in Australia, the 20-year low of long-term unemployment, and the strong productivity growth.I heard the new Leader of the Opposition ask about productivity growth. The Australian Mines and Minerals Association recently indicated that, because of the workplace relations changes that this government has put in place, there has been a productivity increase in that industry alone of over $6 billion a year. The commercial building and construction industry in Australia has indicated - again as a result of changes made to legislation particularly in relation to the industry - that there has been something like a 20 per cent increase in productivity in this industry. There is a $27-a-week increase to Australia's lowest paid workers, all as a result of the good economic management of this government.I noted that the new Leader of the Opposition has proffered new ideas and a fresh vision. We may have got what seems like an almost biennial makeover of the leadership of the Australian Labor Party but it is quite clear that, even within a couple of hours of a new Leader of the Opposition, it is the same old unions calling the shots in Australia. -  - They laugh, but we had Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU, on the phone to Sky News this morning indicating that she had lined up a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition in order to tell him what the policies of the Australian Labor Party will be so far as industrial relations are concerned, and we had Mr Robertson from New South Wales, whose previous claim to fame was threatening the leadership of the previous Leader of the Opposition to ensure that he made a promise to rip up Australian workplace agreements. Here we had the union movement out once again within minutes, almost, of a new Leader of the Opposition, telling him what his policy would be.And what did he say in his first press conference - this first letter from St Kevin to the people of Australia? What did he say? He said: 'I'm going to implement the policies that have already been put in place.' So what we have are the same tired, old prescriptions. All that is old is new again. What Ms Burrow and Mr Robertson have said is that, basically, there may be a new leader, but it is the same old Labor.</DOC>

 - As was my custom with his predecessor, I always check before I accept as gospel what is quoted by the opposition in relation to statistics. But I can confirm that, since Work Choices was introduced, 165,000 new jobs have been created. I can confirm that unemployment has gone to a 30-year low. I can confirm that industrial disputes are lower now than in 1913, a year before World War I broke out. And I can confirm that, when Labor was in office, real wages recessed by 0.2 per cent. They have risen by 16.4 per cent in the time that we have been in government. I am very happy to confirm all of those facts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I can inform him and the House that, last Friday, seven new drugs were listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and 15 drugs had their availability extended. These new listings will help nearly half a million Australians with diseases such as skin cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and hepatitis B, at a cost of nearly $100 million over the forward estimates period. This latest investment in Australians' health comes on top of new PBS listings since August costing more than $1 billion, including Herceptin, for early-stage breast cancer. It comes on top of last week's placing of the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, on the National Immunisation Program at a cost of some $436 million.The government can only afford to place these new drugs on the PBS and the National Immunisation Program because of the rigorous cost-effectiveness tests applied by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC is what stands between taxpayers and pharmaceutical companies' ambit claims. I note the member for Lalor's shrill demand three weeks ago that the government rip up the recommendations of the PBAC. I note that it would have cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars had that demand been acceded to. I simply say that I hope that the next shadow minister for health turns out to be a lot more economically responsible than the next shadow Treasurer is going to turn out to be.</DOC>

 - I do not think it resonates with the notion of family values to have the dictator of industrial relations policy calling for an example to be presented to her of parents who have lost a child in an industrial accident. That is the sort of -  -  - Let me go to the specific question raised by the Leader of the Opposition. To quote another, Labour, leader: fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. The greatest gift that this government has given to the families of Australia over the last 10½ years has been the dramatic reduction in the level of unemployment. There is no greater cause of family stress and family breakdown than the loss of economic independence brought about through the loss of a job. I would remind the parliament, and I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, that when we had more than a million people out of work in this country the Labor Party was in office. The great gift that this government has brought to the families of Australia and therefore, according to the definition of the Leader of the Opposition, the family values of this country is to put more Australian families back into the workforce.When families have breadwinners, you have families that hold their heads high and you have families that have a sense of security, hope and independence. When you have families that do not have any breadwinners - and there were close to one million of them back in the early 1990s - you have a collapse of family unity and cohesion and a collapse of family morale. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, if he really wants a fair go for families: give them the chance of a job, give the chance of a decent wage increase and give them the chance of success if they want to invest their savings in a small business and aspire to a better future. My view about prospering Australian families is in a nation where people are encouraged to aspire to have a go and to better themselves, not in returning Australia to a union-dominated, rule-ridden past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for being a great champion of RAAF Base Amberley. When Wing Commander Lynda Corbould flew the first of Australia's four C17s into Canberra this morning, it represented a new era for heavy airlift for the Australian Defence Force. In early March this year the Australian government made the decision to invest $2.1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money in acquiring from Boeing four C17 Globemasters, and here we are in early December with the first of those aircraft being delivered. We expect to have the fourth aircraft delivered in 2008.To put it into some perspective, these C17s can carry almost four times the payload of the well-known C130 Hercules, which will nonetheless remain the backbone of Australia's RAAF heavy airlift. For example, if we did have a catastrophe on the west coast of Australia, a C17 could fly from the east coast to the west coast in half the time of a C130 Hercules and carry four times as much equipment. These aircraft, which will service Australia for almost 30 years, will be used extensively not only in Australia in supporting and directly helping Australians but also in our region. If we think of recent deployments in the Solomon Islands, East Timor and other places, it is obvious that Australia and the RAAF need them.Indeed, for our services in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places that are more distant, when you think that a C17 can carry five ASLAVs and 38 personnel, it can carry an M1A1 Abrams heavy tank and a support vehicle and other personnel and it can also carry a Chinook helicopter, a four-wheel drive, a crane and other personnel, it is obvious that our country needs them and it is further evidence that the Australian government is focused not only on Australia's immediate and near-term defence needs but also on the long-term protection and security of our country and its interests on our borders, in our region and across the world. It also should be seen as further tangible evidence of the importance of a very close relationship between Australia and the United States, because the United States Air Force, the Pentagon and others, particularly Boeing personnel, played an extremely important role in the efficient, on-time, on-cost delivery of the first of these four aircraft.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I am saying the policies of this government do in relation to families. The policies of this government have strengthened families. I will get specifically to Work Choices, but the greatest beneficiaries of the government's economic policies over the last 10½ years have been low- and middle-income Australian families. That has been demonstrated not by Liberal Party analysis; it has been demonstrated by NATSEM and by independent economic analysts. Time and time again analysis has shown that the family tax benefits system has been of enormous, incalculable value to low- and middle-income Australian families, the very people to whom the Leader of the Opposition is referring. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to - in your words - tell the parliament what this government has done for Australian families.This government has also enabled Australian families to enjoy the lowest levels of unemployment in the last 30 years. The Leader of the Opposition asked me about the impact of Work Choices. The impact of Work Choices on family working arrangements is beneficial because it has introduced more flexibility. It has allowed Australian families to more adequately mould their requirements and their experiences around the needs of their workplace. In a spirit of reconciliation, I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who tries to contrast market values and family values, that we should not see these things as working against each other; in fact, we should see these things as working in tandem because, unless you have a strong economy, you do not have strong families. A very successful Labor leader had the courage to get his party to alter its historic relationship with the trade union movement as a precursor to winning office. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: until a leader of the Australian Labor Party has the courage to break the domination of the Labor Party by the Australian trade union movement, it will get further and further out of step with the aspirations of modern Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McMillan for his question and I note his interest in this matter. With such a buoyant job market and with unemployment at 4.6 per cent across the nation - I note that it is 4.2 per cent in the honourable member's electorate - there has never been a better time for young people to gain a university qualification. Indeed, young people are taking that option in record numbers.Let me put some facts on the table. Last year over 90 per cent of eligible year 12 students were offered a Commonwealth supported place at a university in their home state. There have been two recent independent reports about the fairness of the student contribution loan scheme - one from the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom and one from La Trobe University. Both reports show that Australia has one of the fairest student contribution loan schemes in the world. There are no up-front fees, 75 per cent of the cost of tuition in a Commonwealth supported place is borne by the taxpayer and repayment is income contingent.The most recent Graduate Career Survey reports that graduates can expect a 100 per cent employment opportunity in a number of disciplines across a number of universities. That same report shows that some graduates' starting salaries are in excess of $65,000. A second recent report, the Graduate Recruitment Survey, shows that across the board, for all university graduates, the median starting salary is $45,700.Through the strong economic management of the coalition government, young people today have more choices and more opportunities. If young people are looking for a job, whether it is through an apprenticeship, a trade or a university qualification, there has never been a better time for them to invest in their education.</DOC>

 - When I make decisions on climate change and the Kyoto protocol, I do not speak for a particular political philosophy; I speak for my country - and it is in my country's interests not to go down the European path. What the Leader of the Opposition has done with that question is reveal the Labor Party's thinking on this issue. It is European based thinking, because he quoted countries whose economies are fundamentally different to Australia's economy. If I applied a British solution to an Australian problem in relation to climate change, I would be doing great injury to my country. I have absolutely no intention of doing that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon very much for his question and acknowledge that he is a great supporter of the superannuation reforms that have been introduced by this government. The government's superannuation policy will set up the next generation in this nation. It is an economically responsible mechanism that will set up an ageing population and will provide support to generations to come. The co-contribution scheme, which was introduced by this government, allows people across this nation who are earning low incomes to put more money into superannuation. Over the last year, about 7,637 people in the electorate of Braddon have benefited from the co-contribution scheme; that is a great outcome for Australian low-income earners.What we know about the superannuation scheme we have put in place, which was announced in the May budget this year, is that we have extended the co-contribution to self-employed people, and they have not been able to benefit from that policy in the past. We have halved the pension assets test taper rate. We have put in place a mechanism of support for people in small business, who now can put money into their superannuation in a way that in the past they have not been able to.Looking at those opposite, we know that the former shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Hunter, has been silent on these issues. We know, of course, that he has been very busy over recent months and it has all come to culmination today. Perhaps it is an opportunity for his successor to look at superannuation - at least for somebody on the Labor front bench to please look at superannuation and to provide some comment, some support for superannuation. What the Australian people face now is a decision between old Labor with a new salesman and this side of the House -  - which is going to set up the economic future of this country. It is a very stark contrast, and it is an opportunity for the Labor Party now at last -  - to come out and support superannuation.</DOC>

 - I am sure that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is well aware of the issues raised by the honourable member. Indeed, he has responded on a number of occasions. You will be aware that there are amendments proposed to the EPBC Act, which will make it possible to deal with some of those sorts of issues. It is a difficult exercise to balance the importance of conserving Australia's native life with enabling farmers to routinely and properly go about their business. The government seeks to achieve that balance and to put in place legislation that is both workable and effective but fair to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. Of course, Bonner is now experiencing 4.3 per cent unemployment rates - below the national average. That region, in 1996, experienced of course over seven per cent. It is an extraordinary change. It is a fact that, since we were elected in 1996, the John Howard government has helped create over 1.9 million jobs. Under Labor, of course, unemployment peaked at one million people out of work. Just to give you another example, Job Network has placed more people in jobs in the last six months than Labor achieved under their Working Nation policy in the last six years before 1996.As for debilitating, soul-destroying, long-term unemployment rates, they are now 75 per cent less than when Labor was in office. They peaked under Labor, of course. We have reduced those long-term unemployment rates by 75 per cent. Last week, when the ACTU invited the workers of Australia to go on strike and they walked themselves off into the MCG, if they had looked around at the empty seats they could have done a calculation and said, 'Labor's long-term unemployed could have filled the MCG three times over and there would still have been enough long-term unemployed to fill the WACA.'For parents on pensions in the last 12 months there has been a 40 per cent increase in employment rates. As the PM said a short time ago, when parents on pensions get employment, so do their children. We have managed to break the intergenerational cycles of poverty, when parents on pensions also saw their kids enter unemployment year after year. We have helped kids get jobs. Labor left 600,000 families without a breadwinner. Welfare to Work policies have helped the disabled, the mature aged, Indigenous people, youth and prisoners into work at rates we have never seen before in Australia. They have been extraordinarily successful.But I am asked what the alternatives are. It is very important to know what the alternatives are for the unemployed who are left in Australia. Labor gave us Working Nation. What was the success rate of Working Nation? Four per cent - four per cent outcomes under Working Nation. And, for each one of those placements, the cost was 10 per cent more than under our Welfare to Work initiatives. Under Working Nation, they put people into mickey mouse courses that disguised the unemployment rate somewhat but which left people unskilled and not job ready. That was significant because, of course, under Labor, school retention rates plummeted, youth unemployment peaked and we lost a generation of tradespeople. -  - It was appalling - school retention down six per cent. Labor recently put out a thing they have called the Blueprint for Prosperity. This was just last week. Buried within the prosperity blueprint we have the shadow of an employment strategy. Is this a clear, bold enunciation of policy? Is it a fork in the road? Is it a forklift or a pitchfork? Is there a fork in it? No, no forks. In fact, we have, in the blueprint for employment under Labor, a reprint of Working Nation - the failed, appalling Working Nation which the OECD independently evaluated and whose impact, it said, was 'strongly negative'. So it is very unfortunate that we are no better off under Labor's blueprint, it would seem. Those who are unemployed, of course, are in a position in Australia now where they can look forward to work and they can enjoy the prosperity of this nation, and our businesses can get on and grow and prosper.</DOC>

 - This country has a health system that essentially operates at three levels. There are those areas where, overwhelmingly, responsibility rests with the Commonwealth, and that is Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is fair to say that the best friend Medicare has ever had has been the Howard government. My colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing has just announced a major revamping of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that is going to save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars over the years ahead. It is also going to mean that life-saving drugs are affordable and available. They are some of the areas where the Commonwealth has exclusive responsibility.Another area is private health insurance. Labor is fundamentally opposed to private health insurance. The member for Lalor, who is still the spokesman on this matter, has made that very clear. It will be very interesting to see whether the dream team jettisons the commitment of the Labor Party against private health insurance. So they are areas where we have exclusive responsibility.There are areas where the states have exclusive responsibility - for example, the operation of public hospitals. Although we provide about 43 per cent of the funding, the states run them. There are areas where the states and the Commonwealth need to cooperate. Over the last year the levels of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states in some of these areas have even drawn critical comment from both sides of politics. I have been mildly upbraided by some of my colleagues in the states for being so cooperative with Labor premiers. Some of them have privately confessed to me that they have had a bit of stick from some of you on the front bench for being so cooperative with me. Premiers conferences, to quote the Premier of Queensland, seem to get better and better. The halcyon days of Commonwealth-state cooperation in these areas are the days of the last 12 months of the Howard government.Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Yes, you can always do better.' We can all do better. But this government has gone out of its way to cooperate with the states. Yesterday I mentioned mental health, where the states are dragging the chain. They have not come up to the crease with their share. We put in $1.9 billion. I want the states to match every last dollar of that - that was the agreement. Queensland is only 50 per cent; the best performing state is Victoria, at 80 per cent; South Australia and Western Australia, ACT and Northern Territory, nothing extra. So let me say to those who sit opposite: talk to your state colleagues and get them to fully cooperate with us and we will have a much better health system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. I can inform the House that the balance of payments figures for September 2006 were released today. They showed a narrowing of the current account deficit, which has fallen to around 4.9 per cent - possibly less - of GDP, which is significantly lower than forecast in the budget, at 6.25 per cent. The good news is that in current price terms exports increased 1.3 per cent in the quarter and in current price terms imports fell 2.5 per cent in the quarter. The improvement in the trade deficit more than offset the rise in the net income deficit, which was driven principally by the fact that foreign corporations are deemed to repatriate profits that they make in Australia, particularly mining companies.Net foreign debt increased to $522 billion in the September quarter, but only a very small part of that is held by the Commonwealth government - 5.1 per cent, compared to 17.2 per cent in the March quarter of 1996. The Commonwealth is not borrowing in net terms; it is issuing growth securities in Australia. Some of those securities would be bought by foreigners. That is the only way in which the Commonwealth would hold any foreign liabilities at all. Importantly, the debt servicing ratio is at 9.8 per cent in the September quarter, well below the peak of 20 per cent, in 1990.One of the intriguing matters that has been going on over the last 24 hours is the 'guess the shadow Treasurer' competition. We still have not had an announcement. I think the member for Lilley still formally holds the post. Members would have seen footage of the member for Lilley at a dinner with fellow roosters last night - one of those dinners where there were more bottles of wine on the table than people sitting up for the meal. It looked like it was going to be a bad night in roosterville last night. There had been a coup in the coop - what they call a 'coop d'etat'. And the guessing game continues as to whether the 'coop d'etat' will lead to the member for Melbourne or whether it will lead to the member for Lalor -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. It really goes to the heart of an understanding of what the Australian economy is doing at the present time. I can do no better than to quote from the most recent report on the Australian economy by the International Monetary Fund, in which they say:In conclusion, the sustained current account deficit reflects private sector choices rather than public sector developments. Moreover, high levels of investment are the main cause of Australia's historical and recent current account deficits. The investment nature of the external deficit is a source of comfort for Australia, especially as indicators such as corporate profitability suggest that investments are generating solid returns.The statistics released today show that Australia's foreign debt was $522 billion in the September quarter 2006, and 98 per cent of that is attributable to the private sector. The reason that 98 per cent is attributable to the private sector is that we no longer run budget deficits in this country. We stopped doing that years ago. We inherited, dare I say, a 'bucketload' of debt when we faced that 'fork in the road' in March 1996 and we went down the path of debt retirement and the elimination of budget deficits. As a result, our foreign liabilities are 98 per cent accounted for by the private sector. It is all about the nature of the economy. It is all about the fact that, historically, this country has imported foreign capital. We are running a very strong investment economy and, as the IMF reports, that is a source of comfort for Australia, not a source of concern.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I know how deeply she feels for her constituents who are suffering from arguably the worst drought that Australia has ever had. We are now aware that over 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural land has been declared in drought exceptional circumstances and, therefore, the people who live in those areas are eligible for assistance from the Commonwealth government.Importantly, we have not welshed on our responsibility to support farmers in need during this drought. Almost 95 per cent of the support given to the rural communities in those areas is coming from the federal coalition government. That spending could be up towards $7-odd million per week to assist those families to keep food on the table and with basic household support, and, just as importantly, with interest rate subsidies to ensure that their farming businesses get through the devastation of drought so that they are there to produce for the economy in the future. These are the two key elements that are part of our drought exceptional circumstances support and the package we announced early in the piece to give confidence to the rural sector.Also, last month the government announced that it would extend exceptional circumstances support to small businesses in drought affected communities which derive over 70 per cent of their income from the agricultural community. That is relief for an estimated 5,000 businesses, which range from contract harvesters to feed producers and fertiliser suppliers. We have extended that support to the business community to ensure that the economic and social fabric in those rural communities, such as in the Riverina, are held together during this drought.I mentioned that our government is providing about 95 per cent of the support going to rural communities during this drought. We should not let the state Labor governments off the hook in their responsibilities to assist their communities. Whilst the state governments across Australia continue to shift costs, we will continue to shift the blame onto them so that people will know about the responsibilities they are abrogating. We know what has been going on in New South Wales: it was made very public at the time of our announcement of our measures to support drought-stricken farmers that some of the assistance we were providing through interest rate support the New South Wales government were trying to claw back in water charges to irrigators in New South Wales, who were not receiving any of the water. The New South Wales government should hang their heads in shame for that, and they should do more to support the farming community in New South Wales.We know what the Victorian government did during the 2002-03 drought, when they promised measures in the lead-up to the election in 2002: straight after the election, when they had been re-elected, they withdrew those measures. So we are watching the Bracks government very closely as to what they are doing about their announced measures and commitments to farmers suffering from drought in regional Victoria. Let there be no mistake about this: the public in Australia need to know that the state Labor governments are not currently doing their bit to help out the rural communities of Australia.We are a wealthy nation that has prospered because of the good economic management from the federal coalition government. That has given us the ability to continue to support our regional communities in the way that we have. We are not going to stand by and let the state Labor governments not do their bit in their areas of responsibility or, in terms of the New South Wales government, try to claw back some of the financial assistance that we are providing to farmers in their hour of need.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and his interest. It is clear that that there is what you might describe as a 'creeping coup' taking place in Fiji. Commodore Bainimarama is increasingly gaining control of Fiji. I can only say that we in the Australian government regard that as a tragedy. We strongly condemn the attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government - a government that was elected during the course of this year in a free and fair election, as observed by a number of members of this House.Commodore Bainimarama has given many reasons for wanting to remove a democratically elected government. But I note with interest that one of his reasons - one of his demands - is the dropping of investigations into the commander of the Republic of Fiji military force, Commodore Bainimarama. There are investigations into Commodore Bainimarama himself and other senior officers in relation to the death of five army officers in November 2000. Commodore Bainimarama has continually demanded that the government terminate these investigations. These investigations are being conducted by the Fiji police. If the investigations come to a conclusion and it is then referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, then that is a matter that should be considered by him. And if there is to be a prosecution, that is a matter that should be considered by a court. That is normal in any law abiding country. But Commodore Bainimarama is demanding - and it is one of his nine or so demands - that these investigations cease, and of course the Prime Minister has refused to do that.Commodore Bainimarama might like to be reminded that the response from the international community to a coup will be swift and it will be sharp. There will be severe consequences for Fiji's economy and for its standing internationally if this coup continues. We have made it very clear - as have the New Zealanders, very importantly, as well as the Americans, the British, the EU and others - that we will be taking measures against Fiji. The UN, the Commonwealth and the EU have all urged restraint, but it seems that Commodore Bainimarama is impervious to good advice.If this coup proceeds and the Prime Minister and his government are forced to resign - and it increasingly looks as though that will be the case - then we will ban all travel to Australia by Commodore Bainimarama, his family and other supporting members of the Republic of Fiji military forces. We will ban all travel to Australia by people and their families who participate in an unconstitutional government that might be set up to replace the democratically elected government. We will also immediately suspend all aspects of our defence cooperation program with Fiji, and we will encourage other countries to impose similar penalties. I know that New Zealand, whose circumstances with Fiji are a little different from ours, will in effect do similar things.The Secretary-General of the United Nations has warned of implications for the standing of Fiji military personnel in international peacekeeping. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group will meet to consider Fiji's suspension from the Commonwealth during the course of next week. I note also that, in October this year, Fiji assumed the chairmanship of the Pacific Islands Forum. It is hard to see, if this coup continues, how Fiji could continue to chair an organisation which has called for the continuation of democratically elected governments. Also, we particularly condemn the activities of the President of Fiji, who appears to have thrown his support behind an illegal coup, instead of upholding the constitution, the rule of law and the democratically elected government.Finally, in relation to Australians in Suva, those who are concerned about their safety should consider leaving. We have Australian Defence Force personnel at the ready to assist with their departure if that proves to be necessary. At this stage, we do not expect there to be substantial outbreaks of violence which might affect Australians or that Australians will be targeted. But, having said that, we should not be complacent. We should make sure that we focus very much on ensuring that Australians are safe and that we have the assets ready to protect them and to evacuate them if that proves necessary.</DOC>

 - I am absolutely certain that the member for Fairfax would mean anything he said, because he speaks for his Queensland constituents with great eloquence. But I would have thought that what the Leader of the Opposition said is a very significant indictment of the Queensland Labor government. It is as simple as that. In the time that we have been in office, we have dramatically increased our spending on health. Just over one-fifth of the federal budget is to be spent on health and ageing in 2006-07. That is more than double the figure 10 years ago. GP bulk-billing rates are up to 76.9 per cent. We have spent more than $4 billion over five years on 'Strengthening Medicare', including the payments for bulk-billing children and concessional patients, and the safety net now covers 80 per cent of out-of-pocket non-hospital costs above the threshold. The Labor Party is against the safety net. - The minister for education says, 'That's right.' She confirms that Labor is against the safety net. The safety net has been a life raft to Middle Australian families because it means that, if you have an unexpected accident - if one of your children has a broken limb, you have to take them to consultations and you incur expenses over and above the normal - once you hit a very modest level of a few hundred dollars, you get back 80 per cent of everything you have had to outlay on that injury. Labor wants to abolish that. I cannot think of anything that would hurt the constituents of Fairfax more than the abolition of the safety net. Talking about the blame game: to abolish the safety net is to blame the patient for getting injured, and that basically is what Labor is all about. I suggest that, before the Leader of the Opposition asks further questions about health, he does a speed-reading course of his own party's policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question. I can tell him that the government's simplified superannuation scheme is to take effect on 1 July next year, and the legislation will be introduced into this House this week. We are yet to hear from the Labor Party whether it actually supports simplified superannuation. The reforms will sweep away a host of complex tax provisions. They will improve incentives to save. They will increase retirement incomes, and they will strengthen incentives for older Australians.In the vast majority of cases, for the 90 per cent of Australians in taxed superannuation schemes, there will only be one provision of the law that applies to them - the provision that says that, after 60 years of age, there will be no tax on their end benefits, no tax on their lump sums and no tax on their pensions. For an Australian who retires after 60 and whose superannuation is in a taxed fund - which 90 per cent of Australians are in - that is the end of their taxation liabilities. As the superannuation industry itself has noted, this is the biggest reform to superannuation in its history. This makes superannuation comprehensible, and it increases incentives to save.In addition to that, there will be a 10 per cent tax offset for those who are in untaxed funds so as to give them near equivalent treatment to the abolition of taxes for those coming out of taxed funds. There will be a halving of the pensions assets taper test, from $3 to $1.50 per fortnight, which means that, for many Australians on the pension who are currently asset tested out of the pension or out of part of a pension, they will have the opportunity to continue under a much fairer assets test.The reforms will provide extensive benefits for the self-employed - a 100 per cent tax deduction - so that those self-employed Australians who want to put away money for their retirement will have full equivalent taxation treatment, as they would have if they were employees and they could get a full tax deduction for their contributions.It is important that these reforms go through the House with bipartisan support. Let me explain why. If these reforms are opposed by the Labor Party then people will not have confidence to lock away money - in some cases for 20, 30 or 40 years - because of the fear that Labor could get elected at any time in the next 20, 30 or 40 years and could change the taxation system adversely against them. We need to have a clear and unequivocal statement from the Labor Party that they will not interfere with this foresight, with this far-reaching reform to superannuation, so that Australians can have confidence to save. I call upon the new Leader of the Opposition to put aside the failures of the opposition up until now, to come out and make it clear, to state in unequivocal terms that these reforms will be kept in place under any future Labor government, because Australians need the certainty to invest in their superannuation.</DOC>

 - Let me say a couple of things about the sale of Medibank Private. It has been an enunciated and longstanding policy of the government and it is appropriate that the legislation go through. The government has explained its reasons. We believe that it will contribute to the strengthening of private health insurance. We believe in more competition. We believe in private health insurance. The Labor Party believes in neither.In relation to The blame game report, in a federation where areas of responsibility are divided between the Commonwealth and state, the Commonwealth should properly fund its responsibilities and the states should properly fund their responsibilities and the two levels of government should cooperate in areas where joint service delivery is required. If you look at the policy and practice of this government, you see that that is what has occurred. Moreover, we have endowed the states, through the GST, with unprecedented levels of revenue for them to spend according to their own discretionary judgement. The Leader of the Opposition talks about cooperative federalism. I am informed by the Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, the member for Fairfax, that the Queensland government refused to cooperate in the compilation of that report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. In answering it, I note that the unemployment rate in the electorate of Kalgoorlie stands at 3.4 per cent - 3.4 per cent in that vast electorate covering much of Western Australia. That is good news for tens of thousands of workers and the families in the electorate of Kalgoorlie.The member for Kalgoorlie asked me about an estimate from the Australian Mines and Metals Association - the association which represents all major mining and resource operators in this country and therefore an association which is very much at the core of the economic success of Australia at the present time. AMMA has estimated that the resources sector alone in Australia would lose between $6.6 billion and $9.9 billion of export revenue annually if Australian workplace agreements were abolished - up to almost $10 billion annually in lost revenue by this policy to abolish Australian workplace agreements. - We have a robust economy which has been created by good economic management, by dint of hard work of this government and the people of Australia, and that has led to these sorts of outcomes for the Australian economy and Australians. Yet at every turn the Leader of the Opposition, the Labor Party and the unions have opposed the reforms that have brought about this economic powerhouse in Australia. On the one hand we have the opposition opposing all the reforms that have brought about economic success to Australia and on the other hand we have the Howard government putting in place a framework of opportunity that has been to the benefit of Australian workers and their families.For families this has meant improved wages; it has meant 165,000 new jobs created in the last eight months in Australia - not just the 3.4 per cent unemployment rate in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. We have seen people making use of expanded opportunities for themselves and being increasingly prepared to take risks in expanding their businesses - small businesses, microbuisnesses, medium businesses and large businesses. If we want to continue to enjoy the fruits of this prosperity in Australia, we have to be prepared to allow people to succeed - to allow people to get out and have a go, as they have over the last 10 years. That is what Australians are doing increasingly because of the economic framework that has been put in place in this country. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has recommitted the Labor Party to abolishing Australian workplace agreements, which, in a single stroke, would wipe out up to $10 billion worth of export revenue from the resource sector of Australia. -  - The reaction of members opposite paints a very stark picture. They are prepared to joke about and mock the mining industry in Australia - one which, on the other hand, they claim is the basis of our economic performance at the present time. Why would they abolish these agreements? We heard again yesterday - even before the new Leader of the Opposition had been selected by the Labor Party caucus - Sharan Burrow on the airwaves saying clearly, 'There won't be any change in the industrial relations policy.' We have had John Robertson and Joe de Bruyn, all the heavies from the labour movement, saying, 'Kevin Rudd, the Leader of the Opposition, will do what we tell him.' This would be disastrous for Australia. Labor cannot be trusted to keep the Australian economy strong. The reality is that there may be a new leader but it is the same old Labor.</DOC>

 - I think the blame game should stop, and the blame game stops when each level of government properly funds and properly operates -  - the responsibilities given to it by the Australian Constitution. That is where you stop the blame game. Let me make it very clear. My colleague - my esteemed colleague, my valued colleague; a colleague for whom I have great affection - the Minister for Health and Ageing has said things about the Commonwealth taking over public hospitals. That is not my view. I believe state hospitals are best run by state governments, and if you are interested in cooperative federalism the last thing you do is give total responsibility to the Commonwealth government for fundamental areas like health. - If you moved all of health and all of education to the federal government, you might as well wind up the federation. Let us inject a little bit of reality. I have never disguised the fact that if we were starting this country again we would not have the system of government we have, with states and the Commonwealth, but we are not starting it again. We are charged with the pragmatic responsibility of making the thing work well. You make it work well, irrespective of the political composition of the governments in power at a state and federal level. You make it work well by the Commonwealth doing the things it is meant to do, and we are certainly doing that with Medicare.Nobody knows that better than the member for Lalor. She has been pretty quiet on Medicare over the last couple of years. My colleague has done such a good job - with a lot of help from the Treasurer, who has written out quite a number of cheques for Medicare - that we are the best friend Medicare has. We are the only friend that private health insurance has. Private health insurance is an orphan as far as Labor is concerned. My advice to the member for Lalor, the putative spokesperson on industrial relations - I do not think she is going to do Treasury - is: if you want the federation to work better, stick to your last. Get the states to do better what they are meant to do. Follow what we are doing - get the states to better fund their responsibilities in areas like health and education - and we will all live happily ever after.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and I note the extremely thoughtful and intelligent report that his committee has produced. I also observe that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has increased by almost 10 percentage points in the last year. So, whatever is going wrong with state public hospitals in the electorate of Fairfax, there is nothing wrong with federally run health programs in this area.This government does not just talk about Medicare; it invests the money needed to make a good system even better - no less than $48 billion in health and ageing programs in the current financial year. Since Strengthening Medicare was introduced in December 2003, nationally the GP bulk-billing rate has gone up by more than 10 percentage points and overall bulk-billing rates are now significantly higher than they were in 1996. Since 2003, GP bulk-billing rates in Queensland have increased by almost 13 percentage points. All this seems to have escaped the new Leader of the Opposition, who earlier this year said that bulk-billing rates in his electorate continued to head in the wrong direction. In fact, since 2003 the GP bulk-billing rate in Griffith has increased by more than six percentage points; so I suggest that one fork in the road that the new Leader of the Opposition might be inclined to take is to tell the truth in health - or perhaps that is a bridge too far for him.Yesterday the opposition leader promised that Labor would have some new health policy in the days ahead, and I want to congratulate him for this, because since Medicare Gold was ignominiously withdrawn Labor has officially been a health policy free zone, for more than 200 days. He could start, as the Prime Minister has said, by pledging support for the Howard government's Medicare safety net, which last year helped nearly 12,000 people in his own electorate. I can understand why the new Leader of the Opposition is terrified of making the author of Medicare Gold his shadow Treasurer, but the member for Lalor should not be allowed to wimp out of this challenge. She should not be allowed to wimp out of the challenge of being the shadow Treasurer. She should be given the chance to shine in Treasury, just like she shone in health - and hasn't she shone in health? I leave it to caucus members opposite to judge just how brilliant she has been.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the government has clearly indicated from the outset on this very important issues, as far as wheat growers are concerned, we are going to consult widely with the industry. We have the tried and true mechanisms for seeking the views of growers both directly and indirectly through their peak body organisations, many of whom have been working with the government over a period of time during the course of this year.I can assure the member, all members of the House and particularly the wheat growers of Australia that the government is not going to take any decisions in terms of locking in future arrangements until we have drawn in the views of all players in the industry. I did say at the press conference that the views of growers are the most important thing, because it is the wheat growers of Australia whose product we are talking about and not the entities that manage it or market it; it is the growers and their families who are important here. In many parts of Australia they are currently facing extreme circumstances with the drought, and the government are certainly going to look after their interests with what we do as we move forward in this very challenging circumstance. So, of course, we will use all the mechanisms available to us to seek the views of growers, industry organisations and industry representatives.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and acknowledge his very strong support of the uranium industry in Australia and also the fact that 100 per cent of uranium exports in Australia are shipped through the port of Darwin. - That is the Labor Party for you, isn't it? It is no secret that uranium is emerging as one of Australia's promising export industries. - Martin, we know what you said. It is in the report and I am going to quote it in a minute. Australia's uranium exports have reached a record $573 million in 2005. Of course, Australia has bucketloads of uranium - some 40 per cent of the world's known uranium reserves and the potential to take an even larger share of this export pie.Despite all this potential, Australia's future as a uranium exporter is by no means assured. A recent ABARE report identified 13 uranium projects in Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia that are stalled by state Labor laws and regulations, which are supported, of course, by the federal Labor Party. Without changes to these Labor policies, ABARE estimates that Australia's share of the booming global market for uranium will fall to just 19 per cent by the year 2015. Clearly, reform is needed. As usual, when the Labor Party faces a policy challenge, it is divided. In one corner we have the member for Grayndler, who continues to cling to an outdated no new mines policy. - Of course, in the other corner is the member for Batman, who yesterday, with his colleagues the member for Blaxland and the member for Lyons, backed the finding of the bipartisan report into Australia's uranium industry. This report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources unanimously concluded:... the current restrictions on uranium mining are illogical, inconsistent and anticompetitive.The report goes on to say:Restrictions have impeded investment in the industry, and have resulted in a loss of regional employment and wealth creation opportunities ... The only beneficiaries of restrictions are the three existing producers and foreign competitors.The report goes on to say:... state policies that prevent development of new uranium mines should be lifted and legislative restrictions on uranium mining and exploration should be repealed.To borrow a phrase, the Labor Party has reached a fork in the road. It has to choose between continuing with an ideology that is completely outdated and irrelevant or following what we on this side of the House believe in: allowing the uranium industry to expand and create exports, jobs and opportunities for Australians.</DOC>

 - Let me say that I have had every confidence in the ministers responsible for agriculture who have served in my government. It is no accident that all of the agricultural areas of Australia and all of the great wheat-growing areas of Australia are represented by either members of the Liberal Party or members of the National Party. That says something about the attitude of the people who count.I am aware of the policy that we took to the last election. I am also aware, as I have said repeatedly, of the need, especially in the wake of the Cole inquiry, to look again at our marketing arrangements. I am intrigued if implicit in the Leader of the Opposition's question is the idea that the status quo should be absolutely maintained without any change. That is a very, very interesting proposition. No doubt we will hear a little bit more.But, as the Deputy Prime Minister and I announced this morning after the joint party meeting had approved the government's proposals, there will be a period of very extensive consultation. All of the options will be on the table and, after we have consulted people, we will make a decision. In the meantime we are going to legislate - and I would assume that the Labor Party will support this legislation - to transfer the veto, which now is held by the AWB(I), for a period of six months to the minister. He will exercise that power, that discretion, as appropriate in consultation with senior ministers. This, in fact, is to put the government in a proper position to deal with the situation of Western Australian wheat growers and the concerns they have about current export arrangements.I assume that the Labor Party will vote in favour of this change, because this change will facilitate a resolution of the issue which is of concern to Western Australian wheat growers but in a manner that is fair to other wheat growers in other parts of Australia who have delivered their bulk wheat into the pool under current arrangements. I am fascinated, because implied in that question from the Leader of the Opposition is his belief that we should not even look at the existing arrangements, even in the wake of the Cole inquiry. I am staggered that that should be the view of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his very strong and passionate advocacy for the families in his electorate of Kingston, in areas such as Seaford, Morphett Vale and Hallett Cove. He recognises that it is important that you have to do more than just speak about family values; you have to deliver for Australian families.From 1 January, many of the families in his electorate, and many from around Australia, will benefit from a range of increases to payments, such as the 366,000 people who receive the carer allowance. They will receive an increase to $98.50 per fortnight for that caring responsibility. Recipients of Austudy will have an increase. This will assist some 29,000 students, while 274,000 students receiving a youth allowance will also receive an increase. Twenty-one thousand single people under the age of 21 receiving the disability support pension will also receive a fortnightly increase. There will be increases to the double orphan pension and the mobility allowance. All of these are very significant and important additional resources and assistance being provided to these families, and it is a practical way in which the Howard government can assist them.Also from 1 January, legislation ensuring a fairer assets test to those living in rural and regional parts of Australia comes into effect. Commonly known as curtilage, this very practical measure will help aged pensioners, carer payment recipients and the veterans community to be able to stay on the properties that they have lived in for over 20 years, where they have a close affinity with that land, and not have more than two hectares used towards the assets test. This measure alone will help some 10,000 people, who will benefit directly from being able to stay in the house that they have been a part of for such a long time, and not reduce their benefits through Centrelink.Of course, as the member for Kingston knows, the Howard government now is delivering over $16 billion in family tax benefits, another $9.5 billion over the next four years in support for child care and a range of other very practical measures on the ground assisting families, strengthening them through things such as the Stronger Families and Communities program. Our tax system under the Howard government is unapologetically supportive of Australian families. I say to the opposition and I say to all Australians that the Howard government do not just talk about family values; we deliver in a very practical manner to Australian families, providing them with the opportunities to build a better future for their children.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no. In fact, it is no, no, no. The slightly longer answer is that, if you look at the aggregate benefits of our industrial relations changes over the last 10½ years, they are manifestly pro family. I have never made the assertion that the only people in the community who are interested in happy and stable families are members of my two parties; family life is important to all Australians. I would not be so absurd as to make a claim to the contrary. But I do make the entirely reasonable claim that over the last 10½ years we have deliberately followed policies which have been designed to help Australian families.One of the oddest claims that have been made over the past few days is that we have followed some kind of social Darwinism in our attack on Australian families. Indeed, the reverse is the case. I have occasionally read some commentators, who could loosely be called to be on the economic right of the debate in Australia, attack me for having been too generous to Australian families. They have attacked the family tax benefit system and they have attacked some of our childcare policies, but I welcome those attacks because they have been a reminder that the government I lead has governed very much for the great mainstream of Australian families. If you look at the way in which our family tax benefits have burgeoned, if you look at the extraordinary performance in the area of unemployment and if you look at the fundamental changes to Medicare which have been outlined by me and the health minister over the last few minutes - the boosting of bulk-billing, the introduction of the Medicare safety net and the funding of private health insurance - all of these measures, so far from undermining families, have been profoundly pro family.I have said before, and I will repeat it again, that the proudest boast that I was able to make in the last election campaign was when I opened the Liberal Party's campaign in Western Sydney and I said that under the government I led we had done more for the workers of Australia than a Labor government could ever have dreamt to have done. We had given them lower interest rates, we had given them lower taxation, we had given them and their children more jobs and we had boosted family support. I welcome any debate on support for families because nothing has driven me more consistently over the last 10 years than a desire to profoundly advantage the families of Middle Australia. It has meant more to me than anything else and it remains at the core of my political being. I welcome any debate on that particular ground.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question because it gives me an opportunity to demonstrate that the government's approach in relation to families is not one-dimensional. We have rolled out the first 15 of some 65 family relationship centres. I might say that they have been extremely well received. In the first four months of operations, those centres have received over 13,600 phone calls, had 3,700 people visit a centre, conducted more than 5,300 interviews and intake sessions and had more than 1,900 dispute resolution sessions. We are currently in the evaluation phase for tenders for the next 25 centres, including, I might say, the centre proposed for Launceston in the electorate of the member for Bass.The government is delivering on its promise to provide important services to Australian families. Despite the rhetoric from the doomsayers on the other side, the next 25 family relationship centres are on track to open on time, just like the first 15. While others have focused on attacking the rollout of these valuable services, we have been working hard to ensure that they are available to as many people as possible. We have certainly seen the hard work of staff at the centres to ensure that that has happened, and that is to be commended. Notwithstanding Labor's criticism of these centres from day one, experience has shown that they have been embraced by the community. The community has welcomed our vision and realised that we are the only ones willing to tackle the difficult issues relating to family law reform, keeping families together and, if that is not possible, resolving as amicably as possible issues that might be in contention. I urge all members, particularly those opposite, to embrace the next round of tenders, which will see these valuable services available to even more Australians.</DOC>

 - I am generally aware of that report. I am also generally aware of the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. The Leader of the Opposition is inviting a debate on the relative position of Australian families. He attacks our Work Choices legislation without acknowledging in any way a number of fundamental changes that have occurred in the Australian community over the last 10½ years. The fact is the foundation of economic security for any family is a secure job for the breadwinner. As Tony Blair rightly said, and it should pass into the federal political lexicon in this country, fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.On that measurement, there has been no fairer government to the families of Australia than the government I have led over the last 10½ years because the relative improvement in unemployment in this country has been more dramatic under this government than under any government, I believe, since the end of World War II. If you go beneath those figures we see other improvements. Long-term unemployment was the lowest on record in October of 2006. This is the hardcore unemployed. There are thousands of children living in families that still have two parents out of work. The long-term unemployment rate is the lowest on record and it is 117,000 lower than it was 10 years ago. In families with children under 15 years, joblessness has fallen from 18.9 per cent in 1993 to some 14.1 per cent now. We have seen dramatic increases in real wages.May I remind those who sit opposite that, when they last had the responsibility for caring for Australian families, the real wages of those families fell by 0.2 per cent over a period of 13 years. What sort of justice did Labor deliver to the one million people who were thrown out of work with the recession we had to have? We have seen a rise of 16.4 per cent since March 1996 in the level of real wages in this country.The great virtue of our industrial relations policy is that it has laid the groundwork for further prosperity into the future. It is the case that tomorrow's prosperity can only be built off the back of today's reforms. Those who would wind back our reforms are condemning us to a less prosperous future. We brought in Work Choices because we believed it would add to the strength and productivity of the Australian economy. The evidence to date bears that out - the number of additional jobs, the fall in strikes and the continued increase in real wages. Those who believe in a secure, prosperous future support Work Choices. Those who would take us back to a union dominated past oppose it. The Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly clear that he falls into the latter category.</DOC>

 - I would like to recognise the member for Hasluck as the best member for Hasluck ever. - That is a very good endorsement - thank you, Treasurer! The Howard government distributes over $50,000 a minute to Australian families, particularly through Centrelink and Medicare offices. That includes $15 billion in family tax benefit, $6 billion in parenting payments, $1.6 billion in childcare benefit and, of course, the $1 billion in the baby bonus - to 250,000 newborn Australians receiving $4,000 each. - One for the country, and that is very important. That is children, not wives! That, of course, does not include carer payments, the Medicare safety net or the childcare tax rebate. They are all in addition to the $50,000 a minute that we distribute.We want to make it more convenient for Australian families to access these sorts of services. That is why, over the last 16 months in Human Services, we have turned 238 Medicare offices into family assistance offices as well. In the 16 months since we introduced this initiative, 350,000 Australian families have accessed family services through Medicare offices. I might add that in the electorate of Hasluck, for example, there are two Centrelink offices -  - in Gosnells and Midland, which are servicing 20,000 Centrelink customers in the electorate. The Medicare office in Midland shopping centre is servicing 168,000 customer visits a year. Now that Medicare office is distributing family payments to the benefit of the people of Hasluck. This again proves, at $50,000 a minute, that the Howard government is the most family-friendly government in Australian political history.</DOC>

 - The government did not shelve the Podger report. Indeed, a number of the recommendations from Podger were in fact picked up: not all of them, and no government is obliged to pick up every recommendation given to it, no matter how eminent the public servant may be. Indeed, many of the reforms that have been instituted in the health system over the past couple of years have involved cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. But I am fascinated that the Leader of the Opposition continues to quote from that House of Representatives report. I understand that in evidence presented to the committee on 26 May by Associate Professor Deborah Green, the past president of the Australian Healthcare Association, which is a national body for the public health care sector, this is what she had to say. Coincidentally it echoes comments I have repeatedly made about Australia's health system. I think both sides of politics, especially at a state level, do our health system a great deal of damage by constantly denigrating it without acknowledging the fact that with all its flaws the Australian health system is better than any in the rest of the world. This is what Associate Professor Green had to say:... when we were talking about what is world class ... when we are overseas and get sick, where do we want to be? Almost without exception people want to come to Australia - to come home - So whilst I think we are actually very harsh on our own health service ... in fact, it stacks up against just about any health service in the world.The Leader of the Opposition would do the health service and those who work in it a great service by recognising that with all its faults it is infinitely superior to the health system of any comparable country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay, whose constituents have certainly benefited over the last 10½ years from a strong economy. There were some documents released this morning called the national accounts. Amongst many other things, the national accounts showed that real wages have now risen by 17.9 per cent. Can I say that again, Mr Speaker: by 17.9 per cent since 1996, compared to a reduction of 1.7 per cent in real terms when Labor was last in government. In addition, there are nearly two million additional extra jobs since 1996. All of these results are good news for Australian families. Of course, there was introduction of Work Choices, which includes as a key element the introduction of Australian workplace agreements. Incidentally, in November the number of new workplace agreements signed was a record, at 33,927, and in the seven months that have gone by since Work Choices came in 181,671 AWAs have been entered into. In a year's time there will be almost one million Australian workplace agreements. Yet this morning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has indicated in an interview in the West Australian newspaper that the opposition will stick with the union demanded promise of abolishing AWAs if it is elected.In other words, one million Australian families are going to have their working lives thrown into chaos by the decision of a Labor government, if it were elected, to abolish AWAs. This will hurt Australian families. It will not only hurt Australian families; it will hurt the industries of Western Australia. The mining industry of Western Australia dreads the idea of AWAs being abolished because AWAs lie at the heart of the success, the prosperity and the progress of the mining industry of Western Australia. We are constantly told by the current spokesman on industrial relations, the member for Perth, that all our economic prosperity comes out of the mining industry. That is not correct, but I certainly acknowledge that the mining industry has been a very important part of it. So far from AWAs being bad news for families, they provide families with higher incomes, the flexibility of working from home, the flexible use of annual leave and sick leave, job sharing, and flexible start and finish times. Yet because the unions want it, the Labor Party would sweep all of this away and throw the working lives of a million Australians into chaos.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. It is true that the national accounts showed growth for the year to the September quarter of 2.2 per cent. It largely - not entirely - reflected a decline in farm production of 10 per cent. That is due to something that we all abhor and that is the drought. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition has an answer to that which has escaped the rest of his 20 million fellow Australians. We have 10 per cent being taken out of farm production so that farm GDP is 11.4 per cent lower over the year. There is a feature article accompanying the national accounts, and the ABS suggests that the drought will directly subtract about half of one percentage point from overall growth in 2006-07. That is a matter of very great concern, particularly to those farmers around Australia, which this side of the House proudly represents, who are grappling with the drought. The economy in September was badly affected by the drought.In relation to growth and economic achievement, nothing that the Leader of the Opposition draws comfort from in these accounts - what he apparently thinks is comfort is largely caused by the impact of the drought - alters the fact that we have now had 16 years of continuous economic growth and we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. The problem is not finding jobs for people who want them; increasingly, it is finding the workers for the jobs that are vacant. That is the dilemma of the modern economy which has been created by the economic policies of this government. It is a terrible dilemma. - Yes, it is all my own work - thank you. The fact that we have a 30-year low in unemployment is my own work and I am proud of my work. I am proud of the fact that we have a 30-year low in unemployment. I am also proud of the fact that the successive reforms of this government in taxation and industrial relations, in particular, have laid the groundwork for future prosperity. We do want a long-term growth economy and that is why we are in favour of industrial relations reform. The fact that Labor oppose it means they do not believe in long-term growth for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. The member for Gilmore knows from first-hand experience what our government has had to do over the last 10 years to ensure that the appropriate level of investment is made into infrastructure across regional Australia, whether it be the responsibility of the federal government, state governments or local governments. I instance the allocation of funding to Main Road 92 in the member's electorate. She fought hard to get funding for that road, which is, incidentally, a state road - one that is fundamentally the responsibility of the New South Wales government.Just remember that the AusLink program that we now have in place, which is being funded to the tune of $15 billion, is one that expects a certain level of cooperation and commitment from all levels of government. We have seen too often over the years an abrogation of responsibility by state governments. It is a stark reality. For example, we have the New South Wales government at the moment using the excuse of the lead-up to their state election to decide whether they should put some priority planning towards the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane. Guess what? This government, the Howard government, did it 10 years ago when we recognised it as a road of national importance. The New South Wales government are only just catching up now. It is the same category that we put Main Road 92 into a number of years ago.The point is that in the national interest all levels of government must make appropriate levels of investment in their areas of responsibility. There are other examples. Since 1999 the federal government has had money available to upgrade Paddys Bridge on the Hume Highway. This is a bridge that is restricting the capacity of the road transport industry in efficiency gains and greater competitiveness. Only now, seven years later, is New South Wales moving on this upgrade. These are all facts - this is not a blame game; these are all facts. If we are going to point the finger at anybody we are going to ensure that all levels of government shoulder their responsibilities across Australia, whether it is investment in infrastructure, education or health.Another example is in Tasmania. The Bridgewater Bridge is a critical link between Hobart and the north of the island. Our government has had $100 million on the table for the last five years to upgrade this critical link in Tasmania. The Tasmanian government in the lead-up to the Tasmanian election tried to get that money transferred onto their state roads - their responsibility. And the people of Australia need to know this. They need to know what is going on at the state level. So if the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about a true partnership in the federal structure of this country, he should talk to his mates at a state level to ensure that they shoulder their fair share of the responsibilities in the provision of infrastructure, the investment in infrastructure and the services they are responsible for across Australia.</DOC>

 - No, it is not a good question because, firstly, I did not attribute all of the result to the drought. I made that very clear. But, significantly, if farm production is down by 10 per cent and if it is 11.4 per cent down over the year, it is a major factor. In relation to productivity, the fall in the quarter of 0.4 per cent is largely accounted for by the large employment growth of 1.2 per cent or 117,000 people in the September quarter. So I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition should read the accounts more closely.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Today's September quarter national accounts showed the Australian economy continuing to grow, and in the non-farm economy growing very solidly indeed - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - In the non-farm sector, GDP grew by 0.6 per cent, to be 2.6 per cent higher through the year. The national accounts feature article, 'Impact of drought on agricultural production', suggests that the drought will directly subtract around 0.5 per cent from overall economic growth in 2006-07. Let me say that that is direct subtraction. Of course, it is not just the fall in farm production that has an effect on the economy. Once farm production falls, transport to the rural economy, wholesaling from the rural economy and services to the rural economy also detract. The detraction will be greater than 0.5 per cent once you take into account indirect effects as well as the direct effects.To give you some idea of the effect of that, Mr Speaker, the ABS notes that production of wheat, barley and canola could fall by over 60 per cent, and agricultural income in the September quarter fell by 51.7 per cent. A 51.7 per cent fall in agricultural income is a very, very substantive fall indeed.Outside the rural sector, however, consumer demand was considered to be at a moderate and sustainable pace. There is evidence of some recovery in relation to the building sector. Production in the mining sector increased quite substantially. We saw a redirection of the economy from the domestic sector towards the export sector - a welcome reshift.Not only were incomes high - and the Prime Minister has already referred to the fact that the jump in incomes now means that the increase in real wages has been 17.9 per cent under this government - but corporate profits reached the highest share of GDP on record. That means we have a very, very profitable business sector in Australia which is supporting increased job creation - the strongest job creation we have seen in a generation. Indeed, in the last year, 245,000 new jobs were created in Australia. That means 245,000 of our fellow Australians are now in work as a consequence.In the national accounts, measures of inflation were around three per cent lower than the consumer price index. The consumer price index has been knocked around by one-off factors in recent quarters. We would expect those to unwind in the quarters to come. What we have here is a picture of an economy which is still growing strongly in the longest expansion that Australia has ever experienced, knocked around by a very significant drought which is affecting rural production, but made up for by other sectors of the economy which are continuing to keep the economy growing and jobs being created.</DOC>

 - If the Leader of the Opposition had followed carefully what I have been saying over the last few months about Work Choices, the point I have made is that over the last seven months, despite all the warnings made by the Labor Party, employment has continued to grow, wages have continued and, on top of that, strikes have been at a lower level - the lowest since 1913. Clearly, the benefits of Work Choices, as they flow through the economy, will lead to higher productivity in the years ahead.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his interest. The government strongly condemns the unlawful overthrow of a democratically elected government in Fiji. Yesterday was not just a tragic day for Fiji; it was also a tragic day for the Pacific. Commodore Bainimarama claims to have assumed executive power and he claims that he has dismissed the democratically elected Prime Minister and government.The fact is that the actions of Commodore Bainimarama are illegal and he should ultimately be held accountable for acting illegally in the way that he has done and those responsible for the coup should ultimately be punished for their actions. After all, let us not forget that Commodore Bainimarama claimed that those responsible for the coup in 2000 should be held accountable for their actions in conducting an illegal coup and breaking the law of Fiji. Commodore Bainimarama and his colleagues, likewise, should be held accountable and ultimately should be punished.One of the first symptoms of a dictatorship is to muzzle free speech, which is precisely what Commodore Bainimarama has done. The Fiji Times newspaper was effectively shut down yesterday when its editors quite rightly, quite appropriately and quite bravely refused to accept any intimidation by the military, who demanded that they should be able to censor that newspaper. We condemn in the strongest of terms the way that newspaper and the media generally are being treated in Fiji. We will certainly do what we can to encourage the restoration of freedom of speech, freedom of association and other fundamental freedoms in Fiji.This morning I called in the Fiji High Commissioner, who I know is deeply disturbed and distressed about what has happened to his beautiful country. I informed him that Australia was now introducing a series of sanctions against Fiji. We will impose travel bans to Australia on Fijian military personnel and their direct families. We will also ban from Australia members of any unconstitutional, illegal government that Commodore Bainimarama chooses to appoint. We have suspended now our defence cooperation program with Fiji and I believe that the Commonwealth will consider and probably accept a proposal to suspend Fiji from the Commonwealth at a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group at the end of this week. The coup has been deplored by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan; he said that he strongly deplored the coup.Let me just say in conclusion that the Prime Minister and I have spoken personally on a number of occasions in the last few days to Prime Minister Qarase. This is a man of very great courage. He has not bowed to the intimidation of the military. He has held his ground. He has shown a strong commitment to decency, to democracy and to the freedoms that the ordinary people of Fiji expect to be their own. We will stand by Prime Minister Qarase, his government and the Fijian parliament at this very difficult time.I have spoken to a number of other people during the course of the morning and - I am sure that all members of parliament would agree with this - I think the ordinary people of Fiji and the institutions of government in Fiji should show passive resistance to this imposition of a dictatorship on their country. I do not think public servants should cooperate with the commodore and the military. I do not think the police should cooperate with the commodore and the military. I think they should show passive resistance to this regime. Commodore Bainimarama should understand that there is an urgent need to restore the ownership of government in his country to the people of that country through their democratically elected parliament and institutions.</DOC>

 - I reject the proposition that because some people have been apparently imprisoned in error by the processes of a department it means the government is insensitive to family values. That is the equivalent of saying that anybody who suffers any kind of injury while in a state prison, incarcerated under the laws of the state, means that the state government is insensitive to the family values of the prisoner who has been injured. It is a ridiculous proposition.I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that we put in place a process in relation to the Ombudsman, and it is the Ombudsman's report which we commissioned from which he is quoting to ask me this question. In a large program dealing with illegal immigration, it is sadly the case that mistakes are made. No administration is perfect; there are mistakes made. This country, over the past few years, has had a problem with illegal immigration, either by people coming here illegally or overstaying their lawful permission to be in this country. It is because we have been willing to uphold the laws of this country and people have been taken into detention that inevitably mistakes have been made. But the alternative offered by the Australian Labor Party at various stages -  - It is significant that over the past few years - despite everything that has been said by the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues opposite - public support for, and belief in, the integrity of the Australian immigration system has risen. There is more support for a higher immigration program now than there was in this community when we came to office in 1996. The reason for that is that they now think there is a fair dinkum, strong immigration policy that is properly administered and properly run by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes. I can tell her that it is now seven months since the government announced the most far-reaching reform of superannuation in Australia's history. Former Labor minister Susan Ryan wrote:Costello's uncharacteristically bold and effective plan to simplify super and reduce its taxes should be commended.She went on to say:Maybe faced with the Treasurer's bold gazumping of Labor's cherished but slightly shabby super property, the Opposition will find the resolve to get another big picture worked out, and the wherewithal to let voters know about it.That was seven months ago, and endorsed by Susan Ryan. We have been waiting breathlessly to hear what the Labor Party thinks about it. -  - Even now we have the assistant shadow Treasurer - temporary - interjecting. We have the member for Brisbane interjecting. Somehow they cannot announce a policy until we introduce the legislation. That, I think, is the member for Hunter's view: the Labor Party cannot announce a position until they see the bill. - That is his position. Unfortunately for him it is not the position of Labor spokesmen, because yesterday they did announce their position. Apparently, the member for Hunter has not been let into the loop yet. Yesterday Senator Sherry put out a media release: 'Labor to support budget superannuation plan'. That was on Wednesday, 6 December. That is funny, the legislation has not been introduced. As we have observed from the member for Hunter, he could not announce a position until it was introduced. Some people will wonder why his position on the front bench is under threat! Others will know. In fact, the 'guess the shadow Treasurer' competition has moved into a new phase. The member for Lalor will not step up to the plate. The member for Melbourne -  - Of course, the member for Grayndler's time as shadow environment minister is coming to an end in favour of the member for Kingsford Smith. As someone said, 'Having the member for Grayndler instead of the member for Kingsford Smith is like having Barry Crocker in preference to Elvis Presley,' which I think is a bit tough on Barry.The shadow minister for superannuation, Senator Nick Sherry, has come out and said that Labor will now support the budget superannuation plan. The Labor caucus has decided to support the budget superannuation plan. Can I say that this is the first good decision that has been taken under the new Leader of the Opposition. It is seven months too late, but finally the Labor Party has brought itself around to support some decent reform in this place. Whilst the Labor Party are about it, let me announce some other decent reforms they could support in this place. - Why not change the policy on industrial relations? Why not get behind the government in relation to the Future Fund? Why not support us in relation to provisioning for future generations? Whilst the Leader of the Opposition is about changing some of those Labor policies, let me commend him to follow the coalition policy on all of the issues where Labor has opposed them in the past. The reforms that this government has put in place have got us to where we are now, and we need to take those reforms forward for a new generation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and for a very strong commitment to border protection and, in particular, the basing of Armidale class patrol boats at HMAS Cairns. There is arguably no more important responsibility for any government than the protection of a nation's borders and the sovereignty of its waters and its economic exclusion zone. In the recent budget this year, the government announced that an additional $388 million would be committed to border protection to detect and prevent illegal foreign fishing and unlawful arrivals and also to support the protection of our gas and oil platforms.In support of our Customs aircraft, our Customs vessels and fishing and management authority activities, the Royal Australian Navy is providing a single fast frigate for the cause. We currently have five Armidale class patrol boats, which will rise to seven. The government has put two more minehunters into border protection. We have an RAAF Orion surveillance aircraft supporting these operations. Also, the government has consolidated the management of this process in a single border protection command.There is no more important task that is done by the Royal Australian Navy than the protection of Australia's borders. In April this year, I had the privilege of spending a day and a night on HMAS Bathurst, up at the Top End. Apart from admiring the courage and dedication of our Navy personnel, it became clear that our people are taking increasing risks in protecting our borders. The foreign fishing vessels that are coming to our country are increasingly sophisticated. They are engaging in activities which are very dangerous to our personnel and indeed to our patrol boats, including using very large sharpened poles, the throwing of missiles and a variety of things which endanger our people. On one occasion late last year, on a boarding party from HMAS Geelong attempting to board one of these vessels that was ignoring orders from one of our patrol boats, one of our people was left hanging onto the stern of this vessel as it sought to escape.I asked the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Navy in May this year to review the rules of engagement under which the escalating measures that can be taken by our Navy could be strengthened somewhat. Yesterday, I approved new rules of engagement which, in addition to what our Navy can currently do, will include the use of capsicum spray. They will also include the use of tear gas, distraction explosives and firing. They will also include long-range acoustic explosives, and, under certain circumstances, our patrol boats will be allowed to fire directly to disable a vessel which is ignoring orders, which is seeking to escape apprehension and which indeed is threatening our Navy and our people. It is extremely important that anybody who comes to this country seeking to steal our fish and breach our sovereignty knows that they will be met with a very strong, disciplined Royal Australian Navy.I am asked about alternative policies. The Labor Party has had four different policies on this in five years - the so-called coastguard. When the parliamentary committee considered in 2001 the concept of a coastguard, the Royal Australian Navy said this: 'The creation of a coastguard would have a detrimental effect on Navy training and experience.' I might also add that the CFMEU journal, Common Cause, in November that year asserted that the coastguard would be manned by members of the Maritime Union.Australians have a very clear choice. They have very strong border protection, centrally coordinated, well resourced and supported by the Royal Australian Navy, where people coming to steal our fish and breach our sovereignty are met by a Royal Australian Navy ship. Alternatively, they can be met by a unionised coastguard which splinters and undermines the training of Navy personnel. - </DOC>

 - I can confirm that the report indicated a number of things, including some of those alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition. It also outlined some key achievements in environmental management since 2001, including a fourfold increase in Commonwealth government spending on the environment; decreases in land clearing in many states, which in turn have had a positive impact on Australia's biodiversity; advances in protection of the marine environment; generally good air quality in most capital cities; and, improved water management through the Commonwealth government's national water reform agenda. The report also outlines key environment challenges for Australia, including pressures on some of our fisheries and population pressure on the coast; the need for continued waste reduction and recycling efforts; and, the poor condition of inland waters and coastal lakes in some parts of Australia. In the last five years, contrary to what is implied in the Leader of the Opposition's question, the government has invested an unprecedented amount of funding in the environment - namely, $10.3 billion. That is an average additional payment of $2 billion a year.The response of the opposition is, 'That's of no account. What you have to do is sign up to the present Kyoto protocol.' The reasons we have not signed the current Kyoto protocol are manifold. One of them is that, even if everybody met their emission target, you would have a total of one per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. Another reason - particularly important to the interests of those Australian communities that depend on the resources sector, on the coal industry - is that if we had signed the Kyoto protocol in its current form it could have put Australian industry at a competitive disadvantage. The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to advocate that policy, but I am for the coalminers and the coal industry of this country. I am not going to have their great industry put at a competitive disadvantage. We need to do even more in relation to climate change. We need to invest even more heavily in clean coal technology. We also need to have an open-minded debate of ideas, including a debate on nuclear power.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. In answering, I note that the unemployment rate in his electorate of Stirling has fallen from 9.4 per cent when Labor was in government to just 5.4 per cent today. What that means for hundreds, if not thousands, of families in Stirling, in Perth, Western Australia, is that they have a job and are able to provide for their families in a way that was not possible under the high unemployment rates of the Labor Party.Today's national account confirms once again that the Howard government reforms are delivering higher wages for Australian employees. These figures show that real wages in Australia under this government have grown by 17.9 per cent. That compares with the 13 years of the previous Labor government in which the real wages for ordinary Australian workers went backwards. Since Work Choices was introduced we have seen over 180,000 new Australian workplace agreements lodged and we have also seen many union and non-union collective agreements. I can report to the House and to the member for Stirling that the majority of these agreements contain family-friendly provisions that suit both employer and employee. Let me give you a few examples of a couple of well-known employers in Australia. David Jones, for example, have introduced flexible rosters, the opportunity for employees to bank additional hours for paid leave and new paid business leave. Country Road, another major employer in Australia which employs many young people, have introduced family-friendly provisions - child-care leave, extended maternity leave and the option of leave on half pay.Small employers are also introducing family-friendly provisions. For example, the Salsa Bar and Grill in Port Douglas is providing their restaurant manager with shifts that accommodate her child-care arrangements. Increasingly, under agreement-making in Australia we see agreements containing family-friendly provisions that suit both the employer and the employee. This type of flexibility is what the Labor Party wants to roll back. They want to take us back to the old award system. For example, the New South Wales Paint and Varnish Makers Award is the type of thing which the Leader of the Opposition, under instruction from the union bosses, wants to take us back to. It does not even contain a part-time hours clause, yet we get this rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition about being family friendly.The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition is all rhetoric. This is a triumph of style over substance. And why will they not go to the substance? Because their substance is a one-size-fits-all that will not benefit Australian workers or Australian businesses. The reality is that Australian workers and Australian employers are voting with their feet. They are taking up agreements put in place under the legislation of this government, agreements which are family friendly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. As I indicated in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the report that was released today indicated a number of things, including some of the things referred to by both the member for Oxley and the Leader of the Opposition. It is true that this country faces significant environmental challenges. That is why it is absolutely fundamental that we have a proper debate with every idea and every response on the table, not a debate that ideologically rejects out of blind prejudice and ignorance consideration of one source of environmentally clean energy generation - namely, nuclear power. Anybody who understands anything about this debate would have to acknowledge, politics aside, that the way forward for this country, if we are to maintain our economic growth, is to have power generation based on cleaner use of coal and other clean environmentally friendly alternatives, and that has to include nuclear power. The member for Batman knows that, and I invite the member for Batman to talk to the member for Oxley and to educate him on some of the relevant issues. - You cannot look at the environmental challenges of this country through ideological blinkers, and that is essentially what the Australian Labor Party is doing. I am very proud of the things that this government has done for the environment. When I answered the question from the Leader of the Opposition I really did not do the government's performance justice. For example, I did not mention that in the last budget we had a historic additional investment of $500 million to restore the health of the Murray and I did not remind the House that we have spent over $2 billion in relation to measures designed inter alia to meet our Kyoto target of 108 per cent. I point out that we are one of the few OECD countries and the only non-nuclear OECD country which is currently on track. Let me say that again: we are one of the few OECD countries and the only non-nuclear OECD country currently on track to either meet or go very close to meeting our Kyoto target. Today, for example, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources announced $13 million for eight renewable energy projects under the government's renewable energy development initiative. - I am perfectly happy to sit down, Mr Speaker. - You have not? I am sitting down anyway. - What is your problem? I was being courteous: I sat down because you were on your feet. - I thought that was good manners, but if you would like me to continue to stand up all the time I am happy to do so. -  - Who did you warn, Mr Speaker? 
An opposition member - Swan, not you. - Swan - not me, I hope. I sometimes do not hear these things, Mr Speaker. Let me just remind the House that, amongst the many things that we have done, we have a commitment to low emissions technology that has been demonstrated through the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the $75 million Solar Cities program and the $100 million investment in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. We have already announced a large number of the allocations. We have announced three solar cities - Adelaide, Townsville and Blacktown - and they will install some 3,000 photovoltaic panels. They will assist more than 230,000 residents and businesses in learning how to reduce their energy use and to save money. They will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 64,000 tonnes each year and save their communities $9 million a year in electricity bills.We have made a massive investment in the water fund to the tune of $2 billion. A lot of that money has already been allocated, and the member for Wentworth is in discussion with the states about some of the larger projects that they have put forward. Water is the great environmental challenge that this country has, and we are examining those projects. I welcome the release of the State of the environment report because it has given me an opportunity, courtesy of questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Oxley, to tell the House and, through the House, the Australian people of the magnificent more than $10 billion program this government has had over the last five years. It is a figure that I do not think many Australians would be conscious of, but over the last five years we have invested $10.5 billion in environmental projects. I warmly thank the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Oxley for the opportunity to remind the Australian people of that achievement.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - You certainly did. I thank the honourable member for her question. It was a great pleasure for all of us to welcome here today the President of the Republic of Korea, President Roh, and also his Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Song. It has been a timely reminder of the close relationship that exists between our two countries. Let me make three points about this visit. First of all, it has been an excellent opportunity for us to discuss the issue of North Korea and to ensure that everything that could possibly be done is being done to enforce the sanctions on North Korea which were introduced by the Security Council. The Australian government has made the point that it is one thing to resume six-party talks - we are much in favour of that - but these talks have to achieve something. They cannot just be talks for the sake of talks. North Korea cannot be rewarded just for returning to talks.Secondly, it is an opportunity for us to talk about the environmental work done between Australia and Korea. The opposition asked questions about climate change. Australia and the Republic of Korea are founder members of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. Indeed, our two countries co-chair the Task Force on Renewable Energy. So here are two countries out there, addressing the issue of climate change in practical ways.Thirdly, in terms of the very strong economic relationship between our two countries, Australia and Korea have now agreed to undertake a feasibility study into a free trade agreement between our two countries. We hope that feasibility study will be constructive and will in the end lead to the negotiation of a free trade agreement. So it is a visit that is extremely welcome and a relationship that is very strong.</DOC>

 - I am aware that some of the wetlands are threatened - I think it might have something to do with the drought. Forgive me for saying that - that is blaming somebody, is it, animating nature? That is apparently the 'blame game', Mr Speaker. Let me also say this to the member for Melbourne Ports - a member on the other side whom I respect a great deal: I don't think signing the Kyoto protocol is going to do anything to save Australian wetlands. While I was on my feet a few moments ago, answering another question about -  - the report that was referred to by the member for Melbourne Ports, the State of the environment report, I kept referring to $10.5 billion of additional expenditure over the last five years. As I sat down, it had a strange resonance. - It had a very strange resonance. It only came to me courtesy, I have to acknowledge, of one of my colleagues, whose sharpness on this I greatly respect - namely, the member for Casey. That figure, the $10.5 billion, was the budget deficit that this government inherited from the former Labor government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I am pleased that he acknowledges that we have a world-class health system. He is not alone. No lesser authorities than the Prime Minister and every state and territory Labor chief minister acknowledge that Australia has 'one of the best health systems in the world'. That does not mean that it is perfect, but it does mean that would-be reformers have to be careful lest they end up throwing out the baby with the bathwater. - Everyone would like to end the blame game over public hospitals, but the task of political leadership is not to devise a wish list but to explain how real improvements can be made. As far as this government is concerned, the way to end the blame game is for the federal government to run well the programs for which it is responsible, for the states to run public hospitals better and for both levels of government to manage the boundaries between their respective programs. - What you don't do if you want to end the blame game is set up a new federal-state quango, a single funder, to run public hospitals which will mean that no-one is really in charge. I say to the new Leader of the Opposition that if he thinks that the states are mismanaging our public hospitals he should say so. If he thinks that he can better manage waiting lists, if he thinks that he can better control costs, he should tell us how. One thing he certainly should not do is seek advice from the member for Lalor. Even after five years as shadow health minister the best she could come up with was to say in her Earl Page lecture: 'Anyone who has already made up their mind -  - about what governments should do in this area -  - hasn't thought through all the difficult issues.' - No wonder she doesn't get any questions in this House. She can't make up her mind what to do and, if she could, she wouldn't have thought through all the difficult issues. - No wonder she thinks she is not up to being shadow Treasurer. And she is not up to being shadow Treasurer. On behalf of the Australian people, I have a simple request of the new Leader of the Opposition: show us the policies! The Australian people are not interested in who runs hospitals; they want hospitals to run better. If the Leader of the Opposition cannot show us the policies, people will quickly conclude that Labor made a big mistake when they so cruelly dumped Kim Beazley.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the overnight testimony by Mr Gates. I do understand from later news reports, particularly Reuters, that he subsequently somewhat qualified -  -  - He did! But I am very happy to very directly answer the question asked by the member. The objective of this government and the objective of other members of the coalition must be to create a situation in that country such that the Iraqi people, having bravely voted on three occasions to embrace democracy, are able to look after themselves. That is the objective, and that will not be achieved by following the policy of the Australian Labor Party. Our objective is an Iraq that is able to defend herself -  - The strategy leading to the objective, whatever description the member for Cowan wants to give it, of this government -  -  - is to create a situation whereby the people of Iraq, having bravely voted in the most appalling circumstances - including the most appalling intimidation - to embrace democracy, can live, protected by their own military and their own police force. That is the aim. That is the government's policy. I repeat: it will not be achieved by the precipitate withdrawal of coalition forces, which is the policy of the Australian Labor Party.The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - The effect of the policy advocated by the Australian Labor Party is that the coalition would withdraw before the Iraqis are able to protect the democracy they have voted to embrace in the most -  - If the coalition withdraws from Iraq in the way the Labor Party wants it to, then Iraq will be condemned to endless additional violence. Not only will it be regarded as an enormous victory for terrorism in Iraq but it will destabilise the politics of the Middle East. It will further set back the prospects of a settlement of the Palestinian issue, which is the core of many moderate Islamic concerns not only in the Middle East but around the world. That is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. - I do take responsibility for the decisions of this government on Iraq. I have never run away from my responsibilities. I have always accepted total responsibility. What the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party do not like is to be reminded of the inevitable consequences of their strategy and their policy. They may not like it but, if Labor's policy were followed, we would condemn the coalition to a significant strategic defeat in Iraq -  - I was asked a question on government policy in Iraq. - Our policy is not to withdraw coalition forces in circumstances of defeat - that is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. I want to remind everybody who sits opposite that if the United States withdraws from Iraq, which they are effectively advocating, in circumstances of defeat, not only will that do enormous damage to American prestige in the Middle East and around the world, with great adverse consequences for Australia, but also it will create a great deal of additional instability -  - in Iraq and in many other countries in the Middle East. It will set back the cause of trying to settle the long-running Palestinian issue which, as everybody who has studied this matter knows, is at the heart of many of the discontents in the Middle East. I am against a policy that gives a victory to the terrorists. I am against a policy that creates further instability in the Middle East and I am against a policy that leads to damage being done to the prestige of our most important ally, the United States. I take full responsibility for being opposed to those policies and I take full responsibility for the policy advocated and implemented by the government I lead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for his second question on this topic this week. He is clearly a man who is dedicated to his electorate and to providing for families. Yesterday I outlined the wonderful support that the Howard government has provided to Australian families -  - regardless of where they live in this country over recent years. I acknowledge the Red Cross representatives here today in the gallery and the fine work that they do. There are a number of programs that the Howard government has implemented to help families - quite often families that are struggling. These are programs like Communities for Children, Early Childhood - Invest to Grow and the Raising Children website. That website is a wonderful tool for all parents to be able to get in and see good, practical information about raising their children and overcoming some of the difficulties that those of us in this place who are parents experience and, of course, it provides local answers.The Communities for Children program is run right around the country in electorates like that of the member for Macarthur; in the electorate of the Opposition Whip, the member for Chifley, in Blacktown; in the electorate of the member for Paterson and in areas like Fairfield. It is run by wonderful organisations such as Mission Australia and the Smith Family amongst others. I visited the electorate of the member for Kingston a few months back and spoke to fathers. They spoke very passionately to me about the relationships that they rebuilt as a result of the connection of local organisations being supported by the Howard government's initiatives in the Communities for Children program. It is essential that we as a government give as much support as we can to children in their early years from birth to five. Not every parent has the skills that are needed to be able to provide the life experience and the upbringing that is going to ensure that their children will be well-equipped in life. It is these wonderful organisations that we partner with that assist these people to have a better future.Could I just suggest to the Leader of the Opposition, as he runs his show over the next 24 hours and puts together a team, the importance of families. I reflect on the seismic shift that occurred three years ago within the Labor Party - it is similar to the one that occurred two days ago - and remind him of the brains trust that put together their families and taxation policy that was going to take money from these very families we have referred to today. In that brains trust that wanted to strip money from families were people like the member for Lilley, who I recall thought that was not real money; the member for Fraser, who may make a comeback - he was then the shadow finance minister; the member for Gellibrand, of course, who was then looking after the shadow ministry for women; and the now deputy leader, the member for Lalor. I would hope, as you look towards running your show and you find someone who is able to look after the interests of families on behalf of the opposition, that you take into account those who were ready to stand by a Labor policy to harm Australian families the last time Labor had a leadership change.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, my assertion is that we are not playing the blame game. We seem to have had a new mantra in Australian politics in the last week, and that is: you are never allowed to say anything critical of state government because they are all Labor; it is perfectly in order to criticise the federal government. However, if the Leader of the Opposition does not believe me when I say that the Commonwealth and the states are cooperating appropriately, he might believe the person who said the following thing on 14 July 2006:Prime Minister I think it's fair to say that the meeting today, and even indeed the informal discussions at The Lodge last night, show cooperative federalism in action. And I agree with my colleague from Victoria, those who seek to denigrate this relationship don't understand it. Cooperative federalism is producing results for Australia, and indeed this relationship between the States and the Commonwealth is probably the best in Australia's history ...Those were the words of Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland -  -  - Yes, I worked with him. He is not a bad bloke to work with. Our politics may be different, but when the interests of Australians living in Queensland are involved he and I can work together in a very cooperative fashion. This is what he had to say:On other issues, in terms of health, I'm absolutely delighted with the Prime Minister's offer to the States to provide additional doctors. It means an additional 150 training places in Queensland and I won't go through the nurses and allied health professionals, but that is a significant advance for skilling Australians to actually look after Australians.But he got even more lyrical as the press conference wore on:... we have cooperative federalism, we put party politics aside and work in the interest of Australia. For those who seek to undermine it, I just simply say look at the outcomes today and anyone with half a brain will fully support it.Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: have half a brain; stop undermining this cooperative federalism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for that question. It goes to something which is of very great concern to me and to Australians living in Victoria. I think we are aware that the situation in Victoria is very serious indeed, with up to 37 fires burning in north-east Victoria and Gippsland, and up to 50 in Victoria more generally. Earlier today I rang the Victorian Premier, Mr Bracks, and offered any additional Commonwealth assistance that Victoria might stand in need of. He has indicated that he will be writing to me today in relation to some additional assistance from the Australian Defence Force.I am advised that the Attorney-General has approved a request by the Victorian government for assistance in controlling the Victorian bushfires, and this consists of a fuel tanker and a crew to supply diesel to water tankers and machinery such as bulldozers in the Mansfield-Whitfield region. Earlier, in my absence, the Acting Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Victoria, assuring him that the Australian government is ready to provide any assistance which Victoria might stand in need of.These bushfires are very serious indeed, and I understand the anxiety of the member for Indi and other members in this place representing those parts of Victoria where the fires are burning fiercely. I want the people of Victoria to know that the Commonwealth will stand side-by-side with the government of Victoria. We will provide any additional assistance that the Premier needs, and the two of us will continue to be in close and cooperative contact to make certain that the right response is given to help the people of Victoria.</DOC>

 - I do not know whether I have misunderstood the question, but I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me why we would not spend any of this money to buy back water. I thought we had issued a tender -  
A government member - Yes, we have. - We had. I thought in fact we had done the very thing you had asked us to do. I might also tell the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that in the last budget, after I had made that statement, we put another $500 million into the Murray-Darling Basin. The reality is that this government has provided more money to solve the problem of the Murray-Darling Basin than we ever agreed to do in discussion with the states. The original arrangement was that we would put a couple of hundred million dollars in and the states between them would put $300 million in, but the Treasurer announced in the budget of May of this year that over and above that we would put another $500 million in. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the member for Wentworth, announced the tender to buy back the water some weeks ago. I suggest the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do a bit of research.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for asking me a question about industrial disputes on a day on which the families of Australia, via the latest employment figures, have been given a wonderful Christmas present. I can say, as I lead into the answer, that we have maintained our 30-year low in unemployment and that almost 200,000 jobs have been created since the introduction of Work Choices. I can tell the member for Casey that today's ABS data on industrial disputes reports the lowest results ever recorded of industrial disputation in this nation. In the September quarter the ABS recorded industrial disputes at 2.3 working days lost per thousand employees. The June quarter, which had also been a record low, was recorded at 3.2 working days lost per thousand. This compares to the last full quarter under the opposition's system of 43 working days lost per thousand employees - 43 versus 2.3. That is a 92 per cent reduction in industrial disputes since Labor and the unions' system of industrial relations was changed by Peter Reith and this government in 1996. Labor's record dispute quarter came in December 1992. Despite the anaemic state of the labour market and the still very high level of unemployment in 1992, the figure was 104.6 working days lost per thousand employees.But if you drill down you find that the most interesting figure was the absolutely stunning result in the building and construction sector, a sector which an earlier Cole royal commission found to be plagued by thuggery and intimidation. The House will be fascinated with these figures. The industrial dispute figure for the building industry in the September quarter of 2005 - that was the last quarter prior to the introduction of the building industry laws - was 37.4 working days lost per thousand employees. That was September of last year, before the new laws in the construction industry came into effect. Today's release for September of this year showed only 1.6 working days lost per thousand employees in the building and construction industry.So in a year, as a result of our reforms, which the Labor Party fought every inch of the way, we have gone in the building and construction industry from 37.4 working days lost per thousand to 1.6. That is a stunning result and it is a direct consequence of the laws we changed. We have not only decimated the number of industrial disputes but reduced the cost of building and construction. I say to the opposition that, in light of all of this, it is economic lunacy to propose rolling back those laws, yet the unions tell you you must and you will, just as it is economic lunacy to propose rolling back the Work Choices laws which so far in seven months have seen almost 200,000 more Australians put in work and 200,000 happier Australian families this Christmas.</DOC>

 - That is not what I said. The Leader of the Opposition is trickily slipping into misrepresentation. What I did say yesterday was that the drought had obviously had an impact on wetlands. I was asked a question about wetlands by somebody up there. I think it may have been the member for Melbourne Ports. He is nodding his head. I remember his question well. And I was asked a question about the national accounts. Obviously the drought has had an impact, but, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to get into a comparison of economic performance over the last 10½ years, bring it on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Today we had the release of the labour force figures for the month of November. Those figures showed that in the month of November, the month just gone by, in Australia there were 57,400 new full-time jobs created. That is extraordinary jobs creation. After allowing for a fall in part-time employment, overall employment increased by 36,200 persons. If we go back over the nine months or so since Work Choices, there have been 200,000 new jobs created in Australia. If we go back to -  - The member for Bendigo asked, 'How many of these were created by the state governments?' Talk about the blame game. I thought you were against trading off the federal and the states? Oh, sorry, you would have voted for Kevin Rudd. I am sorry. You were not part of it. If we go back over 2006, we have had 250,000 new jobs created in Australia - a quarter of a million. I want the House to think back to the crowd at the MCG protesting about Work Choices. There were 40,000 people there. Imagine that 40,000 people in the MCG and now imagine six times that number, because six times that number is the number of people that have found work in the last year. Over the course of the 10 years of this government, there have now been 1.95 million new jobs created.Seeing as the Labor Party are so concerned about the blame game, they would have been terribly concerned about an article in today's Daily Telegraph written by Michael Costa. It says, 'Costello's inflated policies hurting NSW'. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition will be straight on to him and say, 'Mr Costa, we don't play the blame game in the Labor Party.' We have 1.95 million new jobs and 10 years of economic growth, we survived the Asian financial crisis, we survived the tech wreck, we survived the US recession -  - We survived the one-in-100-year drought. - I know you are auditioning for shadow Treasurer. And you have one thing going for you - you are not a female. Females are not doing too well in this shadow ministry. Look at all of the suits, Mr Speaker. I think it was the member for Throsby who complained - The member for Bruce then left the chamber. - The New South Wales Treasurer came out with this little gem yesterday. He called on the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, to prevent the Reserve Bank from increasing interest rates. He said, 'The federal government has the power to intervene against the RBA and, as I have said on many occasions, he ought to exercise that power.' I called this one of the great feats of economic ignorance - saying that the federal Treasurer, the federal government, ought to undermine the integrity and independence of the Reserve Bank, which has been one of the cornerstones of Australia's economic policy over the last 10 years. There you have the New South Wales Labor Treasurer, who does not support the independence of the central bank, who has called for federal government intervention and who does not understand how monetary policy is conducted in this country. The Labor Party never supported the independence of the Reserve Bank when they were in office. It was one of the great economic reforms that we put in place in 1996. We will not be moving off it. We will not be giving in and surrendering that important plank of economic policy. It ill behoves anybody in the Labor Party to be arguing to the contrary.</DOC>

 - It is true that under the Fraser government the Reserve Bank did not have the independence it has now. That is right, and I think that was a bad policy. That is why when the present government came to power we changed it. But the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten about the Treasurer and later Prime Minister who was interspersed between the Fraser government and the Howard government, and that was a bloke called Paul John Keating. When he was asked about the independence of the Reserve Bank he said: 'Oh, don't worry. I've got the Reserve Bank in my pocket.' - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. Obviously the drought that is affecting so many parts of regional Australia is having a severe effect on many of those farming communities and the broader community. Of course, fundamental to that is the way that we manage our water resources in Australia. As the member for Mallee knows, the Constitution places responsibility for water planning and provision with the state governments. But, as has been indicated on many occasions in here as well as today, the federal government is shouldering a fair share of the responsibility in this regard. Thanks to a lot of the hard work that was done by the member for Mallee and in particular the member for Gwydir, the Australian government has taken a leadership role in putting together the National Water Initiative.We have had $2 billion worth of programs under the National Water Initiative, and the area the member for Mallee represents is, of course, one of the early recipients of one of those programs: the $167 million that we allocated towards the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline. That is a pipeline not for irrigation water but for stock and domestic water in the Wimmera-Mallee area in Victoria, where they are in the grip of a severe drought. When that work is completed - and it has started - it will save 83,000 megalitres of water every year. Every year, 83,000 megalitres of water will be saved because of the investment that has been made in the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline. It provided those communities with certainty to plan for the future. This is the critical issue that farmers and particularly irrigators require, particularly from the state governments, who manage the water systems. They need certainty and accurate information so that they can plan.In New South Wales the state government has taken a couple of decisions that have made it very difficult under extreme circumstances for irrigators in New South Wales to plan. It cut New South Wales irrigators' carry-over water entitlements. Carry-over water entitlements are one of the highest security water products available in New South Wales. Initially the government said to irrigators: 'We're going to cut them by 20 per cent. We are going to cut your carry-over entitlement by 20 per cent.' So managing their businesses, irrigators went out and planted their crops on the basis of the information made available. Then after they had invested in planting the crops, the New South Wales government said, 'No, we are going to cut them by a further 32 per cent.' So the sunk cost of planting the crop has been lost, and it has exacerbated the impact of drought with those irrigators in New South Wales. They are not just asking for more water; they are asking for better information and better planning of the water system.We continue to hear in the debate about the impact of drought about what irrigators are doing and that they are irresponsible people. There is an interesting statistic out, and that is that rice growers have improved their water efficiency by 80 per cent. They have improved their use of water by 80 per cent with new technology. The same question could be asked of many of the state government utilities who use water: whether they can improve their water efficiency by 80 per cent.It is important, in looking at this issue and this problem of better management of our water resources, that everybody shoulders their fair share of the responsibilities - our level of government, state governments and certainly industry. It is about getting timely and accurate information so proper business decisions can be made. Better management of our water resources is certainly in the interests of regional Australia, and better water management across the nation is certainly going to be vital for the future of our nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I welcome the publication of the report of the Baker-Hamilton commission in relation to Iraq. The contents of that report are largely to be said to be predictable. It certainly said words to the effect of those said by the Leader of the Opposition. But it also said a number of other things. For example, it said the following:... we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support.Can I say that again:A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.They are not my words or Alexander Downer's words. They are the words of James Baker and Lee Hamilton, from a bipartisan commission of inquiry.Of course the United States is looking at reworking its tactics but, as I have said before and I will say again -  - The words I have used in the past are very close to the words used by the Baker-Hamilton inquiry, 'a precipitate American withdrawal' - and that is Labor policy; the Leader of the Opposition leads a party which is advocating a policy that would produce, in the words of the very report referred to by the Leader of the Opposition -  - ... a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy.It would produce a situation where:Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory.Yet that is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party cannot have it both ways: they cannot require immediate Australian withdrawal without morally acknowledging that if it is good enough for Australia to pull out it is good enough for the United States and the United Kingdom to pull out. The Leader of the Opposition is chained to a policy that would have the disastrous consequences outlined by the bipartisan report to which he has just referred.</DOC>

 - First of all, as the Prime Minister has just said, we have been reading with a great deal of interest the work of the Iraq Study Group. They produced -  - a 100-odd page report. We welcome the work of the Iraq Study Group. It is one of a number of reviews that have been undertaken. What is interesting about this issue is that the Iraq Study Group agrees with the goal articulated by the United States administration, by the British government and by other coalition partners, of which there are 27 including Australia. The goal in Iraq is 'an Iraq that can govern, sustain and defend itself'. That is an entirely sensible and obvious, I would have thought, goal.The Baker-Hamilton report makes 79 different proposals. They are all worth looking at seriously. I will identify one of those proposals, and that is that there should be increasing diplomacy with Iran and Syria. I can say that the Australian government has taken the view all along that it is important we maintain dialogue with Iran on a lot of issues but importantly on this issue. Indeed, just last week I spent half an hour on the telephone with the Iranian foreign minister, most of the time - not all of the time - discussing the issue of Iraq. Whilst the Australian government is much in favour of further diplomacy with Iran and Syria, it has to be said that our hopes are not high for what that can achieve. Nevertheless, we see it as a useful initiative but one that you would have to be heroically optimistic to believe is likely to achieve a significant change.Next week the defence minister and I will be in Washington for the annual AUSMIN talks with our American counterparts. This will be an opportunity for us to further discuss, amongst other issues of course, the question of Iraq. As difficult as the situation is in Iraq, and especially in and around the Baghdad area, it is important to succeed in Iraq. It is also important to do something else, and that is to take into account the wishes of the Iraqi people. Some people set themselves up as greater judges than the Iraqi people. There are two things that the Iraqi people want. One of the things they want is to be rid of Saddam Hussein, and we helped them get rid of Saddam Hussein, and they do not want him back. The second thing they want is the international presence in Iraq for as long as necessary. Their own domestic security forces, particularly their army, are unable to handle security effectively enough themselves. It was never the object of the coalition to colonise Iraq; it was always the object of the coalition to set up a situation in Iraq where a democratic government would be able to sustain itself.The Iraq Study Group of course reinforces these very arguments. I know the Prime Minister has mentioned this already but it is worth repeating: the Iraq Study Group, which the Americans would say is a 'cross-aisle' group, includes Democrats and Republicans. A lot of people said that the election of a Democrat majority in the American Congress would mean the United States would just quit Iraq. This cross-aisle study group, this bipartisan study group, say that there were some ideas that the group explicitly rejected. They said that they did not 'recommend a precipitous withdrawal of troops because that might not only cause a bloodbath, it would also invite a wider regional war'. They are the words of Democrats and Republicans. They are the words, if I may say so, of people who have studied this issue in even greater detail than the Australian opposition.When we are asked if there are alternative policies in a difficult situation, our answer is that there is the Leader of the Opposition's policy, which is to haul up the white flag and surrender, and there is the Australian government's policy which is not to surrender but to stand by the people of Iraq for as long as they want us to do so to ensure that a democratic government in Iraq which has successfully been elected is able to survive in the teeth of insurgents and terrorists.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released its demographic statistics for the June quarter 2006, which showed that in the year to June 2006 264,287 births were registered - a 3.3 per cent increase over the year before, and the highest number of births since 1971-72. That is the highest number of births in over 30 years. In addition, the total fertility rate, which is the number of live births per female over their reproductive life, rose from 1.78 to 1.83 - the highest fertility rate in 11 years.It is something to be welcomed by all Australians that the number of births has increased, and the fertility rate, which had been falling continuously since 1961, has actually bottomed and turned. We would be one of the few countries in the industrialised world -  - which has actually had an increase in their fertility rate. I would encourage all Australians, as I have previously, to have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country, because it is a great response to -  - the way in which the fertility rate has been declining. As we have focused Australians' attention on the importance of the fertility rate, as we have focused Australians' attention on the challenges of the ageing of the population, many people have changed their attitudes towards having a family, and I think that is a good thing. We should not overstate these changes. The replacement fertility rate is 2.1, so we are still substantially below that replacement rate. But unlike Europe, Japan and many other industrialised countries, ours is ticking up and not ticking down.I also believe that the government's policies in relation to families have been very important. I refer to the provision of extra childcare places, the introduction of the childcare rebate, the introduction of the maternity payment or baby bonus, and of course the increases in the rates of family benefits. Let me remind members of the House of this: every year, a payment of $600 per child per annum is received by the families of Australia. If you have two kids, it is $1,200; for three kids, it is $1,800 - in a lump sum. Let me remind the House of one other thing: that is real money. It goes into the bank account; it comes out of the bank account. It can be used in exchange for goods and services. It is real money. You can even take it in cash.We know that there were suggestions from the Labor Party, from another one of the frontbenchers auditioning to be shadow treasurer at the moment, the member for Lilley, that this money did not exist. The families of Australia know differently. They get it per child per annum - real money to help them with the costs of raising children in this society.</DOC>

 - It is a bit rich for somebody who is in favour of it not working asking such a question. I have indicated on numerous occasions that I wish the operations were going differently. I have said repeatedly that there is a case for reworking some of the tactics. But the fundamental position of the government is starkly different. What the opposition wants is a course of action in Iraq which would produce the very bloodbath and descent into further disaster to which the Baker commission drew attention. What the Leader of the Opposition must face - The member for Cowan then left the chamber. - In the past few days the Leader of the Opposition has been talking a great deal about the need to articulate policies, the need to be positive, the need not to nitpick or to engage in a thing that he has loosely called the blame game. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that what he is required to do is to accept the inevitable consequences of the policy that he is advocating in relation to Iraq. The inevitable consequence of that policy was lucidly set out by James Baker and Lee Hamilton in their report, and it is all negative so far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Macquarie for his question and I appreciate that he is asking it on behalf of the 57,000 people in his electorate who benefit from the choice and security that private health insurance brings. Let me make it very clear that support for private health insurance is one of the signature policies of the Howard government. Thanks in large measure to the private health insurance rebate, the number of Australians covered by private health insurance has risen from six million to nine million, including more than one million Australians earning less than $20,000 a year. I can inform the House that in the September quarter an additional 82,000 people took out private health insurance. This is the fifth successive quarterly increase in private health insurance numbers, and in the last quarter that included 29,000 people aged under 25. These people can only afford private health insurance because of the Howard government's private health insurance rebate, because without that rebate the average family's premiums would increase by a thousand dollars a year.We still do not know who the next shadow minister for health will be, but we do know that every single one of the frontbenchers opposite hates the private health insurance rebate and wants to rip the guts out of private health insurance. -  - Oh, yes! Listen to their words, Mr Speaker. We have the member for Jagajaga, the current failed shadow minister for education, who described the private health insurance rebate -  - as 'the worst piece of public policy in Australian history'. We have the member for Perth, the current failed workplace relations shadow minister, who called the private health insurance rebate a 'public policy crime' and canvassed its abolition. We have the would-be shadow Treasurer, the member for Melbourne, who called it 'one of the least efficient programs of all time'. And then of course we have the member for Lalor, the person who does not think she is up to being the shadow Treasurer, who invented Medicare Gold to try to destroy the private health insurance system. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: drop the blame game that you have been playing all week and show me your policies. Show me the policies! In particular, say where you stand on the private health insurance rebate which means so much to so many Australian families.</DOC>

 - It is in the nature of Australian politics, as it should be, that the head of government ultimately is accountable for the overall performance of the government. I have never sought to evade that responsibility. What is more, on three occasions since the initial election in March 1996, which was in part at least a judgement on the performance of the former government, the Australian people have made a judgement. And when the election is next held they will have an opportunity to make a judgement about this government and also about the performance of the alternative government.I did not have the opportunity of seeing Senator Vanstone on The 7.30 Report but I am told that her performance took its customary feisty style. I want to say that I greatly respect the doggedness, the sagacity and the energy of Senator Vanstone. But you have asked me a question really about the Ombudsman's report, because what triggered all of this was the report of the Ombudsman, Professor McMillan. I am rather glad the member for Swan has asked me this because later in the evening, after I had the opportunity of having a bit of social discourse with my colleagues on the government front bench, I was still perfectly able and ready to watch Lateline. It is my wont to watch Lateline quite a bit. I often see my colleagues on Lateline and they perform very well; the foreign minister, for example, is a regular appearer on Lateline.There was one very, very interesting comment that was made by Professor McMillan when he was interviewed, and it rather blows out of the water everything that the opposition has been saying about the government in relation to this matter. He had this to say:There was no evidence in the cases that I've examined of any political pressure that led to deficient decisions.Here is the independent man, the person appointed as the keeper of the public interest. And bear in mind that all of these cases were referred to him by the minister, arising out of the Palmer inquiry. We send them all off to the Ombudsman, he has a look at them and he says, contrary to what the opposition -  - Professor McMillan was asked by Senator Vanstone, the woman whose reputation and performance you have tried to traduce - that is what you have tried to do - and he makes the cardinal central point:There was no evidence in any of the cases that I've examined of any political pressure that led to deficient decisions.In other words, on the whole argument the Leader of the Opposition and others have been running these past days, and that is that it was the rotten political policy of the government that produced all of these things, he said: not right.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. In answering it, I note that the latest unemployment figures show that the unemployment rate in the electorate of Hasluck has fallen from 7.4 per cent, when this government was first elected in 1996, to just 3.8 per cent. Indeed, in the labour market figures that were released today, we saw that in the month of November alone there were 8,400 extra jobs created in the state of Western Australia. Some of those jobs were for people who work in the company Perth Regional Roof Trusses, which won the Prime Minister's Small Business Award last night - some of its representatives that I know are in the gallery here today. I had the pleasure of visiting, with the member for Hasluck, that company just a couple of weeks ago. Perth Regional Roof Trusses is a very significant company because most of its employees are hearing impaired and I think it is a great credit to that company that they provide employment for those people.The Leader of the Opposition says that he supports the aspirations of Australian families, yet what we see from the opposition and its leader is opposition to the very policies that actually lead to the prosperity of Australian families. There are over one million independent contractors in Australia today. This parliament gave them further protection and, indeed, recognition with the passage of the Independent Contractors Bill 2006 just this past week. That bill provides legislative protection for those Australians who want to be their own boss - that great Australian aspiration of getting out, having a go, starting a business, building a business and being able to be your own boss. These new laws protect the freedom of those people to get on with running their own businesses, without unwarranted union interference and without the prescriptive controls of state industrial relations systems.I was interested to listen to some of the musings of the Leader of the Opposition this week and there was one in particular which caught my ear. He said:... I am constantly impressed by the entrepreneurialism of our small business sector and our independent contractors who are out there doing interesting and innovative and creative things.He obviously was not so 'constantly impressed' to actually vote for this legislation in the parliament to support those very independent contractors. He voted against it, along with the rest of the Australian Labor Party. So I suppose this is more about what it means to be impressed with style rather than substance. It means paying lip-service, as he did, to those hardworking Australians who want to be able to get out there, have a go and build their own businesses. They give them lip-service but do nothing to support them when it comes to a vote in this parliament. It is not what you say; it is what you do that counts. We saw in the vote this week what happened as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned.What we have seen here from the new Leader of the Opposition is the same old policy and the same trade unions dictating to the Leader of the Opposition what the industrial relations policy for those opposite will be. We understand that the member for Lalor is going to be their new spokesman in relation to this - from that firm Slater and Gordon, who were the paid guns for hire for the radical unions, the BLF and the CFMEU. She is going to get the job - clearly, a dictation from the unions and, in the future, it will be just the same with the policy. It may be a new leader, but it is the same old Labor.</DOC>

 - Yes, I do. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the question because it enables me to add, if I may, to my answer to the previous question on the same subject, which I was asked by the member for Swan. Because the member for Lalor has asked me a question about the minister and it relates obviously to her handling inter alia of the Ombudsman's report, I wonder if she as well as the member for Swan have forgotten that, in 1992, the former government had so many unlawful detainees that they introduced retrospective legislation - namely, the Migration Amendment Bill 1992 - limiting any compensation payable for unlawful detention to $1 a day. That was in 1992. - Hang on, it gets even better. The deputy has asked me the question and she is going to have to get the answer. They also moved legislation - maybe she has forgotten this - to legitimise what were unlawful detentions by changing the law retrospectively, where the member for Reid made clear that the purpose of the bill was to legitimise the detentions that occurred between 1989 and 1992, because the government at the time acted in good faith in detaining people. In fact, the former member for Prospect, Janice Crosio, who was then the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security, had this pearl of wisdom to say - which is so apposite and so relevant to the criticism we are now receiving from the Labor Party:In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was ... Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.In other words, when Labor was in government -  - any unlawful detention was an innocent and technical breach and no more; yet, when we are in government and something like that happens, it is the greatest assault on human rights since the Russian Revolution. It is absolutely outrageous. - I apologise to the Menchevists. They actually liked the Russian Revolution. But the hypocrisy. The member for Lalor ought to know better. She boasts about what a good immigration spokesman she was. On this issue, the Labor Party are a bunch of hypocrites.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and for his interest. I think many members of this House would have been, frankly, appalled by the scenes of senators in Fiji being forced out of parliament at gunpoint by armed soldiers. I am sure many members of the House saw that. I must say that I have also been very disturbed by reports of intimidation by the military of senior public servants and members of the media. One public servant was held to the ground and abused by a senior military officer. Overall, there has been substantial intimidation. The Australian government commends the bravery of those who are standing up to these morally corrupt actions. We continue to call on public servants and others in positions of authority in Fiji under the Fijian constitution to continue with passive resistance to Commodore Bainimarama's actions and demands. I am very encouraged by the many Fijians who are prepared to do this and Australia should get behind them.Of particular importance was the very welcome refusal by the Great Council of Chiefs to recognise the seizure of power by the military. The Great Council of Chiefs not only has a role within Fiji's constitution but also is, for the indigenous Fijians, a peak traditional body. The Great Council of Chiefs has cancelled a meeting scheduled for next week which Commodore Bainimarama had hoped he could use to install his caretaker government. The fact is that nevertheless Commodore Bainimarama has dismissed some of the more prominent among his civilian critics including the acting police commissioner, the Solicitor-General and the chief executive officer of the Prime Minister's office. He has become increasingly strident and aggressive in his statements directed at people - which is the vast majority of the Fijian people - who do not accept his preposterous takeover.International condemnation is flowing in from America, Britain, New Zealand, France and the EU, but even in the Pacific from Papua New Guinea, Samoa and from countries further afield, like South Africa and Canada. I note that Louise Arbour, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has said that the forcible and unconstitutional replacement of the government has raised serious concerns about the ability to guarantee rights and liberties. We will continue to call for passive resistance to this so-called administration. It is important that Australia stands by the ordinary people of Fiji and gives no comfort to a military dictator who is endeavouring to take over the country.</DOC>

 - After that, I am tempted to extend question time. I have two answers to that. The first answer is that the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition is ludicrous, wrong and completely unsupported by the facts. For example, for the first time, the federal Workplace Relations Act provides for a maximum of 38 ordinary hours of work per week. For the first time, the federal Workplace Relations Act provides for four weeks annual leave. For the first time, the federal Workplace Relations Act provides for 10 days personal carers leave. For the first time, the federal Workplace Relations Act provides two days paid compassionate leave per occasion. The federal Workplace Relations Act provides in law for 52 weeks of unpaid parental leave. In other words, Mr Speaker, the list goes on. - The question is based on a false premise. It goes deeper than that. This Christmas, Australians will enjoy - and this means enhanced enjoyment for many Australian families - the lowest level of unemployment in 30 years. The Leader of the Opposition says to me - through you always, Mr Speaker - 'How can the Prime Minister claim to lead a party of family values when et cetera, et cetera, et cetera is the case?' I might rhetorically reply and say: how can the Leader of the Opposition lead a party that presided over more than a million families not having a breadwinner in 1992? How can the Leader of the Opposition live with leading a political party that in 13 years drove the level of real wages down by 1.7 per cent? How can he live with leading a political party that saw hundreds of thousands of Australian children without either parent having a paid job? How can he claim to have at heart the interests of Australian families when he supports returning them to policies that will condemn this country to lower growth and lesser prosperity?As we all know, at Christmas the most important thing we do - for those whose values suggest it - is to enjoy the spirituality of the occasion and remember what it commemorates and the contribution to the world that the birth of that remarkable man represents. To millions of Australians, that is the great significance of Christmas. That is what gives Christmas its special place and its special nobility. Money is not everything at Christmas but, in order to ensure that the children of Australia enjoy Christmas to the greatest possible extent, their parents need to have jobs. Without jobs, they cannot afford to give them the Christmas they wanted. I am proud to lead a government that will go to this Christmas with the lowest level of unemployment in 30 years - more Australians in jobs and able to afford Christmas presents for their children than ever before; more ordinary Australians able to enjoy the joys of Christmas. That is what I am proud of. I can live with that, because it is the fruits of 10½ years hard work for the people of this great country.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>
