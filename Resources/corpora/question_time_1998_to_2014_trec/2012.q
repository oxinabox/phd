     I refer to a survey report, recently released by the Queensland chamber of commerce, that stated that over two-thirds of businesses believe the carbon tax will negatively impact upon them.
     It said:               _ the Australian business community will face the extraordinary challenge of competing against international businesses with much lower operating costs.
                   It went on to say that the carbon tax will affect the price of all goods and services and increase costs for all businesses.
     Will the Prime Minister scrap the world's largest carbon tax, or are expected job losses just more growing pains?

     The statement indicates that, because Slater &amp; Gordon acted for the AWU, the Prime Minister acted for Bruce Wilson personally and that, when Mr Wilson disclosed the use of the slush fund to purchase the Fitzroy property, Slater &amp; Gordon ceased acting for both clients.

     The AWU was unable to recover the funds as it knew nothing of the association she helped set up or its slush fund.
