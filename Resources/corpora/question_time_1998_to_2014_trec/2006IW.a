I am advised that:Nil.Nil.The department's financial reporting system does not distinguish wine from other alcoholic beverages purchased. The precise detail requested in the question is therefore not readily available and I am not prepared to authorise the commitment of resources required to provide a detailed response to the question. However, my department has prepared estimates of expenditure based on a twelve month sample period which indicated that wine constituted approximately 94% of alcohol purchased for the residences. On this basis, the estimated cost of wine purchased in 1998-99 was $29,516.Nil.$8,000$81.85On the basis of calculations as set out in (a)  -  (iii), the estimated cost of wine purchased in 1999-2000 was $40,499. This includes $16,877 for 58 dozen bottles of wine purchased under the plan prepared by the wine consultant, Mr Peter Bourne. Much of this was acquired in the lead up to the Olympic Games and therefore consumed in 2000-2001.$669$1,680NilOn the basis of calculations as set out in (a)  -  (iii), the estimated cost of wine purchased in 2000-2001 was $21,308.$672</DOC>

As at 30 June 2005, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) liability was estimated to be $46,755,592,000.As at the end of the previous ten financial years, the liability for the CSS was estimated to be:YearCSS2003-04$46,907,813,0002002-03$50,522,600,0002001-02$45,929,452,0002000-01$44,697,767,0001999-00$44,079,400,0001998-99$40,000,925,0001997-98$38,000,000,0001996-97$38,000,000,0001995-96$40,000,000,0001994-95$40,000,000,000         The assets of the CSS as at 30 June 2005, were $6,014,647,000.The CSS Board has obtained actuarial advice concerning the likely size of the CSS Fund at 30 June 2013. The future size of the CSS Fund will be impacted by a number of factors, the most important of which are:·      investment returns·      retirement, resignation and retrenchment rates, and·      the proportion of resignees and retirees who retain a preserved benefit in the CSS.Whilst it is impossible to precisely predict each of the above variables, the actuarial work shows that the CSS Fund's projected assets are likely to be between $4.0 billion and $4.4 billion at 30 June 2013.The Government has already taken decisions to address the growth in its unfunded superannuation liabilities. These include paying out $4.6 billion to fully extinguish its liabilities relating to the Telstra and Australia Post superannuation schemes and closing the existing Public Sector Superannuation Scheme defined benefit plan to new members from 1 July 2005 and instead providing them with fully funded accumulation benefits.Also, as announced in the 2005-06 Budget, the Government will establish the Future Fund to accumulate financial assets to offset the Australian Government's unfunded superannuation liabilities.The Government will build assets in the Future Fund with the aim of fully offsetting the Australian Government's unfunded superannuation liability by 2020.This compares with the following years by which the States expect to have their respective schemes fully funded:NSW - 2030ACT - 2040NT - 2060WA - 2021VIC - 2035TAS - 2018SA - 2034QLD has already fully funded its superannuation obligations.</DOC>

Detainees currently have a health assessment, including a broad mental health screen and a suicide and self harm risk assessment, on arrival. Screening of all detainees using internationally recognized mental health instruments (by staff trained in their use) is currently being implemented. The instruments to be used are the clinician rated Health of the Nation Outcomes Scale (HoNOS), the client rated Kessler 10 (K 10). The HoNOS and K 10 are widely used in mainstream mental health services. The K 10 in particular is very well validated in different cultures and available in many languages.There are key requirements in the Detention Services Contract in relation to mental health services. This contract is publicly available. Operational Procedures provide further detail on how these requirements work in practice (Attached).Departmental staff (drawing on expert advice as required) monitor service delivery against contract requirements. Financial penalties are enacted against the Detention Services Provider (GSL) if services and protocols are not met.The department has commissioned a number of clinical audits of health services through Knowledge Consulting undertaken by members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. A Health Advisory Panel will be convened in the near future and will develop health standards to serve as a base for auditing.The complaints mechanisms currently in place were developed in consultation with the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office. Immigration detainees are able (and are encouraged) to raise matters first with GSL and departmental officers at the immigration detention facility, either individually or as a group. In addition, or alternatively, approaches can be made directly to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office and/or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Contact details for both these organisations are prominently displayed throughout all immigration detention facilities.It is unclear what change in practice or procedure the journalist refers to in the article. For many years outside expertise has been engaged, where required, to facilitate appropriate health services for immigration detainees.Regulation 5.35 of the Migration Regulations was made in 1994. It enables the Secretary of the department to personally authorise medical treatment without the consent of the detainee in certain circumstances.Detainees with a mental illness are reviewed and treated by psychiatrists. The following table gives the number of detainee consultations with psychiatrists in the year 2005, (as at 2 November 2005).Month (2005)BaxterVillawoodMaribyrnongPerthJanuary 200517 0 00February 2005 0 0 00March 2005 0 0 80April 200510 0 10May 200510 1 60June 20052011150July 20052810141August 20051817 78September 20052020 20October 2005 720 51As in the general community, prescription of medication for mental illness is a private matter between the treating doctor and their patient. Aggregate data regarding the number of detainees on prescribed medication for a mental illness is not collected.A range of treatments are available to all detainees and is provided as per the recommendations of the treating health professionals which could include a GP, nursing staff, a psychiatrist, psychologist and/or counsellor.A detainee need only inform the Manager of an immigration detention facility that an external psychiatrist is attending the facility to examine that detainee. The detainee is responsible for all costs.A detainee is only transferred to a mental health treatment facility on the recommendation of the treating health professionals.On referral of the treating health professional a detainee is transferred to an appropriate place of health care.Yes. However, when there are two conflicting medical opinions as to the care required for a detainee, an independent third opinion is sought.The department's practice is to follow the treating health professionals' advice in regard to the treatment and location of a detainee. The department now routinely obtains third opinions when advice is received from non-treating medical practitioners that conflicts with the advice provided by the detainee's treating doctor/s.(a)   Placements in the Management Support Unit (MSU) occur only when there is no viable alternative and it would be unsafe or would present an unacceptable risk for the individual to remain in a mainstream setting.(b)   Alternative measures are considered should a placement of a detainee in a MSU exceed 48 hours.(c)   The Operational Procedures provide that detainees in a MSU are to be seen daily by qualified medical staff. Referrals are made, where required, to further specialist services including psychological support or counselling.The Palmer Inquiry has commented on this matter.I am aware of the comment by the psychologist.At the time asked, visits by a visiting psychiatrist to Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) took place around every six weeks depending on case requirements. Such a visit took place on 6 November 2004. The medical staff determined in early December that no immigration detainees required urgent appointments before February with the visiting psychiatrist.The visiting psychiatrist now attends Baxter IDF every two weeks - or more frequently if required. Acute psychiatric assessment and interventions are available at any time in accordance with protocols negotiated with the South Australian Mental Health Unit.A General Practitioner medical clinic is conducted at Baxter IDF every week day and a GP is on call 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The GPs are able to (and do) refer persons with mental health issues to appropriate mental health professionals.The South Australian Public Advocate has not been refused access to Baxter IDF. I have received confirmation from the Public Advocate that he did not seek access to Ms Rau prior to her discharge from the Baxter IDF.</DOC>

Yes.A psychologist saw Ms Rau the day after she arrived at Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) and the visiting psychiatrist saw her a month later on 6 November 2004.Yes. These issues were referred to the Palmer Inquiry.Following Mr Palmer's recommendations, mental health services have been enhanced at Baxter IDF. The Detention Services Provider (GSL) provides training in observing, recognising and reporting behaviour and signs that may be symptomatic of mental illness. Mechanisms are also being put in place to ensure that significant concerns about the wellbeing of any detainee, as expressed by Detention Services Officers, other detainees and visitors is communicated to medical staff, in a timely manner, to allow this information to be taken into account in the mental health assessment process. Whenever DIMIA staff have concerns regarding a detainee's mental health they are required to bring these to the immediate attention of treating medical staff.A Detention Health Services Taskforce has been established to develop a detention health strategy to implement improvements to health services at all immigration detention facilities.A table is provided giving the number of Baxter detainees who saw a psychiatrist, reflected against the total number of detainees in Baxter IDF in the year 2005 (as at 2 November). It should be noted that not all these consultations were for 'psychotic behaviour'.Baxter Immigration Detention FacilityMonth (2005)Number of detainees who consulted the psychiatristTotal number of detainees in BaxterJanuary 200517258February 20050263March 20050301April 200510213May 200510215June 200520229July 200528164August 200518259September 200520168October 20057259A psychiatrist visits the Baxter IDF every 2 weeks  -  or more frequently if required. The visiting psychiatrist is also available for telephone consultation, as required.There is a nursing service on-site at Baxter IDF 24 hours a day, seven days per week and nurse clinics are run six days per week.to (8) Immigration detention is administrative detention and cannot be directly compared with correctional detention. However, given that there are some similarities my Department has drawn on the expert advice of a medical and health consultant with a detailed knowledge of, and experience in, health care within state correctional environments to assist it in oversighting the delivery of health services by treating health professionals in immigration detention facilities.Immigration detention will continue to be administered according to the provisions of the Migration Act 1958.In February 2005, I announced the following changes to strengthen procedures relating to immigration detention, particularly the administration of complex cases.A 28 day limit  -  in all but exceptional circumstances  -  on the time immigration detainees can be held in prison, a watch-house or similar state corrections facility in those jurisdictions where an immigration detention facility is not available.Following regulatory changes people detained can be required to provide a finger print without their consent where necessary.Further advice has been given to staff to clarify and strengthen procedures that are to be followed to try to establish a person's identity.I have written to the Justice Minister, Senator Ellison, asking him to formally pursue the issue of access to data bases with relevant Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies. I have also asked the Secretary of my Department to pursue the same issue with the Heads of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Agencies (HOCOLEA).Where a person's identity or status is not confirmed within 28 days, departmental staff are required to consult with senior staff in Canberra on the ongoing management of the case.</DOC>

No.The role and composition of a National Infrastructure Advisory Council would depend on the terms under which it was established. However, by definition an advisory council would not be able to 'independently determine state and federal responsibilities'.to (4) It is my understanding that the Business Council of Australia has called for a better planned and coordinated approach to infrastructure issues through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) or establishment of an alternative peak intergovernmental body. The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development has called for COAG to consider the establishment of a National Infrastructure Advisory Council with expert non-government representation.Following consideration of issues raised in the Export Infrastructure Report by the Prime Minister's Taskforce, COAG has established its own arrangements to progress strategic transport policy issues. Further details are available in the COAG Communiqué of 3 June 2005.</DOC>

The Australian Government announced on 7 June 2005 a number of additional measures to further strengthen security at Australia's major airports.For example, the Australian Government is introducing requirements at major airports to intensify the inspection of persons, vehicles and goods entering and leaving secure airside areas.The Australian Government is removing the legal obstacles to increased use of video surveillance in all areas of airports, including baggage holds of aircraft.The Australian Government commenced an independent review of law enforcement and aviation security at airports by the Rt Hon Sir John Wheeler JP, DL. The report was released on 21 September 2005 and made a number of recommendations to improve policing and security to better combat criminal and terrorist activity.The Prime Minister announced a range of initiatives on 21 September 2005 as the Australian Government's initial response to the Report. These initiatives will further tighten security at Australia's major airports, by providing enhanced CCTV capabilities at major airports, establishing Joint Airport Investigation Teams, increasing airside Customs border patrols, and strengthening air cargo security arrangements.The Department of Transport and Regional Services does not operate cameras at Sydney Airport. A number of entities do maintain security cameras at Sydney Airport. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the cameras rests with those who have installed and operate them, including aviation industry participants and border control agencies.</DOC>

I have been advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that the telecommunications industry does not report on the take-up of ADSL services by electoral division.Telstra has advised that all of its telephone exchanges in the electoral division of Adelaide have spare capacity to provide additional ADSL services. A number of other carriers have also installed infrastructure that allows them to provide ADSL services to customers in the electoral division of Adelaide.Telstra has advised that it has processes in place to augment its capacity to deliver ADSL services as demand increases where it is commercially viable to do so. In situations where ADSL is not available, Telstra and other Internet service providers have invested in alternative broadband access platforms such as Hybrid Fibre Co-axial Cable, wireless and satellite to service the demand for broadband.</DOC>

Phone lines are not physically disconnected when an account name is changed.Providing customers with a 'contact officer' for phone transitions is not necessarily the most efficient or effective approach from the customer's perspective. To provide the customer with contact details for a dedicated staff member may potentially delay assistance to customers as help would be subject to that person's availability at the time of contact. Telstra advised that customers who telephone for assistance are attended to by the first available consultant. Telstra further advised that its customer databases have the capacity to store historical notes in relation to customer requests or queries, so that its staff have relevant information at hand.Telstra has advised that there are some circumstances where a customer may receive an additional account or reminder notice for a service that has been cancelled. As customers pay their line rental in advance, they may receive a bill that was in the process of being distributed at the time of cancellation, and receive a subsequent bill reconciling any outstanding or pre-paid amounts on the account. Customers may also receive a reminder notice if they fail to pay their account on time. Customers with more than one service packaged onto a single bill who cancel a fixed line service would subsequently receive accounts for the services not cancelled.No.Compensation paid by various telecommunications companies under the Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) for connection delays is reported annually by the Australian Communications and Media Authority in its Telecommunications Performance Report. Compensation paid to small business and residential consumers in aggregate is reported. Compensation paid to small business and residential consumers for not meeting CSG requirements in relation to fault rectification times and the meeting of appointments is also reported.In addition to compensation paid under the CSG, businesses also may receive compensation from telecommunications companies that is not expressly intended to meet CSG requirements. This includes compensation paid pursuant to a determination made by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or as a result of legal action taken by a business.</DOC>

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) is not aware of any organisation funded to deliver services on our behalf that requires their employees to meet certain religious requirements as a condition of employment.Organisations delivering DIMIA services are required to comply with all laws of the state or territory in which they are incorporated and/or operating. They must also comply with any relevant statutes, regulations, by-laws and requirements of the Commonwealth and any State, Territory or local authority.DIMIA does not provide funding to any organisations for programs that include the provision of religious instruction or faith based counselling.Some Living in Harmony community grants do address inter-faith issues which seek to promote understanding of religious diversity rather than to promote religion or particular faiths.Organisations funded by DIMIA to deliver services have contracts or service agreements that specify the range of services to be delivered, regardless of the character or nature of the organisation, rather than activities not to be undertaken.Consistent with the Charter of a Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society, funded organisations are expected to deliver services that are sensitive and responsive to the religious values, cultural and linguistic needs of our clients.State and Territory-based departmental officers monitor the delivery of contracts and service agreements closely. Organisations receive payment for services on a milestone basis once agreed work outputs have been achieved.DIMIA also has extensive relationships with community organisations that provide a vehicle for feedback on issues such as this.</DOC>

In April 2005, I announced that pharmacies could expect to receive total payments of $11.75 billion over the life of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement, as compared with total payments of $8.4 billion made under the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement.This amount was based on the official, Australian Government 2004-05 Estimates of PBS prescription volumes and average price, and included $500 million in funding for pharmacy development and other professional programs.At the time, this represented a nominal increase in total payments of 40%. When adjusted for inflation over the five years of the Fourth Agreement, real growth in total payments represented 30%.The Forward Estimates for the PBS were revised in August 2005. As a result of this revision, and the negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, payments to pharmacists and pharmaceutical wholesalers over the life of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement, are now estimated to be $11.1 billion. The additional $500 million for professional pharmacy programs and services remains unchanged, bringing the estimated total payments to $11.6 billion over the life of the Fourth Agreement.This represents real growth in payments to pharmacists of 28%, over the Third Agreement.Payments to pharmacies over the life of the Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement include funding for:·    wholesale margin, for the supply and distribution of PBS prescription medicines;·    pharmacy retail mark-up, for the storage and handling of PBS medicines; and·    a dispensing fee, to cover professional pharmacy services.These arrangements are consistent with existing payment arrangements under the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement. Pharmacies use these payments to negotiate the purchase, distribution and supply of PBS medicines with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers, under normal commercial arrangements.The wholesale margin and pharmacy retail mark-up paid to pharmacists is based on the cost of each PBS item. Pharmacist remuneration therefore rises with the cost and volume of PBS medicines dispensed.The cost of PBS medicines has been rising at an average rate of 12% per year, well above inflation. Pharmacy expenses as a percentage of sales have decreased by 4% over the last four years. While expenses have increased, sales have increased at a faster rate.Community pharmacists play an important role in providing a range of professional, diagnostic and other services. These services are funded by a combination of government and consumer payments to pharmacies, and retail mark-ups included in the price of goods sold. Funding provided by the government includes remuneration for both the distribution and supply of PBS medicines (wholesale margin), and for storage and handling (retail mark-up).Pharmacists also receive a fee for every PBS medicine dispensed. The dispensing fee pays the pharmacist for the professional attention and care given to patients at the time of dispensing, including counselling on the proper use of medicines, side effects and self management of the condition being treated.Negotiations for a Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Australian Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia have now concluded.As part of these negotiations, the government and the Pharmacy Guild undertook a joint review of the existing pharmacy location arrangements. This review has informed the revised location arrangements that form part of the Fourth Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Government has agreed to extend existing restrictions on pharmacies located within supermarkets, for the period of the Fourth Agreement.</DOC>

Since 1995-96 the value of Australia's annual goods and services exports has increased from $99.2 billion to $163.2 billion in 2004-05.In 2002/03, as part of the Government's trade policy agenda an ambitious program to broaden and diversify Australia's export base was developed by introducing a new generation of businesses to exporting. Austrade has taken the lead role in co-ordinating the whole of government approach to the ambitious, aspirational goal of doubling the number of Australian exporters by 2006-07.The international environment for Australian exporters has been challenging and affected by a number of events, including the appreciation of the Australian currency, the impact of the prolonged drought on our rural communities, SARS, terrorism and oil prices. However, some major gains have been achieved. There are now more small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) joining the exporter community. In fact, ABS figures show such businesses now make up 87 per cent of all exporters.Austrade's results so far suggest the goal has helped it to become increasingly proactive in its outlook. In 2004-05, Austrade assisted 1,717 new and irregular exporters achieve export success. This represents an increase of nearly 400 per cent in the number of successful new and irregular exporters since 2002-03.In aggregate, Austrade helped 4,358 clients achieve export success in 2004-05, which is a threefold increase on the 1,506 clients assisted in 2001-02. Exporter sustainability, as shown in ABS figures, is increasing with 68 per cent of exporters now considered 'regular' exporters, compared to 55 per cent in the mid-1990s.The Government has provided $21.5 million from 2002-03 to 2005-06 to fund the TradeStart network. TradeStart is a national network of 50 offices that provides resources, advice and expertise necessary to help Australian businesses export successfully with a particular focus on new and irregular exporters and SMEs, especially in regional and rural Australia.Austrade also received funding of $6.4 million over 5 years from 1 July 2005 to establish 8 Export Hubs aimed at enhancing access to services for businesses in regional areas - the Export Hubs will offer the services of both TradeStart and AusIndustry to assist companies commercialise and grow through internationalisation.Funding for the Austrade-administered Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme has been boosted by $30 million up until 2007 which will allow Austrade to assist more small and medium sized Australian businesses to enter export, and become sustainable exporters. The EMDG scheme concentrates on assisting smaller businesses and less-experienced exporters. In 2004-05, 77% of recipients had $5 million or less in annual income and 31% received their first grant under the scheme.Austrade's current export promotion programs and initiatives all seek to maximise the number of new exporters assisted to win international business. Two programs that have received specific funding this year and which are expected to contribute to Austrade's goal of doubling the number of exporters are:- New Exporters  -  New Opportunities - $13.5 million has been allocated over 4 years from 2004-05 to deliver programs that enable Australian exporters to capitalise on emerging trade opportunities in the FTA markets of Singapore, Thailand and the US, as well as opportunities in growth markets such as China- US FTA - $25 million over 3 years has been provided to help Australian businesses take advantage of opportunities arising from the US free trade agreement through the creation of 30 new export facilitator positions.Austrade has been actively building its links with potential new exporters through enhanced marketing activities, export awareness seminars and working closely with allies. These efforts include establishing professional development programs for a broad range of large professional service providers, for example, accounting and legal firms, who can work with Austrade to provide information and activities to promote export options and opportunities to their own client base.Since 1 July 2002, Austrade has developed and delivered two programs specifically focussed on growing the number of exporters - the New Exporter Development Program (NEDP) and Tradestart.NEDP is a package of 'free of charge' export services delivered by Austrade and TradeStart that are designed to assist small and medium-sized Australian companies develop their businesses overseas and make their first export sale.- The aim is to provide Australian businesses with the best possible start to exporting, by providing a wide range of services including advice and information about getting into exporting, market selection, export coaching and some free assistance on the ground in foreign markets.- As at 30 June 2005, the total number of active clients on the NEDP was 4,825, with 1,826 additional clients signed onto the program in 2004-05.Since 1 July 2002 the TradeStart Network has generated the following outcomes:- 836 new exporters making an export sale (965 export successes);- $213.3 million worth of export sales;- 50 offices across Australia involving 29 TradeStart partners representing Austrade and promoting the Government's trade facilitation services across regional development groups, industry associations and state governments.These programs are additional to Austrade's core business activities that also seek to identify and win export business for new exporters. In 2005/06, Austrade will particularly promote opportunities in FTA markets, growth markets such as India and China and in industry sectors where significant gains can be achieved in terms of exporter numbers and/or export dollars.The Government has a comprehensive trade policy, including WTO and FTA negotiations to encourage the success of Australian businesses in international markets and thereby increase national prosperity.Australia's export success is, however, also dependent on external events  -  such as business confidence in security conditions, the impact of the continuing drought in Australia and the exchange rate movements affecting the competitiveness of our products and services. The Government's comprehensive trade policy framework gives Australian exporters the greatest opportunity to achieve future export success.The Government remains committed to encouraging and supporting an increasing number of new exporters while also focusing on assisting established exporters to consolidate their export position, expand into new markets and increase their export value.Austrade is working more closely with industry, corporate allies and other Australian government agencies and the States and Territories to help realise the short term, and longer term, export potential for Australian businesses.In 2004-05, Austrade assisted 4,358 businesses to achieve export success, a 32% increase on the 2003-04 results of 3,315 businesses. The dollar value of exports over the same period grew by 36% from $13,476 billion to $18,364 billion. Within the context of the Government's comprehensive trade policy, Austrade will assist more Australian businesses to achieve export success in 2005-06.</DOC>

This question seeks a large amount of information, much of which is already on the public record. For example, details about SES remuneration levels and expenditure on consultancies have been contained in each department's annual report for several years.Many parts of the question seek information that is not readily available, the compilation of which would require a significant diversion of resources which no minister acting reasonably would authorise. Other parts seek information that is no longer retained in accordance with established (and/or longstanding) archival practice.The efficient and effective use of Australian government resources is in the public interest.The diversion of resources required, for instance, to itemise the date, time, cost, departure and destination of each Cabcharge transaction since 1 July 1996 is neither a good use of those resources nor of any substantial public interest.In these circumstances, the government has instructed each department not to prepare an answer to any part of the honourable member's question.</DOC>

Telstra has advised that, where available, ISDN provides a service comprising two data channels, each capable of delivering data at a rate of 64 kilobits per second (kbit/s). Telstra has advised that all pair gain systems currently in use in its network, which have an ISDN capability, allow customers with appropriate premises equipment to link the two data channels in order to access the Internet at a speed of 128 kbit/s.For those customers who are able to access ISDN, the connection may be slowed down if they choose to access the Internet by using an analogue rather than a digital modem. The use of an analogue modem with an ISDN connection will prevent the customer from receiving standard ISDN speeds regardless of whether a pair gain system is in use in the network.Telstra has advised that it uses a path compatible with the provision of ADSL to support the requested service if such a path is available for use.There are a number of telecommunications service providers currently offering ADSL services to premises in the electoral division of Newcastle. They include but are not limited to Telstra, aaNet, Optus, Exetel, Westnet, Internode, TPG Internet, Netspace, iiNet, Datafast and Swiftel.It is not possible to offer ADSL services to premises where the telephone service is provided via an incompatible pair gain service. As a result, no telecommunications service provider can offer ADSL services to premises such as these in the electoral division of Newcastle.and (b) Telstra has advised that Telstra Infrastructure Services will attempt to provide an economically viable ADSL capable path for orders for ADSL from Telstra Retail and from other ISPs through Telstra Wholesale. The Telstra Infrastructure Services' process is the same for all applications regardless of the source.Telstra has advised that for the month of August 2005, the average time for an ADSL service provisioning order that included a transposition to be completed was: (a) 13.24 working days when the application was made through Telstra Retail, and (b) 14.02 working days when the application was made through Telstra Wholesale.</DOC>

The Government's ability to directly influence the price of petrol is limited, but there are steps that can and are being taken to ensure the Australian petroleum industry operates effectively.As internationally traded commodities the price of crude oil and refined petroleum (for example petrol and diesel) are subject to changes in supply and demand on a global scale. Accordingly, the Australian petroleum industry and subsequently the domestic retail petrol price are directly influenced by international factors. The closure of United States' refineries due to the devastating impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the petroleum export embargo by China have resulted in international shortages and driven up the global price of petrol. The Australian Government has no control over these events and subsequently no control over the effect on international prices.This view has in fact been supported by the Member for Rankin who writing in The Age on 20 July 2005 said 'Australia's record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only  -  high world oil prices.'The Australian price of both crude oil and refined petroleum are directly related to the relative prices in the Asia-Pacific. More specifically, the relevant benchmark for crude oil is Tapis Crude Oil (produced in Malaysia) and for refined petroleum, the spot price of petrol in Singapore (Mogas 95 Octane Unleaded) is used. As the closest trading region Australian producers and refiners use Asia-Pacific as the benchmark. Approximately twenty per cent of refined petroleum sold in Australia is imported from the Asia-Pacific region and this would also be the alternative sales market. If the price available in Australia was significantly less than in Singapore the importation of petroleum would not be viable and Australian refiners would have an incentive to shift supply to that region, which may result in shortages in Australia.As a general principle the government tries to avoid becoming involved in the pricing considerations and market factors in any industry, including the petroleum sector. On this basis and despite calls for increased powers for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), changes to the taxation regime, and use of the government's surplus to alleviate hardship, the government is reluctant to intervene to force the price of petrol down through legislation or other means.That said, the ACCC already undertakes extensive informal monitoring of petrol, diesel and auto LPG prices at over 4,000 sites across Australia, as well as the international crude oil, refined petroleum, and wholesale prices. The ACCC publishes much of this information on its website and recently announced that retailer margins will also be published in order to further inform and educate consumers. Informed consumers, both individuals and businesses, can exert downward pressure on prices and increase understanding of the operation of the petrol market. In addition, the ACCC has and will continue to investigate complaints of price fixing, predatory pricing and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry and take legal action where appropriate.In relation to the debate about taxation and revenue received by the Australian Government from higher petrol prices, it is the case that fuel excise is levied on a volumetric basis at a fixed rate, 38.143 cents per litre. As petrol prices rise, the Australian Government receives no more or no less revenue from the fuel excise. While GST revenue from petrol sales may increase as prices rise, all revenue from GST goes to the states and may not result in increased aggregate GST collections because increases in expenditure by households on fuel may be offset by reduced expenditure on other goods and services.However, the government has in the past and continues to make changes to the tax system where appropriate to benefit the public, including reducing the fuel excise with the introduction of GST in 2000 by 6.7 cents per litre, removing automatic indexation of the fuel excise and further cutting excise by 1.5 cents per litre in 2001 and the recently announced decision not to proceed with a previously planned increase in the excise of petrol to provide grants to refineries to produce low sulphur fuels. In addition the government is continuing to progress a major programme of reform to modernise and simplify the fuel tax system as well as long term reforms to the excise treatment of alternative fuels, establishing a fairer and more tax-neutral, transparent fuel excise system.Furthermore, on 22 September 2005, I released the report of the Biofuels Taskforce, reaffirmed the government's commitment to the 350 megalitre biofuel production target by 2010, and announced a package of measures designed to address the key market barriers. The Australian Government will work with oil companies, petrol retailers, consumer groups, the biofuels industry and car manufacturers to ensure achievement of the target. In particular the government will work with the major oil companies to develop Industry Action Plans to underpin the achievement of the 350 megalitre target.In addition to the above the Australian Government is continuing to look at ways of improving the regulatory framework of the petroleum industry and in particular the implementation of the Downstream Petroleum Reform Package. The Australian Government considers repeal of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and mandating an industry code, the Trade Practices (Industry Codes - Oilcode) Regulations 2005, under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974 will provide significant benefits to the industry.In summary, as the Australian petroleum industry operates in a global environment there are a range of international factors that influence the domestic retail price of petrol. The Australian Government, like all governments around the world, is not able to influence or control those price fluctuations. But, I have outlined a range of measures that the government is undertaking in an attempt to improve the operation of the petroleum sector and provide a long-term sustainable industry.</DOC>

Yes. Push Productions were engaged to provide Flash animation for two existing comics entitled Get Smart and Get that job. The total cost of this was $17,600 including GST.The Get Smart comic depicts a group of young people who visit a Job Network member (JNM) to help them to find work. The comic outlines the type of assistance available and encourages young people to find work by signing up with a JNM.The Get that job comic targets Indigenous youth. It depicts a young Indigenous male who uses JNM services to help him evaluate his job prospects and to tackle his difficulties with reading and writing.The two animated comics were published on the redeveloped JobJuice website (www.jobjuice.gov.au) in July 2005.Market research conducted prior to the redevelopment of the JobJuice website indicated that youth audiences responded effectively to comics and to animated features on websites. When the comics were originally developed in hard copy the concepts were tested and proved an effective means of communicating with the target groups. The justification to spend money on animating these comics was based on this market research.</DOC>

Telstra has advised that information identifying the annual average fault rate affecting Telstra's Customer Access Network (CAN) was provided to the Minister on 11 August 2005. The fault rate for 2004-05 is 14.03 per cent. The media mistakenly reported that Telstra had advised the Government 14 in 100 of Telstra's telephone lines were faulty.The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) advise it did not provide the fault information to the Minister. ACMA does not report fault information relating to Telstra's CAN on this basis.The Network Reliability Framework (NRF) commenced in January 2003 and obliges Telstra to report to ACMA the percentage of services that have a fault in a month nationally and in each of Telstra's 44 Field Service Areas (FSAs).ACMA reports that for each month in:2003 - 04, an average of 99.11 per cent of services in Australia did not have a fault;2004 - 05, an average of 99.06 per cent of services in Australia did not have a fault.Data from years preceding commencement of the NRF in January 2003 is not available from ACMA.There are 5,058 exchange service areas (ESAs) nationwide. Each supports a non-standard number of telecommunications services, including a large number with 100 or fewer services connected. Telstra advise that the information requested is unable to be supplied because of the volume of data required to be analysed and customer privacy considerations.</DOC>

Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Strategy aims to deliver a continuum of care on a number of different levels for the education and treatment of ADF personnel concerning problematic alcohol and substance use. Additionally, the Royal Australian Navy Alcohol and Drug Program (RAN ADP), which has been running since the early 1980s, is progressively integrating with the ADF Mental Health Strategy.The first level focuses on improving literacy of all ADF members through presentations and the provision of information in the form of printed and electronic information. Targets include point of entry groups such as new entry officers and recruits as well as all other ADF personnel.The next level involves the delivery of multi-faceted programs that aim to assist the ADF members in modifying their own behaviours so that they will not indulge in moderate-risk or high-risk consumption of alcohol. Two new programs, developed by the ADF Mental Health Strategy, called 'Keep Your Mate Safe' and the Outpatient Alcohol Treatment Program are currently being implemented within Defence by trained Defence mental health professions.'Keep Your Mate Safe' is a one-day face-to-face facilitated course that utilises the social connectedness of the group and other resources to encourage responsible socialising and low - risk consumption of alcohol. The course is usually run following a formal request by a Commander.The Outpatient Alcohol Treatment Program, a four-day program, aims to help participants by identifying those factors that affect their alcohol consumption, specifically their attitudes and motivations. The participants learn about various techniques and strategies that have been proven useful in modifying an individual's behaviour towards low-risk consumption of alcohol. The program provides follow-up by an alcohol and other drugs professional to help the participant achieve the program objectives. The program is ideally delivered close to the participants' unit so that they can attend as outpatients.Treatment for problematic alcohol use is provided to ADF members through the existing comprehensive ADF health services including Defence health and allied health professionals. Agreements have also been made with most state and territory alcohol and other drug services for the provision of high-level clinical services (including detoxification when necessary) to ADF members when required. The ADF also operates an in-patient alcohol treatment facility, known as the Alcohol Rehabilitation and Education Program (AREP); this program does not treat personnel with dependencies on illicit substances.Defence members who require treatment for problematic use of an illicit substance will be provided with health support and may be referred to a specialist agency outside of Defence if this is more appropriate. However, all members who are found to be using illicit substances will face administrative action and will be required to show cause why they should be retained in the ADF.The RAN maintains a peer-based alcohol and drug program that has operated since the 1980s. The RAN ADP, as well as delivering the products of the ADF Mental Health Strategy to their members, also delivers the following:Preventative education through career training that includes entry and promotion courses.Supervisory level courses for members who want to gain more knowledge in alcohol and other drug management in the workplace.Alcohol and Drug Program Adviser courses have been important in providing support to members and command. The course is being upgraded and is soon to be co-presented with TAFE educators at certificate 4 level.Primary and tertiary intervention/treatment(s) are provided by RAN ADP peers and counsellors in conjunction with ADF alcohol tobacco and other drugs service trained personnel.The provision of services for the treatment of problematic alcohol and other drug use occurs through all ADF health facilities by ADF-employed staff. Only AREP Richmond has contracted outside organisations, on behalf of Defence, since 2000 and it contracts these providers to maintain the delivery of the program. The RAN ADP provides services to RAN members across the ADF, however, full-time RAN ADP staff are located at:HMAS Stirling for delivery of RAN ADP counselling for ships and establishments in Western Australia and the Northern Territory;HMAS Cerberus for delivery of RAN ADP counselling for ships and establishments in South Australia and Tasmania;HMAS Kuttabul for delivery of RAN ADP counselling for ships and establishments in New South Wales (NSW), Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory; andthe Alcohol Rehabilitation Program is delivered at Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Richmond, NSW.Since 2000, AREP at RAAF Richmond, NSW has contracted outside agencies for:Alcohol and other drug counseling, clinical supervision and medical officer support for Alcohol Rehabilitation Program.Australian Institute of Counselling in Addictions, StatLocum, Red Recruiting and Frontier Counselling Pty Ltd.No.The contractor staff at AREP have the following qualifications:Program Coordinator: Graduate Diploma in Addictions Counseling, Certificate IV in Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) studies, Graduate Certificate in Addictions Studies.Counsellor A: Certificate IV in AOD studies.Counsellor B: Master of Counselling, Bachelor of Arts (Social Welfare), Certificate IV in AOD studies.Clinical Supervisor: Certificate in Addictions Counselling, Graduate Diploma in Addictions, Certificate in Gestalt Psychotherapy (group and individual).Medical Officer: MB ChB, Psychiatry Registrar, Member of Australian College of Psychological Medicine, unconditional registration NSW Medical Board., (b) and (c) Since 2000, there has been one formal complaint against treatment modalities used at AREP. This complaint was made to Defence Health Service. The matter was investigated initially by the Commanding Officer, No 3 Combat Support Hospital. A follow-up investigation by the Joint Health Support Agency and a Defence Health Services Investigating Officer was conducted. The allegations were not substantiated, and there was no case to answer.The ADF has received several letters outlining concerns about the treatment services at AREP in the past, and these have been incorporated into the ongoing evaluation and development of the services provided by this establishment.One formal complaint about the general direction taken by the ADF in the treatment of problematic substance use was raised with me in 2004. A response was provided, and a programmed evaluation of the ADF Alcohol Tobacco and Other Drugs Service is currently under way. The report for this was provided to the ADF in November 2005.</DOC>

Film Australia Limited's operations occupy a little less than two-thirds of its Lindfield site. The remaining third is let to 20 to 22 independent industry tenants on a short or long term basis. During the 2004-05 financial year, on average, only between three and eight per cent of the complex was vacant. As of the week beginning 10 October 2005, the site was fully occupied.Parts of the complex may be vacant for differing periods of time between tenancies.
Old Parliament House
Old Parliament House is primarily a museum of social and political history, as well as a function venue. Although portions of the building are occupied by the Australian Electoral Commission's Electoral Education Centre and a number of smaller tenants, it is not a function of Old Parliament House to provide rentable space for office accommodation or other purposes.Other than a small amount of office space which may be used for temporary overflow purposes by Old Parliament House/ Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Old Parliament House currently does not contain any vacant space that is considered to be habitable or rentable by modern standards.

Telstra and its predecessors, Post Master General and Telecom, have not purchased any asbestos from James Hardies Industries since approximately 1986.Telstra's predecessors purchased cement pits and pipes containing asbestos (approximately 5 - 15% asbestos content depending on the type of product) from Hardies from about 1955 until about 1986 when these products were replaced with plastic alternatives. This material was purchased by government tender and Telstra is unable to provide details of the exact quantities purchased or used.Telstra has also noted that it is also likely that the vehicles used by Telstra's predecessors contained asbestos friction products or brake linings purchased from Hardie Ferodo and Better Brakes, which was part of the James Hardie group of companies, as these were available in the public domain.The Telstra network still contains pits made of cement with some asbestos content. These pits and pipes are comprised of asbestos cement with the pits containing approximately 5-15% asbestos bonded in a cement and silica matrix and the pipes containing 15% asbestos bonded in a cement and silica matrix. As this asbestos is bound to the cement and in low concentrations it does not present a hazard, unless friable (where the fibres become loose and airborne). In the case of pits and pipes, (as they are bound in a cement matrix) the asbestos fibres are not likely to become friable unless ground by a powered machine such as an electric grinder.Where exchange buildings contain in situ asbestos, these are documented and managed as per the processes outlined in the response to part (4). This is similar to other public and private buildings where in situ asbestos is present.Telstra employees and contractors will come into contact from time to time with material containing asbestos during maintenance of underground installations or buildings. All contact is regulated by the asbestos management processes referred to in the response to part (4).Telstra is required to  -  and does  -  comply with requirements of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) Code of Practice on Asbestos. Compliance is enforced by the Safety and Rehabilitation Commission (SRC) through its operational arm Comcare Australia.Briefly, the processes for the management of asbestos in Telstra involves:The maintenance of an Asbestos Register at all exchanges that have asbestos;All pits and pipes which are not plastic are treated as containing asbestos;The regular inspection, maintenance or removal (if necessary) of the asbestos;All employees and contractors to observe strict guidelines for working in proximity to, handling or disposing of asbestos (eg. appropriate training and personal protective clothing such as gloves, respirators and disposal clothing are provided to carry out this work); andFinal disposal to be managed by licensed asbestos removal contractors.All other contractors are also required to provide evidence of compliance with the relevant State and Federal occupational health and safety legislation and contractors meet regularly with Telstra to review compliance with this legislation.(5)   Telstra has kept detailed records as to all asbestos related claims nationally from 2000. Since that time there have been 10 claims where asbestosis was alleged to have developed from exposure to asbestos during the employ of Telstra's predecessors.</DOC>

The Lieutenant-Commander's parents referred to the incident in their letter of that date, which covered a range of issues including reference to the alleged rape.On 11 December 2000, Rear Admiral Hancock held the rank of Captain, and the position of Senior Staff Officer to the Chief of Navy. In that role, and at about that date, he met the parents of the Lieutenant-Commander. The subject of the meeting is not recalled.Defence did refer the rape allegation to the AFP. Defence has not located any formal report and is not aware of any formal report concerning the alleged incident ever being made by the Lieutenant-Commander. It was on this basis that the Minister was advised that the alleged incident was not reported to Defence. Correspondence from her parents to the then Chief of Navy in late 2000 identified that the alleged incident, as well as a number of other matters '_occurred during the 1st semester of 1986'. Subsequent correspondence between Navy and the Lieutenant-Commander and her parents was unable to elicit a report by the Lieutenant-Commander on this incident, but did cause Defence to decide that the AFP should be advised of the matter and this step was taken by letter dated 5 April 2001. The Minister regrets if there was any confusion arising out of his answer.Defence paid an amount of $384,320.86 for legal and related costs associated with Dr McKenzie.The HREOC conciliation proceedings were confidential; it is not appropriate to refer to what was or was not proposed by anyone present.Yes.The costs of Phillips Fox attendance at the meeting were $1,380.Yes.That is not a matter known to Defence.Defence was not a party at the hearings and is not aware of what submissions were put on Dr McKenzie's behalf, or the effect on the Board of any submissions.Defence's Director of Litigation determined that a portion of the Board's legal costs should be met, in accordance with the Legal Service Directions.A civilian lawyer, who is a Navy Reserve Legal Officer, provided legal assistance to the Lieutenant-Commander. The duration of the assistance was in excess of an hour. Defence has made no payment to that lawyer for that service.Navy Reserve Legal Officers are paid according to the form of their particular engagement and their rank, as stipulated in the Defence Determinations made pursuant to Defence Act 1903, section 58B.Yes.Yes.No.Yes; but it was not applicable in the circumstances.Yes.The basis of the firm's engagement is not known to Defence.Phillips Fox acted for Dr McKenzie after he received the Board's initial notice dated June 2002 and before the matter was called on before the Board.No.There was no decision to transfer.The Lieutenant-Commander made an FOI application on 8 December 2003 for her personal file. A full disclosure was made on 7 April 2004.No. Access to a member's personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. Dr McKenzie did not have right of access to the Lieutenant-Commander's personal file.It is not clear from the question what 'complaint' is referred to, or with whom it was lodged. Access to a member's personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. The Commanding Officer of HMAS Stirling was entitled to have access to the personal file of the Lieutenant-Commander in his role as her commanding officer.Access to a member's personal record and his/her medical record is not unfettered but is subject to the person seeking access having appropriate authority and a relevant need for access. The Lieutenant-Commander as Executive Officer did not have authority to have access to the personal file of the Commanding Officer of HMAS Stirling. The personal file of Dr McKenzie who was a Reserve member, was not held at HMAS Stirling.</DOC>

My Department provides funding to a wide variety of organisations and some of these organisations are faith-based. As part of the conditions of funding set out in funding agreements, all funded organisations are required to comply with all relevant legislation, which would include employment legislation and regulation.No.Programs funded through my Department have specific guidelines and/or performance requirements. The funding agreements between organisations and the Department require organisations to only expend funds for the purposes for which they have been given. Organisations are funded to undertake specific projects, meet specific outcomes, milestones and/or deliver specific services, also set out in the funding agreement. The purpose of the funding is also set out in the program guidelines for individual programs.Organisations funded are required to acquit funding and report on outcomes or milestones achieved or the specific services delivered as part of their funding agreement with the Department. They are also required to provide evidence, by way of independently audited financial statements, that the funding has been spent for the purposes set down in the funding agreement. Any funds expended for purposes other than those covered by the funding agreement must be refunded by the organisation.</DOC>

The Repatriation Commissioner wrote on my behalf in February 2005 to 240 ex-service organisations seeking nominations. The number of places on each mission party is limited and I seek to ensure, as far as practicable, representation from each State and Territory and each Service. My intention is to include as wide a representation of the units and formations involved in the campaigns as possible, and to reflect the rank structure and different experiences of individuals. Each nomination is carefully considered by the Department, taking account of service records, health and fitness to travel and the broad selection criteria and recommendations made to me for final decision.The Repatriation Commissioner wrote to some 240 relevant ex-service organisations of which nine were RSLs.The Department does not have a record of surviving veterans of the Borneo campaigns so it is not possible to ensure that every veteran is aware of the commemorative mission. It writes to relevant ex-service organisations that disseminate the information. Where veterans are aware of missions and nominate themselves, the nomination is considered together with ex-service organisation nominations.</DOC>

The Board of Airservices Australia considered the issue of consolidation of the Adelaide approach Terminal Control Unit (TCU) with the Melbourne air traffic control centre in August 2003. The Board further considered the matter at its November and December 2005 meetings and resolved to delay making a final decision on the TCU integration proposal for up to 12 months. The Board has indicated it needs more time to adequately examine detailed information about the rationale for the proposed integration and options in lieu of the integration proposal, as well as the potential impact on the feasibility and benefits of the integration proposal in the light of recent developments in the relationship between Airservices and the Department of Defence.The Board's 2003 decision stated that if there is to be any relocation, it would not occur before 1 September 2008.Airservices Australia has assessed the potential financial savings from relocating Air Traffic Control from Adelaide to Melbourne at $3.0 million Net Present Value over 13 years.In locations where remote TCU services have previously been relocated to a major centre, there has been no impact on safety. For example, Canberra relocated to Melbourne in 1995 and Coolangatta relocated to Brisbane in 1999. Airservices Australia advises that integration of both the Canberra and Coolangatta operations within the major centres has improved the capability to optimise the use of systems, staff resources and provided for better supervision of operations which delivers benefits to all sectors of the industry. However, Airservices recognises that technology advancements and the dynamism of the aviation environment may present options in lieu of TCU integration and will keep the matter under active consideration pending a final decision by the Board.</DOC>

Yes. In the AusLink Investment Programme provided to the New South Wales Government on 10 May 2005, funding allocations were: $14 million in 2005-06, $25 million in 2006-07, $40 million in 2007-08 and $162.7 million in 2008-09.The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) undertook a review of the cost of the project, and produced a revised cost estimate of $765 million.The AusLink White Paper released on 7 June 2004, stated that 'Further funding for the F3 to Branxton project will be sought in future budgets subject to an agreement being reached with the New South Wales Government on funding shares as part of the state funding agreement.' However, speculation about the final Australian Government contribution to the project would be premature. The RTA is currently reviewing the project in conjunction with the Department of Transport and Regional Services. This will be the subject of further advice to the New South Wales and Australian Governments.The NSW Government signed the AusLink bilateral agreement on 29 September 2005.</DOC>

This information is available in a range of publicly available documents, including budget documents and annual reports.Funding programs which include the condition that employees be given the option of the offer of an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA) are:higher education providers under the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements (HEWRRs). Institutions are required to offer AWAs to all new employees employed after 29 April 2005 and to all other employees by 31 August 2006. Until 30 June 2006, institutions are exempt from offering AWAs to casual employees engaged for a period of less than one month. The HEWRRs are provided for in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Act 2005 and the relevant guidelines;Australian Technical Colleges under the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Act 2005; andTAFE institutions  - the Skilling Australia's Workforce Act 2005 provides for financial assistance to the States and to other persons for vocational education and training. In order to be eligible for funding, States must implement workplace reforms in the vocational education and training sector, including ensuring that TAFE institutions introduce more flexible employment arrangements by offering AWAs to staff, except where making such agreements under the Workplace. Relations Act 1996 is not possible because of the corporate status of the TAFE institution, in which case other individual agreements should be offered.I am not aware of any other funding agreements which require applicants to offer AWAs.</DOC>

Yes.Yes, with the exception of telephone allowance, which is paid on the basis of one telephone subscriber per household, pharmaceutical allowance, which is paid on a family basis and utilities allowance, which is paid on a household basis.The individual partnered pension rate is 83 per cent of the single rate. Additional allowances are paid on a household basis. Rent assistance has been structured so that a single person or a family pays on average the same percentage of the household income in rent.The pension structure does not provide a disincentive to marriage because a couple who live in a marriage-like relationship are treated in the same way as a married couple.No, as it is appropriate that the individual partnered rate is less than the single rate. Members of a couple enjoy economies in their domestic circumstances.</DOC>

Yes. The Social Security Act 1991(the Act) requires the Secretary (or Delegate) to determine whether a person is single or a member of a couple in order to calculate the rate of pension or allowance that is payable. A person who is in a marriage-like relationship is treated the same as a person who is legally married.and (3) The social security system recognises that single people need more income to have a similar standard of living to couples. The rates of pension, allowance, rent assistance, pharmaceutical allowance, remote area allowance and telephone allowance are all affected by a person's status as a single person or as a member of a couple.Under the Social Security Act 1991, the existence of a marriage-like relationship (whether a couple is legally married or not) is considered in determining whether a person is a member of a couple. There is no disincentive to marriage.See (4). There is no disincentive to marriage.</DOC>

I am aware of the September 2005 statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding the return of persons to Iraq. The Commissioner has requested that States continue to postpone schemes to promote or induce returns for persons originating from Southern or Central Iraq but has said that the voluntary return of Iraqis originating from the three Northern Governorates could be considered, provided they have family and community links that can ensure their access to protection, housing and other basic services.and (3) Because of the ongoing situation in Iraq, and the advice of UNHCR, the Government is not enforcing returns to Iraq. This includes not promoting voluntary reintegration assistance packages to Iraqis, although these are available on request by individuals who wish to voluntarily return. If a person requests Australia's assistance to return to Iraq they are given a copy of the latest UNHCR advice so that they can make an informed decision.</DOC>

Yes, though the commitment was made on 11 July 2004; not in June 2004.Creating a new medal is a lengthy process. From the time a medal is announced, it goes through an extensive process before it is issued. This includes Royal approval, consultation on eligibility and design, formal approval, tendering for manufacture, testing and manufacturing the medal before it is issued. The Request for Tender for the manufacture of the Australian Defence Medal was released on 20 October 2005.The Government continues to honour all members of the Australian Defence Force, both past and present. The Government will begin issuing the medal when the medal has been manufactured and applicants for the medal have been assessed as eligible. The medal is expected to be available in the first half of 2006, subject to manufacturing lead times.</DOC>

I am not aware of any such reports.The Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act) is the Commonwealth legislation that generally regulates business transactions and provides protection for Australian consumers in a range of areas. Although there are no provisions under the Act that deal specifically with profiteering from incidents such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, the Act does prohibit the misuse of market power and therefore provides a mechanism for dealing with anti-competitive conduct.Airfare prices are set by airlines and are commercial decisions for the individual companies. Although it is not the role of the Australian Government to control or limit the commercial decisions of the business community, the Government does expect that Australian companies will act ethically and not take advantage of people in traumatic circumstances caused by terrorist attacks or natural disasters.</DOC>

The Government is investing a further $266.4 million in child care through a suite of child care measures that will support the Government's Welfare to Work changes, including nearly 88,000 new places for Outside School Hours Care (OSHC), Family Day Care (FDC) and In-Home care. The additional places are expected to meet demand.The Government provided an additional 84,300 Outside School Hours Care places, 2,500 Family Day Care places and 1,000 In-Home Care places over a four year period in the 2005-06 Budget. There is no limit on the number of long day care centre places that may be approved. The initial allocation of the over 17,000 Outside School Hours Care places occurred in November 2005. All confirmed demand was met.The Minister is not aware of any studies that show increases in child care fees a contributing factor to parents not participating in the workforce.The Australian Government provides support to families to assist with the cost of child care. All families who use approved child care are eligible to receive assistance in the form of Child Care Benefit (CCB). CCB is means tested and low income families receive the highest rate of CCB. CCB covers two thirds of the cost of care for low income families. CCB has a part time loading, in recognition that part time fees are sometimes more expensive than full time fees. In addition the Child Care Tax Rebate will provide working families with up to $4000 per child per year additional assistance for out of pocket costs per child. Furthermore, parents benefit socially and economically over the longer term from participating in the workforce.The Howard Government introduced the Child Care Tax Rebate (CCTR), which benefits working families using care from 1 July 2004. Further questions on tax issues should be directed to the Treasurer.</DOC>

Yes. Evans-Smith and Dando Pty Ltd were engaged by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to write the 2005 - 06 edition of Making it Easier to Comply, an annual corporate publication that reports to the community on the ATO's progress and plans under its easier, cheaper and more personalised program. The total cost for the services was $11,616 (GST inclusive).It was considered necessary to engage an outside company to write this material because the ATO did not have sufficient available resources with the necessary specialised skills to undertake the work in the required timeframe.</DOC>

The development of food regulation policy, including labelling of food and drink, is a shared responsibility between the Ministers of the Australian Government, the states, territories and New Zealand.The Australian Government therefore can not unilaterally change food labelling and other food regulations.The mechanism for developing food policy guidelines that guide food standards development is undertaken by the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council. Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) undertakes the development of food standards.FSANZ has assessed a number of applications to review the situation regarding health warning labels on alcohol beverages. The reasons for FSANZ rejecting the applications include that:studies on the effectiveness of warning statements on alcohol beverages have shown that while they may increase awareness, the increased awareness does not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. The evidence even indicated that warning statements may result in an increase in the undesirable behaviour of 'at risk' groups;existing labelling requirements and public health programs and campaigns already provide information to enable consumers to make informed decisions about alcohol intake and prevent deception about the nature of the product;there has been a reduction in consumption and alcohol-related harm in Australia (between 1990 and 1997); andlabels would be difficult to devise given the complexity of issues surrounding the use and misuse of alcohol, and the known benefits of moderate alcohol consumption.The full FSANZ assessment report and regulation impact assessment for FSANZ application number A359 is located at http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/A359_Full_Assessment.pdf.</DOC>

Yes, I am aware of the case referred to and of the terms of the settlement agreed to by the CEO of Customs and Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd and Lorene Khamis.The decision handed down by Justice Rothman imposed:- penalties totalling $1,725,000 on the first defendant (Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd); and- Penalties totalling $1,512,000 on the second defendant (Lorene Khamis).The settlement sum agreed to by the CEO of Customs was $255,805.34 in full and final satisfaction of the judgement sum. The settlement terms also required the defendants to pay the legal costs incurred by Customs in this matter. In reaching this settlement, Customs accepted legal advice that a settlement involving guilty pleas and recovery of duty was the best available outcome given the complexity of the case and the lack of capacity for the defendants to pay the judgement sum. This settlement resulted in convictions against the Customs offences and guaranteed the recovery of duty owing to the Commonwealth, without incurring substantial additional costs to the taxpayer.Yes, I have viewed a copy of the advertisement referred to and have noted the claims made in this advertisement.I have been advised that Customs are assessing whether there is cause to review the accuracy of the claims of impecuniosity made in the defendants affidavit.The Customs offences involved in this case have been before the courts and the outcome is outlined in the answer provided at 2 a) and b) above.The illegal conduct referred to has been dealt with by the courts, as outlined in the answer to Question 2.</DOC>

According to the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) data, for September 2005, the proportion of employed persons who worked:Less than five hours per week was 8.6 per cent;Between five and ten hours per week was 5.7 per cent;Between 11 and 20 hours per week was 9.9 per cent;Between 21 and 30 hours per week was 10.8 per cent;Between 31 and 40 hours per week was 34.8 per cent; and41 hours and over per week was 30.2 per cent.My Department does not have hours data worked for each member country of the OECD. Accordingly, this matter should be referred to the ABS for further consideration.The official measure of employment is compiled by the ABS from their monthly Labour Force Survey. In general terms, to be defined as employed, a survey respondent must have:Worked for one hour or more in the reference week for pay or profit, or for one hour or more without pay in a family business or on a farm; orHad a job, but were not at work in the week they were surveyed for one of a number of specific reasons (such as being on leave, on strike or locked out, stood down or away from work because of shift arrangements).This definition closely follows International Labour Organisation (ILO) guidelines, and has been essentially unchanged since the national Labour Force Survey was first undertaken in 1964.(4)   The majority of OECD countries also have definitions of employment that closely follow ILO guidelines and, accordingly, are comparable with the definition used by the ABS (ie, that persons who work for one hour or more, or who have a job but are away from work for one of a number of specific reasons, are classified as employed). The countries that have a definition of employment comparable with Australia's on which my Department has information are: Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The United States of America and Korea also have very similar definitions, but only classify unpaid family workers as employed if they work for 15 hours or more or 18 hours or more, respectively. It should be noted that unpaid family workers only comprise 0.001 per cent of total employment in the United States of America. Accordingly, this difference in definition will not have any significant impact on any international comparison.(5)   (a)   As noted above, most of the countries listed below have a definition of employment that is comparable with (or in the case of the United States and Korea, very similar to) that used in Australia (ie, that persons who work for one hour or more, or who have a job but are away from work for one of a number of specific reasons, are considered employed). My Department does not, however, have information on the definition of employment used in France.(b)   The latest available data on unemployment rates for the following OECD countries (for 2004) has been extracted from the 2005 OECD Employment Outlook:New Zealand  -  4.0 per cent;the USA  -  5.6 per cent;Canada  -  7.2 per cent;the United Kingdom  -  4.7 per cent;Germany  -  9.9 per cent;France  -  9.6 per cent;Sweden  -  6.6 per cent;Norway  -  4.5 per cent;Denmark  -  5.3 per cent;Netherlands  -  4.7 per cent;Italy  -  8.1 per cent;Japan  -  4.9 per cent; andKorea  -  3.6 per cent.</DOC>

Yes. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) engaged the services of Livingstones Australia Brisbane on a consultancy basis to undertake an administrative investigation.The purpose of the investigation was to look into allegations and counter-allegations of harassment between two ATO employees.The engagement of their services was necessary because the allegations have a history of several years and efforts to resolve the issue informally by senior management and human resource operatives have not been successful. The issues are complex and legal representatives are involved in the process. Because of this, and to provide impartiality, an external investigator was considered necessary.The results of the investigation will not be made public, but will be considered by a senior ATO delegate. The report will form the basis for any further appropriate administrative action considered necessary.</DOC>

Questacon  -  The National Science and Technology Centre, part of the Department of Education, Science and Training, did engage SX Trailers Pty at a cost of $86 100, the price of a new semi-trailer.This was necessary to replace a trailer used by the travelling Shell Questacon Science Circus that had become unserviceable and unsafe due to age, corrosion and mechanical failure. The original trailer was designed and manufactured in 1987.A custom-built trailer is essential for the transport, storage and promotion of a national touring programme known as the Shell Questacon Science Circus. The new trailer was purchased after investigating alternatives such as repairing the old trailer or leasing a general purpose transporter.A range of quotations was sought and assessed before choosing SX Trailers Pty as the supplier. The new vehicle enables Questacon, on behalf of the Australian Government, to provide a science education outreach programme to Australian rural, regional and remote communities.</DOC>

Yes. The Minister notes that the child care CPI does not reflect the significant benefits of the Child Care Tax Rebate (CCTR), which will deliver additional assistance of around $1 billion over the four years to 2008 - 09. The CCTR is not taken into account because taxation assistance is outside the scope of the CPI.Child care fees are not regulated by the Australian Government and are business decisions made by child care services. The Australian Government provides assistance to families through Child Care Benefit which is indexed to the CPI and the CCTR  -  a 30 per cent tax rebate of up to $4,000 per child, per year on out of pocket child care costs.No.No.Yes. Parents entering the workforce will be supported with a range of employment options which they may consider.Since 2004, the Government has met in full the confirmed demand for places from family day care and outside school hours care services. The Government has no limits on the number of long day care centres or long day care centre places that may be approved for the purposes of Child Care Benefit.and (b) Under the Howard Government, child care places have doubled to 600,000 compared to 306,000 in 1996. In successive Budgets in 2004 and 2005 the Government has made provision for a total additional 124,300 Outside School Hours Care places and 6,500 Family Day Care places to 2008-09. The government allocated over 17,000 Outside School Hours Care Places to services in November, meeting all confirmed demand. There are no limits on the availability of long day care centre places.All levels of government have a role in child care. The Australian Government has had discussion on planning, including land and approvals with the Local Government and Planning Minister and the Australian Local Government Association.The Department is currently examining options to increase flexibility of Family Day Care, including in inner city areas, to provide extra choice for families.</DOC>

to (3) On 12 November 2005 the Prime Minister, the Honourable John Howard MP, announced that the Australian Government will allocate $320 million of the AusLink Brisbane Urban funding to upgrading the existing Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway. The total Australian Government funding now allocated to improving the Ipswich Motorway corridor is $556 million.The independent feasibility study of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option identified three potentially feasible alignments and estimated construction costs of between $820 million and $1,137 million. These options require further investigation and planning. The study concluded that the existing Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway must be upgraded irrespective of the approach adopted for the Dinmore to Goodna section. The 12 November 2005 announcement by the Prime Minister recognises these findings.The Queensland Government's estimate of the cost of upgrading the existing Ipswich Motorway could be up to $1,098 million in 2005 dollars. I understand that this estimate has been confirmed by engineering consultants, Maunsell Australia. The Queensland Government has completed planning only and estimates that construction would take three years minimum using Design and Construction (D&amp;C) procurement methods.Further geotechnical and environmental investigation and planning is required. The Prime Minister announced on 12 November 2005 an additional $10 million of AusLink funding for investigation and planning of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option between Dinmore and Gailes. It is likely that this will take a minimum of two and one half years. I understand that it is possible that construction could be completed in a further three and one half years using contractor alliances and concurrent planning.Until such time as the further investigations referred to in (6) are concluded, it would not be appropriate to compare claimed costs for what may prove to be non-compatible (due to route choice, engineering solutions etc) potential projects.Funding has now been provided so that the Wacol to Darra section of Ipswich Motorway can be upgraded without delay and further investigation and planning of the Ipswich Motorway Northern Option can proceed.</DOC>

The Saturday respite service program has ceased because it was unsuccessful in the National Respite for Carers Program (NRCP) Request for Application (RFA) process.NRCP funding is not allocated through competitive tendering processes. The NRCP is a grant program and the usual method for allocating funds is through competitive application processes.The RFA process for the NRCP was advertised nationally on 5 March 2005. Applications closed on 1 April 2005. There is no minimum time requirement for grant processes, but the four weeks allowed was more than the 25 day requirement for competitive tender processes. Organisations had been advised in January 2005 of the government's intention to conduct a competitive application process.to (7) A separate estimate of the availability of respite on any particular day is not available because a significant proportion of respite availability is for flexible care that is used on different days of the week depending on the requirements of individual carers. In addition, the Carers ACT Commonwealth Carer Respite Centre (CCRC) brokered respite for carers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) according to assessed relative need.Notes to parts (4) to (7):Answers reflect that assessments for funding under the RFA were made on the basis of assessed priorities within Home and Community Care (HACC) regions. The ACT is one HACC region. In the ACT, services commonly have a territory-wide catchment area and it is not possible to quantify carer uptake of services within specific electoral boundaries, nor postcode areas.Services are not approved on the basis of 'places', rather carer numbers and hours of respite provided are used.In the ACT, all 6 carers who were receiving respite from services unsuccessful in the RFA that ceased operating from 30 September 2005, are continuing to receive respite.Organisations that were unsuccessful in receiving continuing NRCP funding received transitional funding until 30 September 2005. They were provided with information about alternative services for carers. It was up to individual carers whether or not they chose to accept alternative respite.</DOC>

The proportion of businesses with less than 20 employees that had their pay set by awards was 27.5 per cent at May 20041.. For businesses with 20 to 99 employees the proportion that had their pay set by awards was slightly higher at 31.2 per cent2. Therefore, the majority of small businesses with less than 100 employees have their pay set by agreements rather than awards.Under the Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Bill 2005 (the Bill), minimum and award classification wages will be set and adjusted by the Australian Fair Pay Commission (the Fair Pay Commission). These wages will form the basis of the wage guarantee in the new Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (the Standard). Under the Standard, no employee who signs an agreement can be paid less than their relevant classification wage. Employees who remain award-reliant will continue to be paid their classification wage.        The wage and classification details published by the Fair Pay Commission will have sufficient information for small business employers and employees to be able to determine the appropriate classification wage for their employees.The Bill is designed to provide people with the choice of remaining under the award system or entering into a workplace agreement which tailors working arrangements to their particular needs and circumstances. In respect of workplace agreements, protection is provided through both the Standard and a number of protected award conditions.The Australian Government will enshrine in federal legislation, a number of key employment conditions: annual leave, personal/carer's leave (including sick leave), parental leave (including maternity leave) and maximum ordinary hours of work. These conditions, together with basic rates of pay and casual loadings set by the Fair Pay Commission, will comprise the Standard. All new agreements will need to meet the Standard throughout the life of the agreement.In addition, the Bill will protect certain award conditions when new workplace agreements are negotiated. These award conditions are: public holidays, rest breaks (including meal breaks), incentive-based payments and bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime loadings. Employers and employees will continue to be able to vary these protected entitlement's arrangements by agreement, as they can under the current system. However these specific award conditions can only be modified or removed by specific provisions in a new agreement.It is the Australian Government's intention to provide certainty and clarity for employees and employers wishing to negotiate an agreement. In particular, any changes made to these protected conditions in agreements must be clearly identified so that the employees affected are aware of the modifications to their entitlements. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

The purpose of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the service delivery of Crisis Payment.The report found that Crisis Payment was considered to be a valuable payment by both the community and the Centrelink network but that there was scope to streamline administration and better meet individual needs and community expectations.There was no discussion of the cessation of Crisis Payment.The review was an internal Centrelink review and there are no plans for the Minister of Family and Community Services to table this review.There are more men than women granted Crisis Payment primarily because there are more male prisoners in Australia. The majority of Crisis Payments are granted to people on release from prison. In 2004-05 there were 45,804 Crisis Payments granted, of which 25,476 were granted to newly released male prisoners in comparison to 3,098 granted to newly released female prisoners.Crisis Payment can be claimed where a person is in severe financial hardship and an extreme circumstance has forced their departure from their home, or on release from gaol or psychiatric confinement.Centrelink is unable to extract Crisis Payment data for the 2000/2001 financial years at this time. The data was recorded and stored in a different manner to subsequent years.Total Crisis Payments made in the remaining four financial years are as follows:2001/2002 = 43,9712002/2003 = 45,2822003/2004 = 44,8472004/2005 = 45,804The requested data for four financial years is listed in Attachment A.Crisis Payment is marketed through a number of channels including:On the Centrelink website;In refuges, that is, equipping refuge workers with the necessary information to refer customers to claim a Crisis Payment;Welfare and Education areas in prison or psychiatric confinements;Department of Family and Community Services Website;Welfare Right websites;Centrelink brochures and booklets (i.e. Are you in Crisis or Needing Special Help life event booklet); andAustralian Services for Regional Australia website.74 crisis payments were made available to alleged and actual perpetrators of domestic violence.Currently only victims of domestic violence who leave their family home and establish a new home are eligible for Crisis Payment. Section 1061JH(1) subsection (c) of the SSAct states that a person is qualified for a Crisis Payment if the person has established or intends to establish a new home. They are not able to access other social security payments in addition to their pension or allowance. Paying Crisis Payment to a perpetrator is also of benefit to the victim as it assists with the relocation of the perpetrator away from the family home.</DOC>

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) engaged the services of mpconsulting in November 2004 to provide advice to the TGA on the most appropriate means for improving consumer and professional access to web based copies of up-to-date Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) and Product Information (PI) documents.Following an initial exploration of some of the issues, mpconsulting prepared an Initial Discussion Paper in April 2005 to provide a basis for scoping further discussions with stakeholders. The Initial Discussion Paper Improving access to prescription medicines information is available on the TGA website available at: http://www.tga.gov.au/consult/index.htm and was subject to a period of consultation. The responses from that consultation are being considered and further work is to be undertaken on this issue.The CMI scheme provides a payment to pharmacists to assist them to meet additional costs associated with printing and explaining CMIs. Pharmacists are required to certify every two months that they have provided CMIs in accordance with the provisions of the CMI scheme.All prescription medicines must be supplied with a CMI document and the TGA reviews CMI documents as part of its evaluation process. The Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 set out the requirements CMI documents must meet and if assessors believe that CMI documents do not meet these they are 'sent back'. CMI documents must also be consistent with the PI document for health professionals and therefore are regularly reviewed when changes to the PI document are made.An evaluation of the CMI scheme was undertaken by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) under contract to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The TNS evaluation showed that in April 2004, 47% of consumers who had a prescription filled in the previous six months were aware of CMIs, compared with 41 per cent who were aware of the program in July 2003.The main objectives of the CMI scheme are to promote the quality use of medicines and assist consumers to make informed decisions.The TNS evaluation showed that the majority of participating pharmacists are better equipped and more focused on providing their customers with CMIs.The evaluation report also showed that since the commencement of the CMI scheme, around 90% of consumers who were surveyed reported greater knowledge of the possible side effects and interactions of their medications.The Pharmacy Guild promoted the CMI scheme in pharmacies in September and November 2002. Promotion to consumers included the provision of posters and cards displayed on pharmacy counters. Promotion to pharmacists included distribution of registration forms and program guidelines. A total of $42,618 (excluding GST) was spent on this promotion, for approximately 5,000 pharmacies.In June 2005, the Australian Government funded the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to organise the 'Ask Your Pharmacist Week' information program. One of the aims of the program was to raise awareness of CMI. Key activities included raising public awareness and demand for CMI, and the development of new pharmacy and consumer CMI promotion materials. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia spent a total of $668,490 (excluding GST) on the 'Ask Your Pharmacist Week' information program.The Australian Government funded National Prescribing Service promotes awareness of CMI through its Community Quality Use of Medicines Program. It is not possible to provide a specific expenditure figure for the CMI awareness activities undertaken as part of this program.Yes.The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) Pharmacy Practice Handbook 2000 states, in part, that 'CMI may be offered to the patient each time a product is dispensed. Whether this is appropriate is a matter for professional judgement. Specific circumstances where CMI should be provided include when a medicine is first provided to the patient.'The TGA does not formally monitor this process.See part (3).</DOC>

At El Alamein during World War II.Anti-vehicle mines have legitimate military utility as obstacles to deny enemy mobility. Individual mines and minefields achieve this through a combination of physical effects that impede movement by slowing, obstructing, immobilising or destroying the target, and the psychological effect of fear and uncertainty experienced by an adversary encountering or attempting to negotiate the obstacle. Historical evidence of the military utility of anti-vehicle mines is extensive and includes examples from World War II and, more recently, the 1991 Gulf War.Australia does not support a global ban on anti-vehicle mines but, instead, supports global restrictions on such mines that ensure that they are detectable by commonly available mine detection equipment, and that remotely deployable anti-vehicle mines are engineered to self-destruct/self-neutralise and self-deactivate within a set time frame.Anti-handling devices provide a legitimate means of preventing enemy forces deliberately interfering with anti-vehicle mines which, if not protected, might subsequently be used by those forces.Australia does not support a global ban on anti-vehicle mines, or a ban on anti-vehicle mines that are not command detonated. Australia's position is that anti-vehicle mines have legitimate military utility and that humanitarian concerns, including those posed by persistent anti-vehicle mines which remain active after the cessation of conflict, are best addressed through technical restrictions of the type proposed in the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention Experts' Group Meetings.</DOC>

The Australian Government does not limit the number of LDC places or services.The Minister acknowledged that there are areas of need in inner city areas due to land availability and prices, and has called on both state and local government to factor in child care in planning.Refer to answer to question (1)., (b) and (c) The Department regularly advises the Minister's office on various aspects of child care on the basis of information that is available.No.The Australian Government does not restrict the number of new long day care centres that can be established. The Minister has recently announced a trial of innovative flexible Family Day Care and extended an invitation to the City of Port Phillip, in inner city Melbourne, to participate in the initial pilot. The Minister also tabled a paper at the State and Territory Local Government Ministers Council and has written to the Australian Local Government Association to discuss how all levels of government can play a role in planning and identifying land.State and local governments have a role in licensing and planning and in ensuring that land is available for the provision of child care services. The Australian Government does not build child care centres and does not directly provide child care. There are no restrictions on the number of new long day care centres that may be established, or the number of places.The Minister has written to all levels of government and planning ministers encouraging them to work together to improve access to child care and facilitate the development of child care centres through local planning mechanisms.The Long Day Care Incentive Scheme was specifically established to target demand in rural and urban fringe areas. The incentive funding ensures services remain viable while they build their client base and utilization rates to sustainable levels.Assistance is targeted at rural and remote areas who have no child care services available.The Government has no involvement in fees charged by LDC operators.No.</DOC>

Each state and territory has responsibility for the licensing and regulation of children's services within its jurisdiction, which includes qualifications of workers. The Australian Government has no responsibility for monitoring requirements of State and Territory regulatory systems.State and Territory governments are responsible for the licensing and regulation of Family Day Care services. National standards have been developed to provide the basis for a uniform national approach to the licensing of Family Day Care. To be approved for child care benefit a Family Day Care (FDC) scheme must register with the Australian Government National Childcare Accreditation Council (NCAC) to participate in Family Day Care Quality Assurance (FDCQA).There was a small decrease in the number of children attending FDC from 2002-2004 according to the 2004 Census of Child Care Services; (a) the decrease can be partly attributed to the timing of the 2004 Census. The 2004 Census was held close to the commencement of the school holiday period whereas the 2002 Census was conducted mid-term resulting in a drop in child numbers; (b) There is no indication of this.and (b)This information is not collected by the department. The Australian Government does not regulate rates that a carer can charge, although the charge per hour of care provided is often regulated by individual FDC schemes. A carer's income is directly dependent on the number of children in their care and the number of hours for which they charge for care., (b) and (c) As announced in the 2005 Budget, the first of these places will be allocated from July 2006.</DOC>

The Department does not have definitions for the terms 'nanny' or 'au pair'. No distinction is made between the two terms for the purposes of funding Child Care Benefit (CCB) for registered care.The Department does not break down this information on registered carers.Registered carers, which may include nannies, are required to be over the age of 18 years, comply with all state and territory child care laws, provide receipts for care and provide a statement that they have either a Tax File Number (TFN) or a TFN exemption.See answer Question 2.No.No. (b) No.The Department does not collect this information.It is not the role of the Department to review or analyse the information provided to the Standing Committee.It is not the role of the Department to comment on the accuracy of the evidence provided to the Standing Committee.It is not the role of the Department to review or analyse the information provided to the Standing Committee.The Child Care Tax Rebate is the responsibility of the Treasurer.(a) (b) and (c) No.No.The Department has an interest in all types of early childhood care. However, its focus is on supporting parents to access approved, quality child care.One letter was received from a nanny agency requesting a meeting about the provision of in-home care and another from an agency requesting additional assistance for families using nannies.Nannies can register as carers for the purpose of Child Care Benefit. However, families using registered care are not eligible to claim the Child Care Tax Rebate.'Au pairs' can be eligible to become a 'registered carer' which entitles families to claim the minimum rate of Child Care Benefit. The Department does not break down information on registered care.Currently under the Working Holiday Scheme class of visa, 'au pairs' can stay in Australia for 12 months, however, they can only work for three months during that period.

The average Long Day Care (LDC) fee used in the graph on page 116 of the 2004-05 Department of Family and Community Service Annual Report is $209 per week. It is based on the fee(s) for 50 hours of care returned by LDC services in the 2004 Census of Child Care Services.'Weekly disposable income' refers to the amount of residual income (including non-child care government benefits such as income support payments, Family Tax Benefit (Part A and Part B), after taking out income tax and Medicare levy. For the purpose of this modelling we use dual income families with 1 child in LDC for 50 hours per week and family income split of 60:40. The family income of $33,000 was used to represent family with income close to CCB lower income threshold ($32,485pa) and $45,000 was used to represent family with income close to Female Total Average Earnings ($45,017) (FTAWE).There are two weekly child care fee figures used in producing the graph on page 116 of the 2004-05 annual report. The first is the average fee, as explained under the answer for question (1), and the second is the gap fee. The gap fee is the difference between the average fee and the CCB entitlement at the corresponding time for the family type listed above.Yes.The average number of children per family using approved child care is 1.4 child per family. This is based on Centrelink Administrative data, December 2004. Across all LDC service types, data from the 2004 Census of Child Care Services shows that only three per cent of children are in full-time care of 50 hours or more per week.</DOC>

DSUPS is an additional payment made to carers in Family Day Care (FDC) and In-Home Care (IHC) (only) who care for children with ongoing high support needs including children with a disability, in recognition of the additional care and attention that such children require.The amount of DSUPS paid to the carer is calculated on the level of additional care and attention required to care for a child with ongoing high support needs including children with a disability.The SNSS payment is available to children who have an ongoing need for a high level of support in the child care environment. Children with ongoing high support needs include children with diagnosed disabilities; children undergoing continuing assessment for disabilities or developmental delay; or refugee children who have been subjected to torture or trauma.SNSS is paid to child care service. SNSS support can provide an extra worker to support staff by increasing the staff child ratio, relief for staff/carers to attend specialist training related to the child with ongoing high support needs, or specialist equipment.A DSUPS claim for IHC can be higher than a FDC claim. Carers are paid up to 100% of the total hourly fee charged for Child Care Benefit (CCB) hours. For FDC this can mean up to around $3-$4 per hour but for IHC it can mean up to around $7-$20 per hour.The hourly rate for a SNSS worker is $14.82. There is also an allowance of $1,000 per child for specialist equipment.The approximate number of children in receipt of DSUPS in 2002-03 is not unavailable, in 2003-04 there were approximately1235 children and in 2004-05 there were approximately 1147 children in receipt of DSUPS.The approximate number of children in receipt of SNSS in 2002-03 were 3891 children, in 2003-04 there were approximately 5182 children and in 2004-05 there were approximately 5570 children in receipt of SNSS.Yes, ISS will increase the wages of home-based carers.No, these payments are made to carers and child care services  -  not parentsand (b) This information is not provided to the department by services as service participation in DSUPS and SNSS is voluntary, and based on the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.The Australian Government is committed to assisting child care services to provide the best quality care for all children through the Inclusion and Professional Support Program (IPSP). This is a significant investment in the capacity of child care workers that will ultimately benefit all Australian families, particularly families who have special care needs.

Yes  -  see attached copy of terms of reference for planning advisory committees.Yes.The last three times the planning advisory committees met were:NSW: 31 July 2003, 6 May 2004 and 22 September 2005.VIC: 16 October 2003, 4 May 2004 (by correspondence) and 13 September 2005.QLD: 7 November 2002, 28 April 2004 and 15 September 2005.SA: 13 March 2003, 5 May 2004 and 27 September 2005.WA: 28 November 2002, 29 April 2004 and 14 September 2005.TAS: 26 April 2004, 8 November 2004 and 21 September 2005.NT: 20 August 2003 (by teleconference), 28 April 2004 and 15 August 2005ACT: 27 November 2000, 6 June 2001 and 21 August 2003.and (ii) There is no limit on the availability of long day care places and therefore no requirement for planning advisory committees to advise on areas requiring more long day care places. Consequently planning advisory committees focus primarily on advising on areas that require additional Outside School Hours Care places and Family Day Care places, which are limited by the Australian Government.PLANNING ADVISORY COMMITTEESTERMS OF REFERENCEINTRODUCTIONThe child care planning system is designed to ensure that child care places are allocated in areas where they are most needed. Planning Advisory Committees (PACs) have been established in each State and Territory to provide expert advice on the need for child care in different areas. PACs' advice forms the basis of Departmental determinations of areas where child care places of different types may be allocated.LEGISLATIVE BASISThe Family Assistance legislation, A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 provides generally for the approval of child care services. Section 206 of the legislation provides that the Minister may determine guidelines about the:procedures relating to the allocation of child care places to approved child care services;matters to be taken into account in working out the number (if any) of child care places to be allocated to approved child care services;the maximum number of places that can be allocated to approved child care services in a specified class; andany other matters to be taken into account in making such an allocation.In accordance with section 206, the Minister for Family and Community Services made the Child Care Benefit (Allocation of Child Care Places) Determination 2000 on 26 June 2000.This determination details the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services in allocating places to approved child care services.Subsection 7.1 of the determination provides that, before allocating any places to approved child care services, the Secretary must determine in writing:the areas of Australia in which child care places may be allocated;the number of child care places of each kind (approved family day care services, approved occasional care services, approved outside school hours services and approved in-home care services) which may be allocated in each of those areas.Subsection 7.2 provides that a determination under subsection 1 may also divide the number of child care places determined by the Secretary as available for allocation in a particular area into:numbers of places which may be allocated in respect of children in particular age groups; andfor outside school hours care services, numbers of places which may be allocated in respect of before school care, after school care, and vacation care.Subsection 3 provides that, before making the determination under subsection 1, the Secretary shall take into account the following matters:the relative needs of different areas of Australia for the kinds of child care places to be allocated; andthe relative child care needs of people in each area who have work, training or study commitments.THE ROLE OF PACsThe role of the PACs is to assist the Secretary in making determinations under the Child Care Benefit (Allocation of Child Care Places) Determination 2000 by providing expert independent advice on those areas of Australia that need child care places of various kinds. PACs may consider the need for all types of child care, but only make recommendations on the need for family day care and outside school hours care places for the purpose of allocation determinations.The role of the PACs is advisory. PACs have no decision-making or approval powers with regard to the actual allocation of child care places to services.To assist them to perform their role PACs will be advised by the Department about any relevant Government initiatives or policies.The Department will provide to PACs the most recent population and places, utilisation and demand data to assist them in making their recommendations.PACs usually meet once or twice a year, depending on the availability of places.PAC meetings are organised by State and Territory Office planning teams and chaired by the Department's State or Territory Manager. PACs report to the Australian Government Department of Family and Community Services.The Secretary may at any time make a determination that an area needs additional child care places. The Secretary will usually make such determinations only in response to existing services that require additional places to meet immediate needs. Determinations to establish new family day care and outside school hours care services, on the other hand, will usually be informed by PAC advice.OPERATING GUIDELINESPACs shouldIdentify areas where new family day care or outside school hours care services are required. This may include areas where existing unfunded family day care or outside school hours care services are seeking access to child care benefit.Provide advice on areas that already have an appropriate range of child care services, but which need additional family day care or outside school hours care places.Provide advice, if requested, on areas where additional long day care centre places, or other kinds of child care places, are required.Provide advice on areas where further research is needed in order to identify whether more child care places are required.Family ChoiceIn providing advice to the Department, PACs' main objective should be to help ensure that child care places are allocated where they are needed and that families requiring care for their children are able to access the kind of services they want. PACs should seek to make recommendations that meet the market demand rather than direct families into any particular form of care. Accordingly PACs would be expected to recommend that places be allocated to any area where an existing service type is operating at capacity and there is evidence of an unmet demand for additional places of that kind.PACs' advice should take into account the impact that any new places may have on existing services in an area.PAC MEMBERSEach State or Territory Manager of the Australian Government Department of Family and Community Services is responsible for the membership of their own PAC.PACs are chaired by the State or Territory Manager (or his or her representative).PACs usually include representatives from State and Local Government and from organisations representing both private and community based long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care.Representatives from other organisations, or individual experts in child care provision or planning, may be included on PACs at the discretion of the State or Territory Manager. PACs should usually have no more than 8 members, in addition to the Chair.Members who serve as representatives of governments or child care organisations (but not members who serve as individuals in their own right) may, with the prior agreement of the State or Territory Manager, bring one observer to a meeting in order to introduce an alternate member to PAC operations.PAC members are expected to add value to the planning process and as such should not depend only on the information and data provided by the Department. PAC members are encouraged to bring information from their own areas of expertise to PAC meetings, including data or local knowledge of the industry.PAC members may sometimes find themselves involved in discussions on matters in which they have a personal financial or business interest. It is important for the integrity of the PAC process that members declare any potential conflict of interest they may have and/or absent themselves from discussion on such matters.CONFIDENTIALITYThe Department recognises the sensitive nature of much of the child care data that may be compiled for consideration by PACs. With the exception of material that is already publicly available, all materials prepared by the Department to inform PAC deliberations are not intended for industry or public exposure and should be treated as confidential.Similarly, all discussion at PAC meetings should be treated as confidential. Nothing that is said at meetings should be repeated outside meetings or attributed to individual members.PAC members should note that the Senate Estimates Community Affairs Committee is entitled to access PAC minutes and that the Department has agreed to provide the Committee with copies of all meetings held after July 2004.Consistent with the requirement that discussion at PAC meetings should be treated as confidential, minutes will not include details of discussions or attribute views to individual members. Minutes should give a broad outline of matters discussed, but have a primary focus on identifying the advice provided to the Department and the rationale for that advice. Draft minutes will be made available to PAC members for comment and clearance before they are finalised.</DOC>

I am aware of the statement by the Council of Catholic School Parents NSW and ACT through the report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 29 October 2005.Decisions about curriculum content are a matter for school authorities to determine. However, it should be noted that, the new WorkChoices system will contain a number of protections for young people negotiating AWAs.First, WorkChoices will introduce a requirement that if a person is negotiating an AWA and is under the age of 18, the AWA will also have to be signed and dated by an appropriate person, such as a parent or guardian, before the AWA can be lodged. The appropriate person cannot be the employer and must be at least 18 years of age.Second, anyone negotiating an agreement of any sort will continue to be able to appoint a bargaining agent to negotiate on their behalf. An employer must recognise an appointed bargaining agent.Third, the Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA) will be able to explain the contents of agreements to employees. In doing so, the OEA will take into account the circumstances of vulnerable employees such as young people.</DOC>

RAAF AP-3C Orion aircraft are utilised on an 'as available' basis to provide aerial surveillance assistance. This support to the Pacific, which is coordinated regionally, supplements aerial surveillance patrol assistance provided by New Zealand, France and the United States. Australia's primary vehicle for maritime surveillance support to the Pacific is the Pacific Patrol Boat Program.No. Australia remains committed to providing maritime security support to the Pacific region and works closely with the Governments of New Zealand and France to ensure there is no duplication of effort in satisfying this important task.</DOC>

All patients with osteoporosis should have an adequate daily calcium intake, either from diet alone (especially dairy products) or from diet plus calcium supplementation (eg. with Caltrate).

and (2) Yes.Until the Family Relationship Centres have been established, the likely demand for these services can only be estimated from demographic and other data. However, in deciding on the location of Family Relationship Centres, I also needed to take into account accessibility across the country and the availability of other services. To ensure accessibility in a regional area, some centres will need to be located in areas of smaller population compared with centres in the cities.It is not possible to place a Family Relationship Centre in every regional city. The selected locations ensure the best spread of Family Relationship Centres across the country.Bendigo is relatively close to Family Relationship Centres to be established in Ballarat, Shepparton and Melbourne.The Government already funds a range of services to assist families in Bendigo. As well as the children's contact service, the Government also funds a regional primary dispute resolution service, family relationships counselling, family relationships education, family skills training and a conciliation service.</DOC>

This includes any land beyond the two hectares around the family home. This rule was used by successive governments to ensure that people with significant real estate assets support themselves before calling on the taxpayer for support.In limited circumstances someone with a valuable asset but no income can qualify for support through the Social Security Act's hardship provisions.</DOC>

This appointment was necessary after the grounds outlined in s71(2) of the ACA Act were established by the Registrar. The main aim of an Administrator is to restore good operational order and implement good corporate governance practices. This was for a value of $11,000 (GST inclusive).The Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations is a statutory appointment under the ACA Act. Notwithstanding this, in accordance with the ACA Act, the Registrar is employed as a public servant under the Public Service Act 1999.</DOC>

Yes, I have read the article by the member for Wentworth.No, I am unable to confirm this. To do this question justice would require a full study of the inter-government fiscal transfers that take place including a comparison of both direct grants and indirect financial assistance. That would be too expensive to justify for the purposes of answering this question. I can say however, that all revenue from the GST goes directly to the States and Territories, and is available for the State and Territory governments to use for funding such public transport systems.The Government is already involved in urban transport issues through AusLink and through the coordination mechanisms that exist under the auspices of the Australian Transport Council such as the working group on urban passenger congestion. However, the Australian Government's position is that funding urban public transport systems is fundamentally a State responsibility as these systems primarily serve and deliver localised passenger movements and localised benefits.</DOC>

Trade data for the 2005 calendar year (in both value and volume terms) will not be released by the ABS until 28 February 2006. Answers reflect data available as of 20 December 2005.Australia's goods and services exports in the 10 months to October 2005 rose by 13.9 per cent, compared with the same period in 2004. Australia's exports are on track to reach record highs in value and volumes terms in 2005. Australia's trade deficit in the 10 months to October 2005 was $16.3 billion, down from the $20.1 billion deficit in the 10 months to October 2004.The value of Australia's goods and services exports grew by 13.4 per cent in 2004 - 05 from the previous financial year. The volume of Australia's goods and services exports grew by 2.5 per cent in 2004 - 05 from the previous financial year.The value of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 3.1 per cent between 2000-01 and 2004-05. The volume of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent between 2000-01 and 2004-05. During this five-year period, Australia's goods and services exports were adversely impacted by weak regional and global demand, a marked appreciation of the Australian dollar, drought in Eastern Australia, and health and security concerns.The value of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 3.1 per cent between 2000-01 and 2004-05. The volume of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent between 2000-01 and 2004-05.The value of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 6.7 per cent between 1995-96 and 1999-00. The volume of Australia's goods and services exports grew by an average annual rate of 6.7 per cent between 1995-96 and 1999-00.Australia's export growth has fluctuated considerably over the past half century, reflecting a variety of domestic and international influences. For most of the five-year period ending in 2004 - 05, Australia's goods and services exports were adversely impacted by weak regional and global demand, a marked appreciation of the Australian dollar, drought in Eastern Australia, and health and security concerns.There is no basis for such an assertion having regard to the current record level of export values and export volumes. Growth in the volume of exports in the early part of the five year period to 2004 - 05 was lower than in previous periods since the early 1950s for the reasons outlined in question (4) above.The value of Australia's goods and services exports grew by 13.4 per cent in 2004 - 05 from the previous financial year. The volume of Australia's goods and services exports grew by 2.5 per cent in 2004 - 05 from the previous financial year.

Note: Reflecting data availability, all trade data aggregates are on a calendar year basis and for merchandise goods only. Data on trends in trade aggregates in OECD countries is not available prior to 1994.In 2004, Australia accounted for 0.94 per cent of world merchandise exports, compared to 1.10 per cent of world merchandise exports in 1994. A major contributing factor to this decline has been the increase in significance of exports from emerging economies, notably China, which has increased its share of world exports over the last decade by 3.7 percentage points. For most of the five year period ending in 2004, Australia's merchandise exports were also adversely impacted by weak regional and global demand, a marked appreciation of the Australian dollar and drought in Eastern Australia.Over the last decade, Australia's merchandise exports (in US dollars) have grown by 4.7 per cent per annum, compared with the OECD average (in US dollars) of 5.0 per cent . Over this period Australia's average export growth was greater than that of major industrialised countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan.Over the last 20 years Australia's share of world merchandise exports has declined from 1.18 per cent to 0.94 per cent. A major contributing factor to this decline has been the increase in significance of exports from emerging countries, notably China, which has increased its share of world exports over the last two decades by 5.1 percentage points.</DOC>

I am advised that there is no specific offence related to the flying of the swastika. It is possible, however, that flying the swastika in some particular circumstances may constitute an offence under a Commonwealth law.I would expect that a substantial proportion of the Australian population find Nazism and its imagery repugnant and that the flying of the swastika would be offensive to many individuals, including Jewish and migrant Australians.I am aware that the court found that the respondent had engaged in conduct which is unlawful under the Racial Discrimination Act. I am advised, however, that under the terms of the Act, this does not constitute a criminal offence.The Government has no current plans to introduce legislation of this kind. However, the honourable member may like to note that under current Commonwealth legislation there may be particular circumstances, such as displaying the swastika at a polling place or flying the swastika with seditious intent, which may already constitute an offence.</DOC>

There is a wide range of estimated incidence, most of these estimates are based on limited Australian surveys or overseas data. Variation in study methodologies, statistical variation and differences in diagnosis between clinicians are thought to be relevant factors. A recent study by Williams K, Glasson EJ, et al 'Incidence of autism spectrum disorders in children in two Australian states', in the Medical Journal of Australia 2005, reported an annual incidence of 8.2 per 10,000 children aged 0  -  14 years in New South Wales and 12.9 per 10,000 children aged 0 -14 years in Western Australia. The report was based on 1999 and 2000 data. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is currently preparing national estimates for inclusion in the revised Burden of Disease &amp; Injury in Australia report.Some reports indicate an increase in the number of cases of autism diagnosed in Australia in the late 90's and early 2000's. However, it is unclear whether there is indeed an actual increase in the incidence of the disorder or if the increase is a consequence of other factors. To assess the level and any change of incidence requires consistent epidemiological studies.The Australian Government provides funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council for a wide range of research projects relating to mental health and neuroscience. Between 2000 and 2005, $3,653,386 was spent on research on autism spectrum disorders and related disorders.The Australian Government assistance for those with autism and their carers is provided through the government's mainstream health, welfare, education and financial assistance programs. For example, assistance is available through Medicare attendance items, which can be used for the treatment of autism by medical practitioners.The provision of early intervention and education services in relation to autism is the responsibility of state and territory governments. Their disability, health and education programs have components that include the care, treatment and education of those with autism.The Australian Government provides through the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement a Specific Purpose Payment to the states and territories to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities  -  $2.82 billion for the 5 years of the current agreement. The Department of Family and Community Services also provides specific funding to support children with autism; this has included $220,000 to Autism Queensland, $990,000 to Autism Spectrum Australia and approximately $192,000 to the University of Queensland to assist young children with autism and early intervention programs.A National Autism Forum held in Canberra in June 2005, was organised by the Department of Health and Ageing. The Forum, attended by major autism stakeholders, including state and national autism organisations, the Australian and the State and Territory Governments and consumers and carers, provided an opportunity to discuss current activities and programs and to increase public awareness. A $50,000 grant to undertake a review of current services and best practice interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders was announced at the Forum.and (6) The Australian Government is aware of the 'Partners in Autism Research' initiative and of the valuable research funding provided by the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund. From January 2001 to April 2005 the Government provided the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund with a total of $682,000 (GST exclusive) for the delivery of a national Mental Health Awareness Campaign, which has included the delivery of various mental health forums across Australia.</DOC>

Payment of $22,000 was made on 27 July 2005 under a contract with market research company Evalue Pty Ltd. This payment was incorrectly recorded in the AusTender electronic database as an additional contract under the heading: 'Research and experimental development services on social sciences and humanities'. The title refers to a generic code belonging to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Commodity Classification (ANZSCC) system used by the database. A more accurate code would have been 'Market research and public opinion polling services'.The purpose of the research was to identify opportunities to improve debt service delivery, as recommended in the ANAO's audit report on the Management of Customer Debt tabled on 2 August 2004.</DOC>

No. The Welfare to Work package, announced in the 2005-06 Budget, included $210 million over four years to significantly increase the number of child care places available to support parents with participation obligations.There is a considerable research literature on the effect of child care costs on labour force participation. Much of the research to date suggests the cost of child care is one of many factors that may influence participation decisions.The Government has greatly improved the affordability of child care through the introduction of both the Child Care Benefit (CCB) and the Child Care Tax Rebate.In addition, the Welfare to Work package also included additional funding for the Jobs, Education and Training child care programme, which will assist 52,000 low income families in meeting the 'gap' in child care fees, ensuring that the cost of child care is not a barrier to moving from income support to employment.The Government has enacted the Child Care Tax Rebate to provide a 30% rebate for the costs associated with child care for working parents.</DOC>

Yes.The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will have significant air defence and strike capabilities. In the air defence role, the JSF is capable of detecting, tracking and destroying enemy aircraft and long-range cruise missiles.Yes.No. Such redeployment would only create the need for additional administrative and maintenance resources. If required, elements of the 16th Air Defence Regiment can be attached to other Australian Defence Force (ADF) units for deployment on operations or training.The number of officers and soldiers posted within the 16th Air Defence Regiment approximately equates to four rifle companies. However, any plan to redistribute the Regiment's people and equipment across the Army would leave the ADF with no ground-based air defence capability with which to protect existing units.The Government continues to modernise the ADF's combat capability as evidenced in the Defence Capability Plan 2004-2014.</DOC>

Government officials held informal discussions at the working level with officials from the United States (US) State Department and the US Department of Defense on the US Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI). The discussions were preliminary and aimed at ascertaining the nature of GPOI, the US expectations of our involvement and the intended outcomes for the region. Since these matters were clarified, discussions have progressed to consider possible options for cooperation. This culminated in an agreed approach to explore cooperative opportunities that were announced at the Australia-US Ministers' (AUSMIN) meeting in Adelaide on 18 November 2005.GPOI is primarily a funding program for global and regionally-based bilateral and multilateral engagements designed to strengthen peace operations capacity, interoperability and coordination. The US expressed its interest to work with Australia in the Asia Pacific region owing to our expertise and well-established programs in the region. Any involvement in GPOI will be consistent with the Government's policy objectives in the region. On 18 November 2005, at the AUSMIN meeting, the Government agreed to explore opportunities for cooperation with our neighbours and allies through GPOI.</DOC>

Attachment A
UNESCO Draft Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions
AUSTRALIAN INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT
UNESCO GENERAL CONFERENCE  -  COMMISSION IV (CULTURE)
Paris, 18 October 2005Thank you Mr Chair for the opportunity to present this statement.Australia is a strong supporter of cultural diversity and agrees with the basic aim of the draft Convention before us. However, Australia regrets that a lack of sufficient negotiating time has prevented UNESCO members from achieving a complete consensus on the text of the draft Convention.Since the May negotiations Australia has conducted extensive inter-agency consultations and has considered the text very carefully at all levels of Government. I have been asked to register Australia's concerns about key articles of the Convention and would ask that this statement be entered formally on the record of this meeting.
Relationship to Other Instruments
Australia is concerned that the matters to be regulated by the Convention, and the way in which the text is drafted (particularly in relation to Articles 5, 6, 8, 16 and 20) may allow States Parties to implement measures which conflict with their obligations under other international agreements and standard setting regimes, particularly in the areas of trade and intellectual property.Australia acknowledges that Article 20 was the product of compromise. However, the Article in its current form fails to clarify the relationship of the draft Convention to other international instruments, and offers no guidance to assist States Parties in determining what would happen in the event of a conflict between the Convention and other treaties. The potential for inconsistency with other international obligations (including those relating to trade, intellectual property and human rights) is exacerbated by the current definitions contained in Article 4, which do not sufficiently delineate the scope of activities, goods and services covered by the Convention.
Potential Conflict with domestic laws and policies
Australia is also concerned that the text as drafted (notably in relation to Articles 6, 8 and 16) could give rise to pressure for Australia to implement policy initiatives which might conflict with government policy and programs, particularly in relation to culture.Furthermore, Article 16 on one interpretation raises the potential for conflict with Australia's legal requirements for migration.Mr Chair,Australia is a committed member and proud contributor to the work of UNESCO. From the outset, our preference has been for a text to be developed which addressed the need for complete clarity and complementarity with other international instruments. While Australia acknowledges the hard work of many who sought this outcome, unfortunately this text falls short of that need. Australia is therefore unable to support the text proposed and will abstain on adoption of the text.</DOC>

 -  (2)  In December 2003, the Australian Government approved $66m in funding for Ipswich Motorway, comprising $54.9m for interim safety works and $11.1m for concept planning and land acquisition.Interim safety works include:Strengthening of Warrego Highway rail overbridge (completed in January 2005).Strengthening of Bullockhead Creek culverts (completed in March 2005).Ramp improvements at Progress Road interchange (presently at Tender stage).Ramp improvements and installation of traffic signals at Centenary Highway interchange (completed in June 2005).Realignment of Ipswich Motorway at Granard Road interchange to provide left hand exit lanes off the northbound lanes on to Granard Road (in progress).Intelligent Transport Systems such as variable message signs and closed circuit television cameras (in progress).New bridges over Woogaroo Creek as part of early works to facilitate traffic management during construction of Logan Motorway interchange (in progress).Concept planning and land acquisition include:Detailed planning, concept design and specialist studies associated with the full six lane upgrade of Ipswich Motorway.Property acquisition under Queensland Government hardship guidelines.Provision of $500,000 for a feasibility investigation into a Northern Option (completed in April 2005 by Maunsell Australia).The Queensland Government is yet to submit a reconciliation of expenditure associated with the interim safety works and concept planning and land acquisition.The scope and timing of the $10 million detailed investigations into a Northern Option are yet to be confirmed. The Department of Transport and Regional Services will develop a project brief in cooperation with the Queensland Government Department of Main Roads. -  (5)  The Australian Government has committed $10 million for detailed investigations of a Northern Option. No final decisions can be made until these investigations are progressed. -  (7)  The Queensland Government Department of Main Roads (QDMR) commissioned a cost benefit analysis of its preferred six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway in 2003. Using a 7% discount rate, this analysis calculated a Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 2.43 and a Net Present Value (NPV) of $578 million. This analysis was based on a capital cost of $593.5 million (including contingencies) in 2003 dollars. The capital cost was reviewed by engineering consultant, Maunsell Australia, for QDMR in 2005 and adjusted to $1,098 million (including contingencies) in 2005 dollars. This increase in capital cost would significantly affect the BCR and NPV. The Ipswich Motorway Northern Option feasibility report by Maunsell Australia, which was completed in April 2005, estimated capital costs ranging from $820 million to $1,137 million (in 2005 dollars) for the three alignments identified as being potentially feasible. Maunsell Australia calculated for these options, BCR ranging from 1.4 to 1.9 and NPV ranging from $368 million to $531 million.Cost benefit analyses for the Queensland preferred six-lane upgrade is presented in planning reports prepared by the QDMR. Cost benefit analyses for the Northern Option feasibility study is presented in reports that are publicly available on the QDMR web site.</DOC>

Medicare Australia has undertaken qualitative and quantitative customer service and satisfaction research each year since 1984 for consumers and since 1991 for medical practitioners and pharmacists. In 2004 and 2005 Medicare Australia did not undertake qualitative research as part of its customer satisfaction research. However quantitative research was undertaken. The aim of the quantitative research was to capture and continue tracking customer satisfaction levels.Medicare Australia does not conduct customer satisfaction research at individual Medicare office level. Research has been focused on general customer satisfaction.Medicare Australia introduced a Service Charter in 1999, which outlines its obligations and standards of service, as well as benchmarks against which service performance can be measured including a performance indicator which aims to keep waiting times in Medicare offices below 10 minutes. Customer waiting times have been measured in the Hurstville Medicare Office as well as all other Medicare offices since 1999-2000.The methodology is based on manual counts at a number of specified times, considered to be indicative of customer flows. Initially queue times were measured, in all Medicare offices each Friday at 10.00am and 1.00pm. The times selected were considered to be when the majority of offices are very busy and most likely to have high levels of customer traffic.Since the commencement of extended business hours, the process has been increased to three days per week, Monday, Thursday and Friday at 10.00am, 1.00pm and 3.30pm.The information below demonstrates the results for the Hurstville Medicare office for the current financial year and the two previous financial years. Records dating back to 1997 have been destroyed in accordance with our records management and archiving policy.Financial YearNumber of Queue times recordedTimes recorded &gt; 10 mins2005/2006 YTD11052004/200514242003/2004486</DOC>

Once a debt has been identified and investigated, it is calculated. Centrelink has developed system based tools to assist in the correct calculation of a customer's debt. The customer must be formally advised of the existence of a debt through issue of a notice (Account Payable) before any recovery action can be taken.Centrelink procedure is that where appropriate and where possible, debt-raising staff will advise the customer beforehand that an Account Payable is being sent to them. An example of where it is not appropriate to contact the customer would be where a customer is under investigation for fraud. In some cases Centrelink attempts to contact the customer but is unable to do so.The Account Payable notice advises the customer of:the date of which the notice was issued;the reason the debt was incurred, including a brief explanation of the circumstances that led to the debt being incurred;the period to which the debt relates;the outstanding amount of the debt at the date of notice;the day on which the outstanding amount is due and payable (i.e. 28 days after the issue of the notice);the options available for repaying the debt;contact details for enquiries concerning the debt;the possibility that payments may be reduced to help recover the amount payable; andtheir right of appeal against the decision to raise the debt.The information is not available.The information is not available.</DOC>

The Australian Government does not determine the extent to which staff of United States Congressional committees are briefed on the operations of the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap.The Australian Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD (now the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security) do not consider the operations of the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap. The access of those committees and thus of their staff to information on Pine Gap is determined accordingly.Due to the different relationships between executive government and the legislature in the US and Australian systems, the US approach to access to sensitive intelligence matters and Congressional committees may well differ from the practice in Australia.Successive governments in Australia have taken the view that, as members of the executive are also members of the legislature, legislative transparency of activities at Pine Gap is sufficiently provided for by ensuring that those members of the legislature who are in relevant executive positions or in relevant opposition offices are fully briefed on the facility and its capabilities.The staff of parliamentary committees are briefed on intelligence matters in accordance with the work of the committee concerned and with Australia's obligations for the protection of intelligence information.</DOC>

In respect of the matters raised under the honourable member's questions 1(a) and (b), my Department has advised that these quotations represent excerpts from the Department's letters sent to a number of Airport Lessee Companies (ALCs) over recent years to clarify for them how the Australian Government envisages the lease provision relating to council rates would operate.The following is a full extract of the relevant paragraphs of the letters sent to the ALCs, as provided to me by my Department, to ensure this matter can be reviewed in its proper context:'Clause [number of clause] of the Airport Lease reflects current Commonwealth policy that an ex gratia payment in lieu of council rates should be payable on all areas in which trading or financial activities take place. The Commonwealth expects [name of Airport Lessee Company] to enter into arrangements with the relevant councils for the payment of rates.It is generally anticipated that in making these payments, [name of Airport Lessee Company] could expect the councils to provide services normally funded from rates on a similar basis to those provided to off-airport ratepayers. Where it can be shown that the services normally funded through rates are not provided at [name of Airport Lessee Company], we would expect a reasonable approach by councils would be to make an appropriate adjustment to rate assessments.However, we do not see a direct relationship between the amount of rates due and the services provided and resile strongly from the notion that [name of Airport Lessee Company] should only be obligated to pay local councils for the cost of services actually provided by them. Notwithstanding this, we believe there is scope in coming to an arrangement with councils for them to effectively discount some portion of rates to take account of the fact that some services may not be utilised by the airport.Under the terms of the Airport Lease we expect that [name of Airport Lessee Company] and the relevant councils examine matters in good faith in order to establish a mutually acceptable outcome.'The Australian Government's policy of competitive neutrality is the key principle behind each airport lease incorporating a clause (26.2) requiring ALCs to pay a rates equivalent amount (i.e. putting a federal leased airport and its tenants on a similar footing with other commercial landowners and tenants off-airport). These are referred to as ex gratia rates payments.The Department's advice was based on the belief that there is scope for the two parties, (ALC and council) to negotiate a commercial arrangement regarding the amount of ex gratia rates payable. This has been the practice for some years and the majority of airports around the country have reached acceptable agreed outcomes.The lease clause requires the ALC to undertake reasonable endeavours to negotiate a fair outcome on payment of these rates  -  one that is acceptable to all parties. The Department expects both parties to negotiate this agreement in good faith. If a resolution cannot be reached there is the option to explore independent dispute resolution mechanisms to reach an agreement.In the interests of clarity a full extract of the relevant clause that is contained in airport leases is as follows:
'26 RATES AND TAXES
26.1 Payment of Rates and Taxes
The Lessee may pay, on or before the due date, all Rates, Land Tax and Taxes without contribution from the Lessor.
26.2 Ex Gratia Payments in lieu of Rates and Taxes
(i)      which are sub-leased to tenants; or(ii)     on which trading or financial operations are undertaken including but not limited to retail outlets and concessions, car parks and valet car parks, golf courses and turf farms, but excluding runways, taxiways, aprons, roads, vacant land, buffer zones and grass verges, and land identified in the airport Master Plan for these purposes,The requirement for airports to make ex gratia payments in lieu of rates is a contractual obligation and is detailed in the Airport Leases. The Constitution provides that the Government is generally not subject to State/Territory taxes and hence has no liability in respect of council rates.I understand that my Department has sought a range of legal advice in regard to leasing Federal airport land and the payment of either rates or a rate equivalent amount. The legal advices have been sought to ensure that the Government's policy of competitive neutrality is implemented through the leasing arrangements. My Department's advice to ALCs was to clarify the policy intent in relation to Clause 26 of the Federal Airport leases.All Federal airport leases contain similar clauses to reflect the Government's policy of ensuring competitive neutrality in relation to the payment of local council rates.In implementing this principle, the Government expects the airport operator to enter into a good faith mutually acceptable arrangement with the local council for the payment of rate equivalent amounts.Under the airport leases ALCs are expected to pay ex gratia payments to councils to facilitate the competitive neutrality policy. This approach was adopted with a view to giving effect to the Government's policy and commitment to competitive neutrality between business 'on-airport' and their equivalent 'off-airport' competitors. This means that unfair advantage or disadvantage should not accrue to 'on-airport' tenants by virtue of their location on Commonwealth land.I am aware that some airports are involved in commercial negotiations with local councils regarding the appropriate level of ex gratia payments in lieu of rates. The basis on which these decisions are taken is a matter between individual airports and relevant councils.My Department's advice to ALCs clarifies the policy intent in Clause 26 of the Federal Airport leases.</DOC>

Yes.Initial wages for apprentices can be low by direct comparison with those of other junior workers.In terms of actual evidence of this issue, the minimum weekly wage for a first year apprentice under selected federal awards is as follows:Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998  -  Part 1 - Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Employees $242.84The Hospitality Industry  -  Accommodation, Hotels, Resorts and Gaming Award 1998 $318.00, or $289.10 for apprentices in TasmaniaFurnishing Industry National Award 2003 $242.84The Vehicle Industry - Repair, Services and Retail - Award 2002 $242.85In comparison, under the Transport Workers Award 1998, where a junior employee aged 18 or more is required to drive a motor vehicle and is in sole charge of the vehicle, the employee is paid the appropriate adult rate. The adult rate depends on the size and type of vehicle driven, but starts at $533.50 per weekAs a second comparison, under the National Building &amp; Construction Industry Award 2000 junior rates are not available in most States, and the basic weekly rate (without allowances) for a trades labourer is $546.20.(3)   No. The Australian Fair Pay Commission will set and adjust minimum and award classification wages. The award classification wage rates applying after the 2005 Safety Net Review will be locked in as the guaranteed minimum. In addition to this guarantee, greater flexibility to negotiate in the workplace will mean that employees will be able to share the gains from productivity improvements in the workplace. Further, employees are likely to benefit from the continued demand for labour underpinned by a sound economy and emerging demographic pressures.</DOC>

Australia is already very active in advocating abolition of the death penalty. Australia is one of only 56 parties to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which requires States Parties to abolish the death penalty within their jurisdictions. Australia is strongly committed to the principles espoused by the Second Optional Protocol and encourages its universal ratification.The Government supports international action to abolish the death penalty, or as an interim measure establish a moratorium on execution. Australia has traditionally co-sponsored the annual resolution to this effect at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Australia has also co-sponsored related resolutions in the Third Committee of the General Assembly. In 2005, we raised the death penalty in bilateral human rights dialogues with China and Vietnam. We also raised the use or possible use of the death penalty in bilateral contacts with a range of other states.</DOC>

The agencies used by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) for language analysis are amongst a small group of specialised agencies in the world which provide this service to countries conducting refugee status assessments.In Australia, language analysis results are not determinative of nationality and decision makers have to weigh up all available information when reaching their conclusions about the origins of visa applicants.The weight which decision makers give to language analysis results will depend on the circumstances of each individual case. Historically the overwhelming majority of language analysis results has helped to substantiate the claims made by visa applicants about their origins in circumstances where there is usually no other independent information to support their claims. In this regard the claimed Afghan boat arrival caseload was the overwhelming focus of language analysis in protection visa processing by the Department. Some 85% of that caseload was granted protection visas by the Department in the first instance.The two agencies currently used by DIMIA for language analysis are amongst a small group of specialised agencies in the world which provide a relevant service.The ideas set out in the document, where these are relevant to Australia, appear to be broadly consistent with the approach followed by the Department and review tribunals in relation to visa processing. The document places emphasis on the analysts holding particular personal academic qualifications. The language analysis agencies used by Australia in relation to protection visa processing place importance on formal qualifications but also apply broader institutional methodologies in relation to skill and competency maintenance and, importantly, quality assurance and empirical testing of analysts.See answer to part (1).The average costs of a language analysis report from:Eqvator  -  $1133.Sprakab  -  $686.The total cost of language analysis checks commissioned in the 12 months to 31 October 2005 was $24,363.DIMIA is always open to opportunities to obtain information which might assist in visa decision making.</DOC>

It would be of potentially significant commercial value to Telstra's competitors if they could access this information. For example, access to this information would allow competitors to revise their own level of spending on advertising so that they could match or exceed Telstra's expenditure. Also by providing an aggregate amount of Telstra's promotional spend, Telstra's competitors could obtain a reasonably good understanding of the split between Telstra's advertising spend (which has been estimated by external organisations) relative to Telstra's spend on direct mail and telemarketing. Such knowledge could put those competitors in a position to compete unfairly with Telstra in circumstances where they are not obliged to make reciprocal disclosure of the amounts they spend for the same purpose. Exposing Telstra to such inequitable detriment would prejudice Telstra's commercial interests and thereby the interests of its stakeholder owners, whether private shareholders or, through the Commonwealth's shareholding, Australian taxpayers.

None.There are no international measures involving states currently under development to ban anti-vehicle mines (AVMs). The majority of countries do not support such a ban. Australia strongly supports efforts by states parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) to address the humanitarian concerns caused by AVMs which persist after the cessation of conflict. Discussion continues on negotiation of a protocol restricting the use of AVMs by requiring all AVMs to be detectable and all remotely-delivered AVMs to be engineered to self-destruct, self-neutralise and self-deactivate within a set timeframe.</DOC>

and (4) Yes.and (3) The Government has not seen any information suggesting that such operations have been carried out. Statements such as those made by Brigadier-General Kossari appear to be intended as a tactic by some in Iran to threaten retaliation if international pressure on the nuclear issue increases.As a member of the IAEA Board of Governors, Australia has played an important part in international efforts aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapons capability. Since September 2003, Australia has supported and helped secure a series of IAEA Board resolutions on Iran. These resolutions have included calls for Iran both to cooperate with the IAEA in its investigations to determine the nature of Iran's nuclear activities, and to maintain and re-establish full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as Iran committed to do in the context of negotiations with the EU3 (UK, France, Germany) on a long-term agreement. Most recently, Resolution GOV/2005/77 of 24 September 2005 found Iran in non-compliance of its NPT Safeguards Agreement and foreshadowed reporting Iran to the UN Security Council.I (Mr Downer) have taken regular opportunities to impress on Iran Australia's concerns about Iran's nuclear activities and our expectations that Iran cooperate fully and immediately with the IAEA.Australia's total merchandise trade with Iran (exports + imports) in 2004-05 was A$193 million, which comprised exports to Iran of A$169 million and imports from Iran of A$24 million.Australia is working with its partners on the IAEA Board of Governors, including the EU3 (UK, France and Germany) to encourage Iran to cooperate fully and immediately with the IAEA and to provide assurances that its nuclear activities are for exclusively peaceful purposes.</DOC>

Australia's long-standing opposition to the death penalty is well known. Singapore maintains a position of support for capital punishment. Australia has traditionally co-sponsored resolutions at the Commission on Human Rights that call upon states that have not yet done so to abolish the death penalty and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on executions. Australia has also co-sponsored related resolutions in the Third Committee of the General Assembly.On 28 January 1993, the Government of Australia declared that it recognised the competence of the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider communications under Article 41 of the Covenant.As only States Parties to the Covenant may make declarations under Article 41, the question of raising Article 41 with Singapore does not arise.</DOC>

Australia is aware of the competing claims over the territory of Western Sahara. Australia supports an early and durable political settlement on the Western Sahara that is acceptable to all directly interested parties and supports the earliest possible holding of a referendum to allow the population of the Western Sahara to exercise its right to self determination, so long as that remains the only process fully endorsed by the United Nations for resolving the dispute. A UN-sponsored referendum would provide a clear indication of the wishes of the population of Western Sahara.</DOC>

to (4) The issue of the specificity of the terrorist offences in the Criminal Code had been raised in various contexts for some months prior to the legislative amendments. The Government commissioned a review of counter-terrorism laws after the London bombing which included whether amendments were needed to the terrorist act offences. This work was progressed through normal Government processes, including the involvement of intelligence and law enforcement agencies, over July  -  November 2005.Setting legislative priorities is a balancing act which can be rapidly modified by changing events. The London bombing on 7 July 2005 was such an event. After the bombing there was an opportunity to bring the amendments forward as part of the Anti-Terrorism Bill after the Government received specific intelligence and police information about a potential terrorist threat. The Government was satisfied on the advice provided to it that the immediate passage of the bill would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to effectively respond to the threat.The Prime Minister and other relevant Ministers have ongoing dialogues on law enforcement and national security issues with the relevant agencies.No.</DOC>

Universities may use the funds they receive for Commonwealth supported places through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS) and from student contributions for their general operations subject to compliance with the Higher Education Support Act 2003 (HESA) and guidelines made under the Act.Guidelines made under HESA require higher education providers to charge fee-paying overseas students a tuition fee that is sufficient to recover the full cost of delivering a course.My Department monitors compliance with the legislative provisions in HESA, including through the data submitted by providers as part of the Student Data Collection, the Audited Financial Statements and the Institutional Assessment Framework., (4), (5) La Trobe University, like all Australian universities, is an autonomous institution; as such it is not required to provide the information referred to in Questions (2) and (3) to the Australian Government. According to La Trobe University accounts for 2004/05, the university received 61.5 per cent of its total operating revenue from Australian Government sources (including HECS). The costs referred to by the Member are not sourced in the University's accounts to individual lines of income.The manner in which each university utilises Commonwealth funding is conditional on each university complying with the quality and accountability requirements, in accordance with Section 19 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The quality and accountability measures require all higher education providers, including La Trobe University, to present a financial statement annually to my Department, verifying that they are, and are likely to remain, financially viable. These financial statements do not require individual expenditure items to be matched to sources of revenue. Universities' financial statements are audited by the relevant State Government under whose legislation the University is constituted and governed.My Department is not supplied with to the details of an individual university's financial and travel accounts. La Trobe University's governing council has publicly stated its intention to conduct an independent audit of travel by all senior management staff.</DOC>

Mr Hicks was captured by Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan in early December 2001. He was handed into United States custody by the Northern Alliance. I do not know the exact date that occurred.Mr Hicks was charged on 10 June 2004.Mr Hicks was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.Yes.The Government has consistently urged the United States to ensure Mr Hicks' trial proceeds as expeditiously as possible. The Government has had discussions with the United States administration regarding the Military Commission system. The Government obtained additional commitments relating to Australian detainees which will apply to Mr Hicks' case. Those commitments include the following:- Based upon the specific facts of his case, the United States has assured Australia that it will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks' case.- Australia and the United States agreed to work towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks to Australia, if convicted, to serve any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and United States laws.- Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers will not be monitored by the United States.- The prosecution in Mr Hicks' case does not intend to rely on evidence in its case-in-chief requiring closed proceedings from which Mr Hicks could be excluded.- Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Mr Hicks' trial will be open, the media will be present and Australian officials may observe the proceedings.- The Australian Government may make submissions to the Review Panel which would review Mr Hicks' Military Commission trial.- Should Mr Hicks choose to retain an Australian lawyer with appropriate security clearances as a consultant to his legal team, that person may have direct face-to-face communications with their client.- Mr Hicks may talk to his family via telephone and two family members are permitted to attend his trial.- An independent legal expert sanctioned by the Australian Government may observe the trial of Mr Hicks.Following the preliminary hearing in August 2004, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I instructed officials to seek some improvements to some operational and procedural aspects of the Military Commission process. A number of improvements, including to the rules of procedure, have occurred since then and the Government will continue to monitor the process.</DOC>

The final communiqué was endorsed by all CHOGM delegation heads, including the Prime Minister. To prepare a more detailed response would entail a significant diversion of resources and in the circumstances I do not consider the additional work can be justified.This information is available through the United Nations Treaty Collection (http://untreaty.un.org), which can be accessed through the Parliamentary Library.</DOC>

The precise number of people within the Major Powers and Global Interests Branch (MPGI) in Defence varies over time but, as at 10 January 2006, there were 29 positions in the Branch  -  28 Australian Public Service positions and 1 Australian Defence Force position. The Branch now has five sections: Americas section (5 positions); Joint Facilities and Technical Programs section (4 positions); Iraq section (5 positions); Afghanistan/Middle East section (7 positions); and United Nations Europe, Africa and Peace Operations (6 positions). The final two positions making up the 29 are the Branch Head and the Branch Administration Officer.The responsibilities of MPGI Branch changed with the creation of a fourth Branch in International Policy Division in mid-January 2006. After this re-organisation, one Branch will have responsibility for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East, Africa and United Nations Peace Operations. Another Branch will cover the United States and Joint Facilities, as well as Europe and the Americas. This Branch will also assume responsibility for North and South Asia from the existing Asia Branch.The current Assistant Secretary MPGI is Mr John Owens. As a matter of policy, Defence does not publicly identify non-Senior Executive Service officers.</DOC>

YesThe on-line register is used to help consular officers find travellers in the event of an emergency. Australians overseas can contact the 24 hour DFAT Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135, or any of our overseas missions to seek assistance.Measures have been implemented on the passports website, in light of the increasing incidence of identity theft, to make it more secure and to prevent the online cancellation of passports by individuals who are not the rightful holders. In order to report a passport lost or stolen, people are required to provide the name of their guarantor or, in the event of the passport's having been renewed, the expiry date. If a holder is unable to provide the required details for cancelling the passport online, they can submit an email, the address of which is located under Contact Us on the Passports webpage. Alternatively, by following the Smartraveller link from the Passports webpage, they will immediately see a 24-hour emergency contact phone number which is a free call from anywhere in the world. They would be put through to the DFAT Watch Office which would, by asking for some personal details from the passport holder to confirm identity, record the passport as lost.The Australian Consulate in Guayaquil, Ecuador closed on 14 September 2005. The information on the DFAT website as of 13 September 2005 was accurate.On 14 September 2005.The government has provided a number of ways by which Australian travellers can contact DFAT to report their travel documents lost:Via www.passports.gov.au;By sending an email to passports.australia@dfat.gov.au;By contacting the nearest Australian Embassy or Consulate (or Canadian mission providing consular assistance to Australians);By phoning the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre (free call);By phoning the Australian Passport Information Service in Australia or, after hours, the DFAT Watch Office;By reporting the loss to Secure Sentinel  -  www.securesentinel.com.auNo. It is for the Ecuadorian authorities, and not the Australian government, to consider any maritime accident report and take any action arising from it.The travel advice for Ecuador is available in full on the smartraveller website (www.smartraveller.gov.au). It advises Australians in Ecuador to exercise caution and monitor developments that might affect their safety because of the risk of terrorism and civil unrest. DFAT first issued a travel advice for Ecuador in October 1999.No. DFAT does not collect statistics on shipping accidents.The travel advice for Ecuador contains the following statement:'The safety standards Australians might expect of tour operators are not always met, including those operating in the Galapagos Islands. Written confirmation should be obtained from the travel agent or tour operator that their vessel is certified by the Ecuadorian navy to meet the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention standards.'My Department keeps all its travel advisories under review to provide Australian travellers with a realistic understanding of the risks overseas, so they can make their own informed travel decisions in light of the potential risks.</DOC>

Yes. DFAT did not have a Section 31 agreement in place in 1997-98 for the period 1 July 1997 to 17 May 1998, resulting in contraventions of Section 83 of the Constitution and Section 48 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. All prior and subsequent period expenditures were found to have been correctly authorised.Refer (1).Refer (1).Note 28A of the financial statements in the 2004-05 Annual Report acknowledged the error and provided details of the cause.Yes.No officer has been disciplined for the error. None of the officers working at the time is any longer working in the area and/or have left the department. Improved expenditure controls and a greater understanding of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 will ensure such errors do not re-occur.</DOC>

The decision to relocate the chancery in Rome was made on commercial grounds. The former chancery was a six storey property that was leased in the 1970s when the size of the embassy establishment was significantly greater than it is today. The new chancery is a leased three-level free-standing building that provides substantially more cost-effective, functional and secure accommodation. The chancery was relocated in July 2004 at a total project cost of $3.6 million, comprising the cost of project concept and planning ($25,000), design and development ($119,000), and construction and other fit-out costs ($3,458,000).</DOC>

The Department does not classify individual posts as 'hardship posts' but rates posts on a six-point scale (A to F) reflecting the level of hardship. The Department subscribes to a specialist international human resources firm to provide the ratings, which are updated on an annual basis. Posts rated B to F attract some form of financial compensation, with those rated F at the top of the range. The following lists posts that are currently included in the B to F range.Abu DhabiAbujaAccraAmmanAnkaraApiaAthensBaghdadBaliBandar Seri BegawanBangkokBeijingBeirutBelgradeBrasiliaBudapestBuenos AiresCairoColomboDhakaDiliGuangzhouHanoiHarareHo Chi MinhHoniaraIslamabadJakartaKathmanduKuala LumpurKuwait CityManilaMexico CityMoscowNairobiNew DelhiNoumeaNuku'alofaPhnom PenhPohnpeiPort LouisPort MoresbyPort of SpainPort VilaPretoriaRamallahRangoonRiyadhSantiago de ChileSeoulShanghaiSuvaTaipeiTarawaTehranTel AvivVientianeWarsawZagrebThe Department does not classify individual posts as 'hardship posts'.

and (b) I am aware of the practice known as 'slamming' and that a number of Telstra account holders in the Newcastle region have claimed to have been transferred to another telecommunications service provider without their consent in May 2005.Telstra has advised that it is also aware of these incidents on a significant number of its customers in the Newcastle area. Telstra has advised that it issued warnings via the media to customers in the area to be wary of telemarketing calls if they were unsure about who was calling them. Telstra has advised that it investigated these complaints and asked the 'gaining' carrier or service provider to provide proof that the customer authorised their respective transfer of service away from Telstra.and (b) Telstra has advised that it is unable to automatically reinstate customers when they advise Telstra that they have been 'churned' to another carrier without their consent. Telstra has advised that it will investigate and is obliged to allow the gaining carrier or service provider to provide proof that the customer was legitimately churned away from Telstra. Telstra has requested gaining carriers or service providers to provide a valid Transfer Authority Form authorising the churn for each affected customer. If the carrier or service provider is unable to supply a valid Transfer Authority Form in the required timeframe Telstra will request the carrier or service provider to reverse the churn and return the customer's service back to Telstra.Telstra has advised that while it will act on behalf of the customer to seek to remedy the situation, it is not able to discuss with the customer his or her account with the gaining service provider. These account details, including charges and bill amounts, are a matter between the service provider and its customer.Under Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997, which protects the privacy of personal information and prohibits the disclosure or use of such information by a customer's service provider except in certain specified circumstances, including where the customer gives express consent, Telstra must not use any information it holds for a purpose other than that for which it was disclosed.If a person was churned to another service provider without his or her authorisation, Telstra can request that provider to reverse the churn, as indicated in the answer to part (2) of the question. If the transfer to another provider was authorised but the consumer wishes to return to Telstra, then this can be effected as a further transfer in a timely manner, subject to the provision of a valid Transfer Authority Form.Depending on the circumstances, 'slamming' may constitute an offence under Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 or state or territory fair trading legislation. Fines may be imposed for contravening a provision of Part V and a person may be prosecuted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for the commission of an offence. It is appropriately a matter for the ACCC to determine whether to prosecute on a case by case basis.Legislative amendment is not necessary. There are processes in place under three industry codes of practice developed under the auspices of the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF), ie the Customer Transfer code, the Commercial Churn code and the Pre-selection code, for addressing unauthorised transfers and enabling consumers' pre-selection choices to be correctly implemented and remedied where errors have occurred.The Customer Transfer code, which is currently under review, sets minimum standards to ensure all transfers of service that occur are authorised and verified. The code is being reviewed to strengthen consumer protection, including verification of authorised representatives, options available regarding marketing calls and alignment with the Privacy Act 1988 and state and territory legislation on fair trading and door to door sales.The Commercial Churn code requires that service providers must take immediate action to rectify an invalid churn in accordance with a customer's wishes, and notify the customer of what has happened. If a customer has suffered a direct financial loss as a result of the unauthorised transfer, he or she can complain to the service provider and provide any relevant substantiation of that claim.The Pre-selection code sets out the operational procedures for implementing customer's pre-selection choices for new services and for changes due to the customer's change of address, phone number of cancellation of a service. The code also sets out the procedures for authorising a customer's pre-selection choice and the reversal process for correcting unauthorised transfers.Telstra has advised that any customer who considers he or she may be the victim of an unauthorised transfer can report the incident to the Telstra SalesWatch Hotline on 1800 260 270.</DOC>

Yes. I will be attending the meeting of the High Seas Task Force in my capacity as Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Officers from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (the Department) will also be in the official delegation.No (ii) NoThe Australian Government recognises that responsible flag state and port state behaviour is central to strong deterrence of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. To help tackle the problem of flag states that fail to live up to their international obligations, the High Seas Task Force has developed a set of guidelines on flag state performance for fishing vessels. At the High Seas Task Force meeting, the Government, along side other members of the Task Force, will consider agreeing and promoting these guidelines internationally.The release of a recent report detailing how flags of convenience provide a cover for IUU fishing resulted in discussions between Departmental officers and the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) regarding the function of open registries in the shipping and fishing industries. The International Maritime Organisation supports the use of open registries for the world commercial shipping industry. However, open registries also present a large and growing problem that seriously inhibits the ability of States and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations to manage the global industrial fishing fleet and tackle IUU fishing. The Department will continue to engage with DOTARS as it is important that the issue of open registries and fishing vessels be resolved.</DOC>

The Japanese Government has not yet decided when their deployment in Al Muthanna will cease, therefore, it is not possible to say how many construction works will be completed.On 8 December 2005, the Japanese Government extended the mandate of the Japan Self Defense Forces deployment to Iraq for a period of one year. The Japanese Government decision did not alter the size, composition, activity or area of operations of the Japanese deployment in Al Muthanna. The Japanese Government has stated that any decision regarding withdrawal of their forces for Al Muthanna would be made in close consultation with the Australian and British Governments.The ADF will continue to provide in-theatre security for the duration of the Japanese deployment to Al Muthanna province.The Government has been advised that the withdrawal of United States (US) and British forces would not be based on a specific timetable. We understand the US and British withdrawal would occur in a phased manner as the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) become capable of taking the security lead within areas of Iraq. The developing capabilities of relevant Iraqi government institutions and their readiness to assume responsibility for areas in Iraq will also be factors considered in planning for coalition withdrawal.Defence is not aware of any plans to withdraw medivac, helicopter or artillery support from Al Muthanna Province before May 2006.Any plans for a British withdrawal would be based on the attainment of certain conditions as outlined in the response to part (4). Control would be progressively transferred to the Iraqis as their capacity for assuming control in each area is established, in consultation with coalition forces. British withdrawal would be dependent on the ISF assuming responsibility for security in the relevant area.Yes, RAAF aircraft face a variety of rocket, missile and small arms threats. However, the only time an aircraft has been damaged was on 27 June 2004, when an Australian C-130 was targeted by small arms fire while departing Baghdad International Airport. The aircraft was hit by one round resulting in the death of a US civilian contractor. No Australians were injured. This is the only incidence of an Australian aircraft being hit by ground fire during Operation CATALYST.This question should be directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.The recommendations of The Flood Report were endorsed and are being implemented.Maintaining law and order following the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime presented many challenges. In responding to these challenges, coalition forces have distinguished themselves in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Since the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime, coalition forces have been involved in the stabilisation and reconstruction of Iraq. These reconstruction efforts include the raising and training of the ISF who are gradually assuming responsibility for law and order in their own country.The Iraqi Army has been given and continues to receive extensive training and mentoring by coalition forces in counter-insurgency techniques, tactics and procedures based on accepted allied doctrine.Since the cessation of formal hostilities in May 2003, the Coalition has been involved in the training of the ISF to enable it to assume responsibility for security of Iraq as soon as possible. The level and scope of collective training of ISF units is being progressively expanded to address the range of threats that they will face in the execution of their duties in Iraq.(a)   The Multi-National Security Transition Command  -  Iraq is responsible for developing the central structures for the effective employment of a national army. Australia is contributing to this task.(b)   Yes, but the majority of weapons are standardised and most tactical vehicles are American.(c)   There are some minor differences in operating procedures due to the training teams originating from different members of the coalition. Nevertheless, training by coalition forces is based on accepted allied doctrine.Australia continues to support development in Iraq in this realm through the provision of approximately $12 million in electoral assistance to the United Nations Electoral Division, which has contributed to meeting the cost of conducting elections and building the capacity of the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq. This sum is part of Australia's provision of over $170 million in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to date, and stands alongside the commitment of more than 30 advisers to provide expert and technical assistance in fields such as agriculture, economic and trade reform, electricity generation and donor coordination.(a) and (b) While the Government acknowledges that the ethnic, religious, and political divisions within the Iraqi Army are a matter for Iraq, it is mindful of the importance of cooperation between Iraqi ethnic groups in the formation of a professional national Defence Force. The training of Iraqi units by the Australian Army Training Team continues to be delivered in a professional, honest and culturally sensitive manner.All intelligence available to the Government was taken into account in deciding to commit forces to Iraq.Yes.There have been a range of measures initiated and implemented within the Defence Intelligence Organisation to meet the recommendations of the 2004 Flood Report, including measures to improve the coordination and contestability of intelligence.The Commander of Joint Task Force 633 ensures that the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Al Muthanna Task Group receive the most recent intelligence.No.</DOC>

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was asked by the National Archives of Australia (NAA) for advice on papers lodged with the NAA by Sir Paul Hasluck. The Department was not aware of the identity of the individual who requested access to those papers.and (3) The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised the NAA on 25 November 2004 that it had consulted the Hon E G Whitlam AC QC and that, consistent with his views, the Department considered that two sentences in one document titled Adjustment of Ministry, October 1973 contained information the disclosure of which would be an unreasonable disclosure of the personal affairs of an individual. The Department also drew the NAA's attention to two other documents in the papers (Mr Whitlam Discusses Prospects, December 1973 and Mr Whitlam Looks Ahead, March 1974) that had been referred to it and suggested that the NAA consider whether certain deletions should be made to them. Finally, the Department advised the NAA that it had discussed the papers with the Official Secretary to the Governor-General and it expected that the Official Secretary would be in touch with the NAA about them. A copy of the Department's letter to the NAA was sent to the Official Secretary for his information.I am advised by the Official Secretary that he discussed the principles surrounding the timing of the release of private papers of former governors-general with the Governor-General.The answer to part (5) of this Question has been provided in response to Question No. 1512 which the honourable member addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.</DOC>

Chaplaincy ServicesThe Department has contracts in place with the Anglican, Baptist, Catholic and Uniting Churches for the provision of chaplaincy services at former Repatriation General Hospitals. It is assumed that the chaplains meet certain religious requirements of the church that employs them.Veterans Line.The Department has a contract with The Salvation Army (NSW) Property Trust to operate Veterans Line which is carried out by the Salvation Army 24 hour telephone counselling service, Salvo Care Line. The conditions of employment for employees of The Salvation Army are not known.Veteran &amp; Community Grants.The Department has provided funds under its Veteran &amp; Community Grant program to religious bodies and is not aware of funds being approved for religious specific requirements. The conditions of employment for employees of these religious bodies are not known. Funds are available to community and veteran community organisations and groups that meet the program Guidelines.In 2004-05, one grant of $1 400 was approved to a religious organisation, the Morialta Uniting Church. Funds were to install a telephone in the workshop that was independent of the Church office to ensure prompt access to emergency services if needed. The target group for the project is primarily older veterans who participate in workshop activities, which include woodworking and some metalworking.Chaplaincy Services.The Department provides funding for the provision of pastoral care and commemorative activities at the former Repatriation General Hospitals, Greenslopes and Hollywood. The Department does not specifically fund religious instruction or faith based counselling.Veterans Line.No.Veteran and Community Grants.No.Chaplaincy Services.Chaplains provide ministry to the whole hospital community including facilitating pastoral care for persons who hold other than Christian beliefs and are funded on this basis.Veterans Line.Yes. The contract with Salvo Care requires its employees to abide by the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct that requires employees to take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest (real or apparent).Veteran &amp; Community Grants.Projects with a religious or evangelical purpose are not eligible for Veteran &amp; Community (V&amp;C) Grants funding under the program Guidelines. Successful V&amp;C Grants applicants enter into a grant agreement that clearly states the purpose for which the grant funding must be used.Chaplaincy Services.The funding is for the provision of pastoral care to the sick and the commemoration of events significant to the veteran community. Within that context, no constraints are placed upon those delivering the care.Veterans Line.The Department commissions reports and regularly reviews the service provider to monitor the quality of the service and ensure it is consistent with the contract.Veteran and Community Grants.Under the grant agreement, the grant recipient is required to acquit the grant to show that the funds were used for the approved and agreed purposes.</DOC>

Federal funding of chaplaincy services at Repatriation Hospitals has not been cut.The amount specifically identified for funding of chaplaincy/pastoral care services at former Repatriation Hospitals in 2005 - 06 is $771 390 (excluding GST).The amount specifically identified for funding chaplaincy/pastoral care services at former Repatriation Hospitals in 2004 - 05 was $755 125 (excluding GST).Funding for chaplaincy services is provided on the basis that it is of value to the veteran community. Reports are received on specific commemorative activity undertaken by chaplains under these arrangements. However, there is no accurate measure of the chaplains' interaction with veteran patients at former Repatriation Hospitals, as there are obvious sensitivities about the collection of such information. Recent inaccurate reports that the Department was reducing funding for chaplaincy services at Daw Park attracted strong representations from Ex-Service Organisations that attest to the significance that the veteran community places on the availability of these services.</DOC>

Mr Abbott discussed his travel plans with me (Mr Downer) before his trip. DFAT officers were not informed of the Minister for Health and Ageing's intention to visit Bali with his family, as the Minister was travelling in a private capacity.When Mr Abbott advised me (Mr Downer) that he was intending to travel to Bali for a holiday I advised him to consult the travel advice for Indonesia.No. For any official travel the travelling Minister's office would deal directly with the Protective Security Coordination Centre.The Australian Consulate General in Bali was not informed of the prospective visit to Bali by the Minister for Health and Ageing and his family. The Consul General became aware of the Minister's presence in Bali when the Minister initiated contact with the Consulate to offer his assistance to the victims of the bombing.Decisions about travel can only be made by the individuals concerned.The private travel of Government Ministers and senior officials is a private matter for them.</DOC>

When a complainant leaves Defence prior to the finalisation of a complaint, the process can continue if the respondent is still a Defence member. There is a higher proportion of sexual offences that have not been substantiated than for other categories. This is mainly because they are criminal offences for which, in many cases, the civilian police have found insufficient evidence to prosecute.The honourable member should note that reasons for the increased reporting include:increased awareness of what constitutes unacceptable behaviour;mandatory training in 2003-04 and 2004-05 emphasised the processes for making and managing complaints;greater confidence that issues will be addressed by management;Services have increased efforts to encourage units to submit reports; andincreased culture of reporting in the Australian Defence Force.</DOC>

$9 104 000The memorial was fully maintained under warranty for 12 months from November 2003. From November 2004 to June 2005 $19 000 was expended.The Memorial does not specifically recognise any Prime Ministers. It comprises a long curving wall set with 24,000 place names recording the home towns of Australian men and women who served during the two world wars. Superimposed on these place names are 47 battle sites, representing theatres of war where Australians served. It also features the three Service insignia  -  Navy, Army and Air Force  -  and the Australian Commonwealth Coat of Arm as well as the quotation 'Whatever burden you are to carry, we also will shoulder that burden' by the wartime Prime Minister Robert Menzies is inscribed on the Memorial. 'The OAWG sought a quote that encapsulated the Memorial's aim: to commemorate those Australians who served alongside Britons in the two world wars. The quotation 'Whatever burden you are to carry, we also will shoulder that burden' by Prime Minister Menzies was determined to be the most suitable. The Memorial was completed before the Hon De-Anne Kelly MP was appointed Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</DOC>

However, Defence and the Coroners have been engaged in extensive consultations and it is anticipated that appropriate arrangements will be finalised in 2006.No, Defence is not aware of such a document.No. Within Defence, Defence Instruction (General) Personnel 20-6 'Deaths within and outside Australia of Australian Defence personnel' and Australian Defence Force (ADF) Publication 202 'Administrative Inquiries Manual' provide information and advice on the management of these matters. Further, the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and the State/Territory coroners have been the subject of ongoing discussions and exercises.The Administrative Inquiries Manual and the Defence Instruction must be read with the applicable Defence legislation, including a Ministerial direction issued by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence on 5 May 2004. Together, these documents set out the roles and responsibilities of the ADF and State/Territory Coroners where a member of the ADF dies while in service. The Defence Instruction will be reviewed, with some minor amendments expected, to improve consistency with the Ministerial Direction.Defence Instructions are general orders for the purposes of section 29 of the Defence Force Discipline Act (1988). Members of the ADF may be subject to disciplinary action under the Act for a failure to comply with any mandatory terms.Yes.and (7) The policy is contained in the Defence Instruction (General) Personnel and the Administrative Inquiries Manual, which apply to, and are readily accessible by, all members of the ADF.</DOC>

No. I understand the report will be submitted to the 62nd session of the Commission on Human Rights around March 2006. I have seen the Special Rapporteur's press release of 2 December 2005, which provides an overview of the visit.I am aware from the press release that the Special Rapporteur said that his predecessors received reports of a pattern of torture of this nature.I am aware from the press release that the Special Rapporteur said that these methods of torture had been and continue to be documented by international human rights organisations. On the basis of the information he received during his mission, the Special Rapporteur confirmed that many of these methods have been used in China.The Government has no reason to doubt findings a) and b) in the Special Rapporteur's press release. The Government will study the report when it is released.Yes, Australia has consistently raised the issue of torture in China, including at the most recent Australia China Human Rights dialogue, last held in Beijing in June 2005. The Chinese Government has acknowledged that although torture is illegal under Chinese law, it remains a problem in China. The Chinese Government has said that it is making efforts to address this problem.The Government will continue to raise these and other human rights concerns with the Chinese Government at a senior level.The Government believes that engaging the Chinese authorities in a continuing process of dialogue, combined with a Human Rights Technical Cooperation program, is the most effective and practical way of achieving tangible improvements in China's human rights performance in the long term. In addition, the Government continues to raise human rights concerns with the Chinese Government outside the dialogue context, including during high-level visits and through our Embassy in Beijing.The Human Rights Dialogue provides an opportunity to raise general human rights issues as well as individual cases of concern. It enables us to conduct frank and constructive discussion on all areas of concern, including the treatment of political prisoners; rights of assembly, association and expression; torture; the death penalty; re-education through labour; ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang; North Korean border crossers and workers rights.The human rights dialogue is underpinned by a human rights technical cooperation program. This program aims to assist in the implementation of systemic reforms that will help strengthen the administration, promotion and protection of human rights in China. Assistance is provided in three main areas: legal reform; women's and children's rights; and ethnic and minority rights. The program has achieved outcomes in a range of areas, for example helping address women's rights and domestic violence in ethnic minority areas; training prison officers to advance protection of prisoners' rights; and in the operational protection of human rights by addressing prosecution procedures and practices, and the rules of criminal evidence.The Government has consistently raised the issue of torture with the Chinese Government in the Human Rights Dialogue since it began in 1997. International pressure has contributed to China taking some steps to acknowledge and address the problem of torture in China, including by allowing the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit.The Government will consider the report of the Special Rapporteur when it becomes available. On the basis of the report, the Government will then decide what response is required.</DOC>

Yes.Australia took a leading role in the Paris Peace Process, and continues to take its obligations as a signatory to the 1991 Agreements, and commitment to rebuilding Cambodia, seriously.Australia is continuing to work with Cambodia to help it create the political, economic and social conditions conducive to an independent, self-sufficient and democratic society.Yes. The Australian Ambassador in Phnom Penh has raised the Australian Government's concerns at senior levels in the Cambodian Government on a regular basis. Sam Rainsy and Cheam Channy have received Royal pardons and Sam Rainsy returned to Cambodia on 10 February 2006.The Australian Government did not remain silent.In 2005-06, total Australian aid flows to Cambodia are estimated to total $42.7 million. The Australia-Cambodia Development Cooperation Strategy 2003-2006 focuses on increasing productivity and incomes of the rural poor, strengthening the rule of law and reducing the vulnerability of the poor. Information about Australian aid to Cambodia can be found on AusAID's internet site (http://www.ausaid.gov.au).No. Australia is working towards the long-term goals of a self-sufficient, stable and democratic Cambodia.</DOC>

Yes.I understand that there were violent clashes between villagers and police in relation to a long running dispute over land requisition and compensation. At some point police fired shots on villagers. There are conflicting reports of the number of people killed and injured. Chinese media have reported that three people were killed and eight injured. Other media reports placed the number killed as between ten and twenty people. Chinese media have reported that the commander of police on site has been arrested for investigation.No. My department is monitoring the case. Details are still unclear. I have instructed our Embassy in Beijing to raise the case with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Yes. I am aware of reports of increasing economic and political disturbances in China. This is not surprising in a country undergoing a major socioeconomic transformation. Australia will continue to pursue its foreign policy interests with China, using a range of consultative mechanisms to address concerns.The Government has noted this statement. Australia encourages China to guarantee the rights of association and assembly and the right to peaceful protest. Australia also encourages China to recognise that allowing its people to express grievances, including against government policy, promotes long-term social stability.</DOC>

An Integrated Operating Concept (IOC), which details a joint vision for the future of Air Traffic Management in Australia, was signed by Defence and Airservices Australia in May 2005. Project Genesis was established in December 2005 as an outcome of the IOC to assess and manage reform proposals that contribute to the strategic vision of a single national system for air traffic management in Australia.Airservices Australia has allocated three staff to work on Project Genesis. Additional staff will provide support to the joint working groups on a non-permanent basis.The ADF has appointed two officers to work on Project Genesis. Additional ADF staff will provide support to the joint working groups on a non-permanent basis.The original timeline for relocating RAAF Pearce radar services into the Airservices Australia Perth Terminal Control Unit was based on a joint feasibility study that indicated the relocation could be completed by the end of March 2006. This timeline was agreed by the CEO of Airservices Australia and the Deputy Chief of Air Force, but has since been extended to early June 2006 (due to Defence training requirements).The relocation of Darwin and Tindal Approach services into the Airservices Brisbane Centre is tentatively planned for completion by end of 2006; however engineering assessments and a review of the business case may change this timeline. Project Genesis will submit a proposal and business case to CEO Airservices and Deputy Chief of Air Force for their consideration by mid-April 2006. The project delivery date will then be formalised and approved before further progression of this initiative.Project Genesis will identify areas where changes in airspace management or the provision of air traffic management services will produce operational and economic benefits for the ADF, Airservices Australia, the civil aviation industry and national security. In addition, airspace initiatives such as flexible use of airspace and special use airspace are being jointly pursued outside Project Genesis.The primary focus of Project Genesis is the delivery of a whole-of-government system for air traffic management in Australia that enhances national security. Closer relations between the ADF and Airservices Australia, including possible resource savings, will be an indirect consequence of developing improved business. The extent of any savings cannot be quantified at this early stage and some savings may not be realised until Project Genesis reaches maturity over the next five to ten years.</DOC>

Medibank Private Limited (Medibank) advises that the decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre to Elanora on 16 December 2005 was a business decision of the Medibank Board based on the advice of senior management.Medibank advises that prior to its decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre, Medibank conducted a review of the centre which showed that: customer volumes were low and declining; on average, Tweed Heads was processing 40-50% less than other retail centres; and new membership sales were negligible.Medibank advises that it regularly reviews its retail centre network to ensure that resources and capital are invested into the most effective and responsible retail centre network for members.Medibank advises that as it operates in a competitive industry, providing detailed customer information would be prejudicial to its commercial interests.Medibank advises that as it operates in a competitive industry, providing detailed customer information would be prejudicial to its commercial interests. However, when deciding on locations for retail centres, ensuring member access and therefore maximising the efficiency of the network, are paramount in the considerations.Medibank advises that it carefully considered the needs of Tweed Heads residents prior to deciding to relocate the retail centre. Taking into account Medibank's review of the Tweed Heads retail centre (answer 2 above refers), a number of sites were considered for the new location before The Pines Shopping Centre at Elanora was selected. Factors in favour of Elanora included its proximity to major roads and transport links, and the location of a Medicare outlet at the shopping centre.Medibank advises that it does operate off-line agencies in some locations. However, as the agencies do not have access to Medibank systems, the services offered are restricted. Given that the nearby Elanora branch (12km away) would be offering the full range of services and serves the same catchment area, the opening of an off-line agency was not deemed to be an efficient use of member contributions.Medibank advises that in response to the decision to relocate the Tweed Heads retail centre to Elanora, Medibank undertook an extensive member information campaign which included:- 3,915 letters advising of the change were sent to area members likely to be affected and informing of alternatives to the in-store services;- posters advertising the change were posted one week before closure of the retail centre. Difficulties in precisely identifying the date of opening at Elanora prevented a longer poster campaign; and- press advertisements advising of the Elanora location were run in the Gold Coast Bulletin in the weeks following the move.Medibank Private is currently engaged in sponsorship arrangements as listed below. Medibank advises that as it operates in a competitive industry providing detailed financial information on these sponsorships would be prejudicial to its commercial interests.

The sole criterion for eligibility for insulation of residential properties under the Adelaide Airport Noise Insulation Program (AANIP) is whether they are within the 30 - noise exposure contour, as measured under the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) system. None of the residences referred to are located within the 30-noise exposure contour and therefore are not eligible for insulation. Residents at these locations are being treated no differently to many other residents located close to the boundaries. It would be inequitable to other similarly placed residents to make an exception.Eligibility for inclusion under the Program is based on the ANEF system as updated by the annual Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI) maps. The ANEF system takes into account the numbers and types of aircraft, their flight paths and noise characteristics and the time of day of their operation. The ANEF system does not reflect a property's proximity to the airport boundary, but its proximity to the flight paths. Residents within the 30-noise exposure contour are affected worst by aircraft noise and it is these residents that have been targeted by the AANIP program.The ANEI maps used by the AANIP are created independently from the AANIP program and are already available publicly from Airservices Australia. The ANEI maps are prepared using actual flight tracks for aircraft operating during the 12 month period as recorded in Airservices Australia's Noise and Flightpath Monitoring System.I acknowledge that residents who live close to the airport itself, while not directly under the flight paths, can be impacted by aircraft noise and am sensitive to their concerns. For a program such as the AANIP however, a boundary must be drawn somewhere and applied fairly and consistently. I am not able to offer these residents special consideration.</DOC>

Yes.No. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has appropriate legislation to conduct operations to assist in emergency management and there is no intention to review or amend this legislation.The current legislative coverage provides appropriate protection for the ADF to conduct operations in support of disaster relief or in the event of a pandemic.There are established procedures for the utilisation of the ADF in times of natural disasters or pandemics as outlined in the Defence Assistance to the Civil Community (DACC) legislation. DACC enables the provision of Defence resources, in response to a request for assistance, for the performance of tasks that are primarily the responsibility of the civil community or other government organisations. Category 2 DACC assistance is emergency assistance where action is necessary to save human life or alleviate suffering or prevent extensive loss of animal life, and is appropriate for providing support to disaster relief. Conversely, call out under Part IIIAAA (Defence Force Aid to the Civil Authorities) is for the provision of aid in the event of domestic violence, and where civil authorities cannot resolve the incident. Call out is designed primarily for a counter-terrorism scenario.In regard to 'other preparations', this question should be directed to the Attorney-General.In regard to joint training between civil and military agencies, the ADF has a well established relationship with Emergency Management Australia for the provision of assistance under Defence Aid to the Civil Community arrangements. These procedures have proven to be effective on many occasions including in response to floods, bushfires and cyclones and, in particular, the joint civil and military response to the Bali bombings in both 2002 and 2005. The ADF is contributing to a whole-of-government planning for a potential pandemic and will respond as required by the Government.</DOC>

Worthington Di Marzio has been engaged by the ARC to conduct research to evaluate: (i) stakeholder satisfaction with aspects of the ARC's National Competitive Grants Program (NCGP), including the effectiveness of the ARC's delivery and management of the Program; and (ii) the level of community awareness of the ARC and its activities. The total cost of both elements of the research is $166,925.The research is considered necessary to enable the ARC to meet its responsibilities under the Australian Research Council Act 2001 in relation to performance reporting. Of the ten key performance indicators identified in the ARC's strategic plan, two relate to stakeholder satisfaction as follows:- Stakeholder satisfaction with the flexibility and responsiveness of the NCGP and with ARC processes for administering grants and applications; and- Enhanced stakeholder awareness of and satisfaction with the outcomes of ARC-funded research.The research will also enable the ARC to:- identify areas in which adjustments to the NCGP could be considered to better meet the needs of stakeholders;- identify areas in which management of the NCGP could be improved; and- conduct better targeted and more effective communications activities.and (c) The evaluation of stakeholder satisfaction with the NCGP involves 50 face-to-face and 400 telephone interviews with stakeholders. The evaluation of community awareness involves 14 focus group discussions and 600 telephone interviews.</DOC>

The Commonwealth has responsibility for control of sea dumping in Australian waters.Commonwealth interest involves co-operation with the States to develop strategic approaches to ensure the management and protection of Australia's marine and coastal environment.'The Minister has had informal discussions with many people.Policy development on coastal protection is continuing. Decisions on the nature, content and timing of any information regarding further policy development will be considered as part of that process.</DOC>

As at 13 February 2006, there were 24 AWA Ambassadors.AWA Ambassadors are employers who have implemented AWAs, or employees who have been employed under an AWA, and who are willing to explain publicly the advantages flowing from the use of AWAs. AWA Ambassadors are sourced from a wide range of industries and locations. Potential Ambassadors may be identified by OEA regional offices, industry partners or associates, or via an expression of interest from the company or individual interested in becoming an AWA Ambassador.Prior to a formal invitation being made to a potential ambassador, the OEA conducts pre-approval checks including:- identification of the potential promotional benefits the company or individual would bring to the program - for example, innovative AWA conditions;- analysis of previous lodgements of AWAs by the company to ensure they typically meet all the relevant statutory requirements; and- a check to ensure there are no unresolved compliance issues.After all pre-approval checks have been satisfied, the OEA contacts the potential ambassador to discuss the objectives of the program. Once the potential ambassador agrees to participate, they are referred to the Deputy Employment Advocate, Client Services for formal approval. The organisation or individual is then invited formally to become an AWA Ambassador.An AWA Ambassador is an employer and/or an employee who can speak about his/her AWA experiences, and who has been appointed in writing as an AWA Ambassador by the Deputy Employment Advocate, Client Services.One of the selection criteria for becoming an AWA Ambassador is that the OEA can be assured that the employer has a sound history of lodging AWAs that meet the No-Disadvantage Test. AWA Ambassadors must be well-established users of AWAs, and they exhibit the following characteristics:- ability to identify and communicate the benefits of their AWAs;- commitment to better workplace relations;- willingness to work productively with the OEA to promote agreement-making;- genuine commitment to AWAs by employees;- willingness for the company and/or the employee to be publicised;- willingness for the OEA to use information about their experience with AWAs in relevant OEA and external publications;- no unresolved complaints regarding AWAs; and- commitment to meeting their obligations under the Workplace Relations Act.AWA Ambassadors receive no remuneration from the OEA.The status of AWA Ambassadors is now reviewed every twelve months to ensure that the criteria for participation continue to be met.</DOC>

If a veteran requires a Booked Car with Driver (BCWD), then their health provider contacts the Department to certify that such transport is medically required and the Department then arranges the transport. BCWD can only be provided to specific treatment locations.Notwithstanding this procedure, the Department understands that some veterans may have been contacting the taxi /hire car companies directly to arrange their own BCWD transport without their health provider certifying the medical need. Some of the veterans who arranged their own transport were arranging it to a non-approved BCWD location. When the Department became aware of these non standard arrangements it has brought them back into line with the standard procedures.Transport services to local medical officers, allied health providers and imaging centres have not been suspended. Where a veteran needs to attend one of these health providers they can submit a claim for reimbursement of the costs involved either through the use of their private vehicle or using a taxi. If a taxi is used, the health provider must certify on the claim form that this mode of transport is medically necessary.There has been no change to the way in which the D800 'Claim for Travelling Expenses' form is completed. Assistance from the Department's Veterans Affairs Network (VAN) is available for veterans, war widows and war widowers (veterans) suffering from blindness or failing eyesight. Arrangements are in place for a VAN office to contact a veteran's neighbour, health provider or Ex-Service Organisations if it is determined that assistance is required in completing the D800 form.</DOC>

ESOs seeking assistance for the costs of postage and envelopes for their advocates and welfare officers may apply for a grant under the Building Excellence in Support and Training (BEST) Program. The BEST Program includes funding for running costs and general costs, including stationery and postage, to support ESOs in their advocacy and welfare work with the veteran community.The Minister is aware that veterans' organisations meet the costs of purchasing stationery and postage when submitting veterans' pension applications, which is consistent with the availability to ESOs of government funding for these items, under the BEST Program.</DOC>

Yes.I have called repeatedly for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Burma. The Australian Ambassador in Rangoon also frequently makes similar points to Burmese authorities, including to Burmese ministers and officials.Yes, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not undertaken prison visits in Burma since late 2005. Negotiations between the ICRC and Burmese authorities are continuing in an effort to resume the visits.The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights estimates that there are currently 1,144 political prisoners in Burma. The ICRC and other NGOs provide reports on prison conditions, and we have, along with other donor countries, contributed financially towards supporting the work of the ICRC in Burma including to assess the treatment and conditions, to provide basic health and hygiene supplies and to enable prisoners to re-establish and maintain family links.Over the past twelve months the Government has made formal representations on at least ten occasions, including at the highest level, urging the Burmese regime to address human rights and to release all political prisoners in Burma.</DOC>

I am aware of the protest and the dismissal of editors of some other newspapers, but not of any specific consequences that have resulted from the protest of the former senior officials.Their names (according to media sources) are as follows, with their positions where my department has been able to determine them. I am not aware of any retribution against any of the signatories.Jiang Ping  -  former Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress and former president of China University of Political Science and LawZhu Houze  -  former Head of the Central Publicity DepartmentLi Rui  -  former Secretary to Mao ZedongLi Pu  -  former Vice President of the China News AgencyHe JiadongHe Fang  -  former Head of China Youth Daily groupDai HuangShao YanxiangPeng DiHu Jiwei  -  former Editor-in-Chief of the People's DailyZhong PeizhangWu XiangZhang Sizhi  -  lawyerThe Government supports freedom of expression, and has called on China to guarantee freedom of expression, including press freedom.My department has raised the issue of press censorship.Most recently at our bilateral human rights dialogue on 27 June 2005.The issue was raised with then Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Shen Guofang, and his accompanying delegation, which included:- China's Special Representative on Human Rights, Ministry of Foreign Affairs- the Chief Judge of the Supreme People's Court- and officials from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Chinese Communist Party United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Public Security, and the All-China Women's Federation.The Chinese responded that China's Constitution protects the right of free speech and freedom of the press. They noted that China was second only to the United States in terms of internet use, and that many citizens used the internet to express their views on steps taken by the Government.The next round of our bilateral human rights dialogue is scheduled for the week beginning 24 July. The specific agenda will be decided closer to that time. Press freedoms, including the use of the internet, are issues indispensable to discussions on civil and political rights at the dialogues.</DOC>

The battles fought in Papua New Guinea against Japanese forces in 1942 were of great significance to Australia. In the early months of the year, Port Moresby was defended by the Army and a RAAF fighter squadron. In July, the Japanese forces landed on the north Papuan coast and advanced against determined Australian opposition across the Owen Stanley Range along the Kokoda Track. The battle of the Kokoda Track, which lasted from July to early November 1942, saw the enemy thrust back, with great loss, to defensive positions on the north Papuan coast beyond the Kumusi River. The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History calls the battle over the Kokoda Track 'an important battle because it defeated an enemy offensive which, had it been successful, would have altered the strategic situation in the SW Pacific'. But the campaign was not over. Battles were fought at Buna, Gona and Sanananda where the Japanese force had retreated to their original beachheads and occupied strongholds. The battles are known as the Battle of the Beachheads. Intensive fighting lasted from late November 1942 until the middle of January 1943. Australian and American troops fought with bravery and determination, incurring extremely heavy casualties. They completed the job, begun on the Kokoda Track and at Milne Bay, of driving the Japanese out of the Territory of Papua, as this area of Papua New Guinea was then known.Yes. During the initial fighting withdrawal towards Port Moresby and the eventual offensive, Australian forces lost about 625 killed and 1 055 wounded, figures roughly similar to the Syrian campaign of 1941. The efforts to drive the Japanese from the north coast between late November 1942 and the end of January 1943 were even more costly, costing approximately 1 300 Australian lives and nearly as many American lives. The direct threat to Port Moresby had now passed; however, fighting continued in Papua New Guinea until the surrender in 1945.The Prime Minister attended the dedication of the Isurava Memorial on the Kokoda Track in August 2002. In November 2002, the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon Danna Vale MP, attended the dedication of the redeveloped Popondetta Memorial which commemorates the Battle of the Beachheads, and the dedication of the Milne Bay Memorial. There have been visits in earlier years by Prime Ministers and Ministers for Veterans' Affairs.No. Forty seven battle names, broadly representative of all Australian battles in World War I and World War II, are inscribed on the Australian War Memorial, London. The final selection was the result of consultation with military historians, from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Australian War Memorial and the three Services. The battles in Papua New Guinea are represented by Bismarck Sea, Bougainville, Coral Sea, Kokoda, Markham-Ramu, Milne Bay, Rabaul and Wewak.Each Australian serviceman and woman who died is individually commemorated in Commonwealth War Graves Commission War Cemeteries in Papua New Guinea. The three war cemeteries in PNG at Bomana (Port Moresby), Lae and Rabaul are maintained by the Australian Government through the Office of Australian War Graves. Each grave is marked with an individual headstone, and the names of the missing servicemen are listed in the Memorials to the Missing located within the war cemeteries.They are also officially commemorated at the Australian War Memorial.</DOC>

I can confirm that my department is responsible for leading negotiations with the United States Government on an Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology for Homeland/Domestic Security Matters.Representatives from the United States Department of Homeland Security visited Australia in August 2004. As a result of this visit the US Government and my department have actively engaged to progress an agreement.The proposed agreement will be at the treaty level.The purpose of the agreement is to establish a framework to encourage, develop and facilitate bilateral cooperative activities in science and technology that contribute to the domestic security capabilities of both nations. The agreement will facilitate cooperative activities such as collaborative research, staff visits and information and material exchange that will contribute to the enhancement of domestic security capabilities of both nations.Negotiations have been completed. The agreement was signed in Washington on 21 December 2005 by the Australian Ambassador to the United States of America, Mr Dennis Richardson and the Secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, Mr Michael Chertoff.My department will be responsible for implementing the agreement in Australia while I understand that the Department of Homeland Security will be implementing the agreement in the US.The agreement has the necessary provisions governing the exchange of classified information.There are no direct financial obligations on the government that result from the agreement. However, the agreement provides the opportunity for the co-funding of collaborative research projects with the United States.The Government is open to opportunities for establishing similar agreements with other governments but there have been no formal approaches at this stage.</DOC>

The objective or national goal of the Coastcare Programme is to protect our coastal catchments, ecosystems and the marine environment.In seeking to achieve the objective, ten national priority areas of activity have been identified for the Natural Heritage Trust in general, and Coastcare specifically. These priorities guide the selection of projects to be funded at the national and local level, are included in the bilateral agreements with each state and territory, and form the basis of targeted investment through regional natural resource management plans and investment strategies.Activities that contribute to achieving Coastcare outcomes are funded through all three Natural Heritage Trust investment streams (national, regional and local) and collectively contribute to all ten of the Natural Heritage Trust investment priority areas of activity.The Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council also identified ten resource condition matters for target that regional bodies consider when developing specific targets for regional plans. Activities to achieve these regional targets are identified in regional investment strategies. Coastcare activities funded through the regional investment stream contribute to achieving targets set by the regional bodies and, at the same time, collectively contribute to national achievements in relation to the matters for target.Coastcare activities contribute to most of the ten matters for target. In coastal catchments, activities that maintain and improve land, river and biodiversity condition up-stream can contribute significantly to estuarine, coastal and marine habitat integrity down-stream.Coastcare activities also address the three key themes of the Natural Heritage Trust: conserving biodiversity; implementing sustainable agriculture and natural resource use; and building capacity and institutional change. Coastcare activities often focus on biodiversity conservation and community capacity building. Sustainable agriculture activities up-stream in coastal catchments can improve the condition of estuarine, coastal and marine habitats and ecosystems down-stream.Coastcare local level delivery is funded through the Australian Government Envirofund, which supports community groups and individuals to undertake small projects, valued up to $50,000, to target local problems.Further information can be found at the Natural Heritage Trust website www.nht.gov.au.In June 2002 the Natural Heritage Ministerial Board approved indicative programme allocations under the Trust for 2002-03 to 2006-07 based on 13% for Coastcare. In 2003-04, $36 million was expended on Coastcare, which represents 14.4 per cent of the total Trust expenditure of $250 million.to (8) The 2003-04 Regional Programs Summary Report identifies regional investments approved under the Extension of the Trust from July 2002 to June 2004 for activities having primarily 'coastal, estuarine and marine' outcomes as follows: $670,067 in NSW, $959,525 in Western Australia, $1,241,665 in Victoria and $1,967,403 in Queensland.These figures referred to in Questions (5) to (8) are not indicative of total regional expenditure on Coastcare activities maintaining or improving the condition of estuarine, coastal and marine habitats and species in these states. Regional investment activities are typically developed to achieve multiple outcomes. In preparing the 2003-04 Regional Programs Summary Report, the approved allocation and expenditure for each activity was attributed to only one matter for target based on the primary intent of the activity. Activities with significant Coastcare outcomes were distributed against all of the matters for target: biodiversity targets (rivers and wetlands, native species, invasive species and native vegetation as well as coastal, estuarine and marine) and water quality targets (nutrients, turbidity, salinity) and occasionally land targets (soil condition, salinity).Up to June 2005, Western Australian regions were in the process of developing their regional natural resource management plans and investment strategies. A significant proportion of funds was required by the regions to undertake the required community consultation, capacity building and awareness raising. Under the Extension of the Trust from July 2002 to June 2004, $27.5 million was approved from the regional investment stream for expenditure in Western Australia, comprising $6.4 million of foundation funding, $18.5 million for priority actions, $1.4 million for state-wide and multi-regional activities and $1.2 million of regional competitive funds.The six regions in Western Australia now have accredited plans and approved investment strategies under the bilateral agreement with the Government of Western Australia. As a result, an increasing proportion of funds will be spent directly on addressing the matters for target.The two sites referred to are not indicative of the total number of sites where funding under the Extension of the Natural Heritage Trust has enabled monitoring of the condition of estuarine, coastal and marine habitats and species. In preparing the 2003-04 Regional Programs Summary Report, the outputs of any single activity were reported against only one matter for target based on the primary intent of the activity. Activities that include significant Coastcare outputs are distributed against other matters for targets such as water quality targets (nutrients, turbidity, salinity) and biodiversity targets (rivers and wetlands, native species, invasive species and native vegetation).The two sites referred to are in South Australia in the South East natural resource management region where coastal litter surveys were carried out. The monitoring was a small component of a South East region activity, which received $80,000 of Trust funding. The monitoring attracted additional investment from the local fishing industry and the South Australian Government. The monitoring output was reported against the 'estuarine, coastal and marine habitat integrity' matter for target. By enabling risks to be identified and assessed, the litter survey monitoring has guided engagement with professional and recreational fishers to change their fishing practices and contribute to the achievement of the regional resource condition target 'Maintain and improve the condition of marine and coastal resources until 2002 and beyond'.Volunteer groups are strongly engaged in the delivery of Coastcare. Some volunteer groups work closely with regional bodies to carry out Coastcare activities that form part of larger regional investment strategies activities. In some cases no funding would be given directly to the volunteer group. In cases where funding is provided to the volunteer group this would be a devolved grant and would not be routinely reported by the regional body. Most volunteer groups are involved in Coastcare through Australian Government Envirofund projects. Under the Extension of the Natural Heritage Trust, the Envirofund has funded over three hundred small Coastcare projects with proponents who have self-identified as either a 'community group' or a 'non-government organisation'. Volunteer groups occur in both categories and funding and resources are not readily identifiable.Across Australia, coastal management committees are constituted in a variety of ways including being publicly elected committees or bodies established by local government or a state government department or agency. Similarly to the volunteer groups discussed in the response to Question (11) above, coastal management committees may work with regional bodies to deliver elements of the regional investment strategy or may receive small grants through the Australian Government Envirofund where they may self-identify as a 'community group' or a 'non-government organisation' or be sponsored by an organisation in another category. Funding and resources to coastal management committees is not readily identifiable.</DOC>

There are three Commonwealth owned vacant properties under the Education, Science and Training portfolio which are not utilised and are not let out. Two are Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) staff houses located in Port Hedland. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) has space in Australia House, London which is currently vacant.One of the DEST staff houses in Port Hedland has been vacant since March 2005, the other since May 2005. The houses have been left vacant as a result of staffing changes.The ANSTO space in Australia House has been unused since October 2003, when the last Counsellor returned to Australia. The lease runs to 30 June 2008. There has been no interest from other Australian Government agencies to take over the lease, and security reasons prevent sub-leasing to a non-Australian Government tenant.</DOC>

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has provided the following information in response to the question:The Isaacs Review started in the first week of February 2004, with all fieldwork, and processing of objections, completed by early July 2004.The Review was conducted primarily through personal visits to households in the division. Follow-up activities for those addresses where electors could not be contacted during those visits, and for establishments such as caravan parks, were conducted by mail.49,507 enrollable addresses were contacted by door knock during the Review; this represented just over 91 per cent of the 54,713 enrollable addresses in Isaacs. The remaining addresses (just under 9 per cent) were contacted by mail.The AEC defines the accuracy of electors' information as the percentage of current electors who are enrolled for the address at which they are living; that is, their enrolments were correct at the time of the Review. As reported, using this definition the Review confirmed that 89.17 per cent of the electors on the Isaacs roll were living at their enrolled address.Of the remaining 10.83 per cent of electors, 6,462 (7.24 per cent) were found to have left their enrolled address in the division and action was taken to transfer these electors to their new address in another division, if this was known, or remove them from the roll, if not. A further 3,174 electors (3.56 per cent) had some change to their enrolment details but remained within the division and the Review identified 14 deaths.</DOC>

Sightings of vessels potentially fishing illegally are reported to the Coastwatch National Surveillance Centre (NSC) primarily by Customs or Australian Defence Force (ADF) aerial surveillance assets, but also by private vessels and members of the public. Officers in the NSC contact relevant agencies to advise them of the sighting and, where appropriate, to seek the agency's requirement for any further action.The following Commonwealth agencies are primarily involved in relation to this activity, although other agencies may also become involved depending on the circumstances of the individual Foreign Fishing Vessel (FFV): the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Fisheries Management Agency, the Department of Defence, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; the Department of the Environment and Heritage, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.The Joint Offshore Protection Command (JOPC) comprises resources drawn from Customs and Defence. Coastwatch is a division of Customs and receives its resources through Customs budgetary processes. Each of the agencies identified in part (1) contributes to the Civil Maritime Surveillance Program (CMSP) through the provision of relevant intelligence and information which informs the Coastwatch Risk Assessment Methodology, and by membership of, and contributions to, the CMSP operational and strategic planning committees.and (b)      The Navy's Fremantle Class Patrol Boats are being replaced with more capable Armidale Class Patrol Boats. The vessels are being built in Western Australia and will be based at Darwin and Cairns. Darwin-based patrol boats will be forward deployed to Dampier with the support of a Navy logistics unit based at Dampier.Yes.See my response to Question on Notice No. 1223, published in the House of Representatives Hansard on 9 August 2005.Illegal fishing boats have at times conducted fishing operations within areas of shallow, uncharted or inadequately surveyed water. The circumstances present some challenges to both Navy patrol boats and Customs vessels. Subject to distances involved, rigid inflatable boats can be deployed to search for and apprehend vessels that enter these areas.Yes. Assessments have been undertaken to ascertain the threat posed by these vessels.The Navy Fremantle Class Patrol Boats are being replaced by the more capable Armidale patrol boats, and the Government has announced that an additional two Armidale patrol boats will be purchased to further strengthen our capabilities against illegal activity in our northern waters.Additionally, on 11 October 2005, the Government announced it would increase funding to Customs by $57 million over four years to boost its ability to manage FFVs and crews detained in northern Australian waters.The funding will enable Customs to employ an additional 34 Customs officers and purchase four new tactical medium response vessels. The additional vessels will take over responsibility for apprehended fishing boats from Customs or Navy patrol vessels as they near port. This will allow the larger Customs and Navy vessels to return more quickly to their patrol and response activities.Measures to combat illegal fishing activity have been effective in apprehending record numbers of FFVs in 2005.Defence works closely with relevant central agencies with responsibility for developing policy and strategic options to combat illegal fishing activities in northern Australia. Additionally, under the auspices of the JOPC, Defence works closely with Coastwatch to continuously review the deployment of operational air and surface assets of both agencies to ensure their optimum use.Defence works closely and cooperatively with each of the agencies identified in part (1).</DOC>

The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has provided the following information in response to the question.The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) undertook data analysis to identify the factors that influenced the increase in informal voting from 4.82% (580,590 out of 12,054,664) of votes cast for the House of Representatives from the 2001 election to 5.18% (639,851 out of 12,354,983) of votes at the 2004 election. This analysis is outlined in the AEC Research Report No 7, October 2005, which is available from the AEC website at www.aec.gov.au.The AEC provided a copy of this report to the former Special Minister of State for information and consideration. No formal Government response is proposed. However, I have noted the key findings of the Report that:a. there was a significant increase in the percentage of ballots made informal by marks and scribbles. If the informality level in this category had not increased in 2004, overall informality would have stayed at 2001 levels;b. the strongest predictor of a rise in informality in any Division is an increase in the number of candidates on the ballot paper;c. ballots that are informal because the elector has marked 'Number 1 only' or marked non - sequential preferences make up almost 50% of overall informality in all states and territories; andd. the 10 divisions with the highest informality levels were part of the 27 divisions nationally with the highest non-English speaking background levels. This has been an issue identified in the last two federal elections.The Report also highlighted that the differences in the voting systems between the states and territories, and in the ways ballots are deemed informal in those systems continues to impact on informality at the federal level. Levels of ballots marked with 'Number 1 only' remained high in New South Wales and Queensland in the 2001 and 2004 elections. Both of these states have optional preferential voting for state elections.The AEC has undertaken further analysis into the predictors of informality through two other studies  -  Analysis of Informality in Werriwa during the 2005 By-Election, and A Pilot Project on Informality in Port Adelaide. The outcome of these studies is being published in AEC Research Papers Numbers 8 and 9 on the AEC website in March 2006. Both of these Divisions have relatively high levels of informality and a high percentage of electors from non-English speaking backgrounds.The AEC's comparative analysis of informal voting at the 2004 federal election and the Werriwa by - election, held in March 2005, indicates that in addition to the different voting arrangements for the House of Representatives and the Senate, the way in which information is presented on 'how to vote' cards, and the order in which the elector completes their ballot papers when Senate and House of Representatives elections are held concurrently, are factors influencing the level of informality. The Pilot study of the Division of Port Adelaide found that while there was a correlation between electors from non-English speaking backgrounds and informality rates, the correlations exist only with certain communities of non-English speaking electors. There is a need for a more targeted approach to elector information campaigns.The AEC has had preliminary discussions on its research findings into informality with the secretariats of the major political parties and the former Chair of the Joint Senate Committee on Electoral Matters. In the coming months the AEC will be further engaging with stakeholders to develop strategies aimed at reducing the rate of informality where possible.I note that analysis of informal voting by electorate, however, indicates that local factors can also have a significant impact. Targeting electors in electorates that are at risk of a high informal vote could be very effective. I have asked the AEC to keep me informed of its progress in developing more targeted public awareness campaigns to reduce informality.</DOC>

CSA is not able to provide the requested data by electorate as this is not the way in which it collects administrative data on customers. I have, however, attached a table (available from the House of Representatives Table Office) that records the number of cases with debt in each postcode in Australia; the value of the debt for the years 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005.The table records the number of cases in each postcode that have debt for each of the three years specified. In many of the postcodes there has been a decline in the number of cases with debt. It is important to note, however, that there will be some cases that had debt in 2002-2003 that will not have had debt in 2003-2004 or 2004-2005. At the same time, there will be cases in the 2003-2004 or 2004-2005 years that have fallen into arrears that did not have debt in 2002-2003. In effect, cases will have come into the debt totals while others will have gone out because their debt has been enforced.With most clients the process used to collect debt will depend on the client's financial circumstances and arrangements, and their attitude to the payment of the outstanding Child Support.Further information on how CSA collects child support debts is available on CSA's website, www.csa.gov.au.CSA does not have performance bonuses associated with enforcement of debt. CSA does regularly report on its collection performance.</DOC>

and (b) During 2004-05, Defence spent $33m on external barristers and solicitors (including private firms, the Australian Government Solicitor and others). The department's accounting systems do not allow the figure to be broken down as barristers are retained by the external solicitors handling each matter on behalf of Defence. This figure includes disbursements and GST.During 2004-05, Defence spent $24.1m on internal legal services, which includes overheads and GST.Defence's projected expenditure on legal services in 2005-06 is $65.7m.

During the 2004-2005 financial year, the Attorney-General's Department spent:$1,132,391.92 (including GST) on external barristers, and$4,564,108.90 (including GST) on external solicitors including the Australian Government Solicitor and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.These figures exclude amounts of legal services expenditure relating to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance and international obligations under various bilateral maintenance arrangements. In 2004-05 expenditure on legal services for these matters was not recorded separately from expenditure on a range of other services provided in accordance with Australia's international obligations under the above Conventions, such as translation services.The Department does not have a separate legal services branch. Within the Department, there are units that provide both internal and external services, principally the Office of International Law, the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, and the Counsel assisting the Solicitor-General. Legal services are provided at no cost to the areas of the Department receiving the services. There is no billing arrangement for internal legal services and separate records are not kept about this expenditure. These expenses are treated as part of the aggregate of staffing costs for the Department.An estimate of the cost of internal legal services provided by officers of the Department to the Department in 2004-05 has been derived from an assessment of the number of staff involved in providing internal legal services and the proportion of their time involved in providing those services. The staff of the Office of International Law devoted to providing internal legal services are, approximately the full time equivalent of 0.5 of an APS3 level, 1.0 of a Legal Officer, 1.0 of a Senior Legal Officer, 1.0 of a Principal Legal Officer and 0.5 of an SES Officer. The staff of the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing devoted to providing internal legal services are the full time equivalent of 0.2 of a Legal Officer, 1.0 of a Senior Legal Officer, 0.3 of a Principal Legal Officer and 0.1 of an SES Officer. Approximately 50% of the time of the Counsel assisting the Solicitor - General (a Principal Legal Officer) is devoted to providing legal services to the Department.The cost of internal legal services was then estimated based on salary levels for these positions and increased by a factor reflecting typical staffing and other overheads within the Department.By this method, it is estimated that approximately $0.95 million was spent on internal legal services by the Department in 2004 - 05 and approximately $0.99 million is expected to be spent in 2005-06.In addition, the costs of the Solicitor-General (including salary) are met by the Department.The budgeted amount for outsourced legal services in 2005-06 is $6.3 million.</DOC>

The Workplace Relation Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (the Work Choices Act) will create a workplace relations system that promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia by giving employers and employees the flexibility to negotiate agreements that suit their particular circumstances.Agreement making, whether collective or individual, has consistently delivered better wage outcomes than other industrial instruments. The Government believes that the Work Choices Act will deliver better wage rises to employees because agreement making will be easier.In addition, employees negotiating an agreement cannot be paid less than their relevant Australian Pay and Classification Scale (APCS). APCSs are based on classification pay scales contained in awards as varied to reflect the 2005 Safety Net Review. Rates of pay cannot fall below this level.No. All employees, regardless of the size of business they are employed in, continue to have access to unlawful termination provisions. In addition, the Australian Government will provide $5 million for a 'best practice' education and training programme on fair and proper employment termination practices to help employers to understand and comply with the termination of employment provisions under the Act.No. The Work Choices Act provides specific protections for vulnerable workers in agreement making.All employees will be entitled to appoint a bargaining agent to act on their behalf in agreement making. For collective agreement making, if an employee is concerned about being seen to appoint a bargaining agent, they can do so through the Employment Advocate, and their identity will remain a secret.When employees are provided with ready access to a proposed agreement, the employer must also provide an Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA) information statement. The OEA information will contain information about how to obtain advice from the OEA. The OEA also provides a free service to explain the content of agreements to an employee or potential employee.There are also specific protections for employees under the age of 18 who are negotiating an Australian Workplace Agreement (AWA). An AWA for an employee under the age of 18 cannot be lodged unless it is signed and dated by an appropriate person (such as a parent or guardian) for the purpose of ensuring that person gives consent for the employee to make the AWA.In addition, broader protections for vulnerable workers will be maintained, including protection against discrimination. Specific provisions also relate to persons from a non English speaking background, young people and to contract outworkers in the Victorian textile, clothing and footwear industries.Finally, the Government is significantly expanding the Office of Workplace Services to provide protection and enforcement for the rights of all employees, including vulnerable employee.The Work Choices Act will for the first time enshrine in law a set of minimum conditions of employment called the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard (the Standard). No employee who is part of the national system will be able to receive less than the Standard. See also the response to question 3.The Australian Fair Pay Commission (Fair Pay Commission) will be appointed by the Governor-General on advice from the Government. The Government does not believe this will jeopardise the objectivity of the Fair Pay Commission.It is standard practice for the Governor-General to make appointments to statutory bodies like the Fair Pay Commission on advice of the Government. Members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) are and will continue to be appointed in this way. In other words, the Fair Pay Commission will be appointed in the same way as members of the AIRC are appointed.The Fair Pay Commission will operate independently of Ministerial control and be guided in its work by the requirements of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Decisions of the Fair Pay Commission cannot be overturned. The Fair Pay Commission will be supported by a secretariat that is an independent statutory authority that will operate independently of Ministerial control.The Work Choices Act will serve Australia's social goals by providing a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</DOC>

ONA produces classified assessments on a wide range of terrorism-related issues. Consistent with the practice of successive Australian Governments, it would not be appropriate to comment publicly on judgements contained in these classified assessments.ONA's practice has been not to list the precise topics on which it produces classified assessments since to do so may reveal details of Australia's intelligence interests. My office receives all ONA assessments.The Leader of the Opposition is briefed on key issues affecting national security.</DOC>

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaCSIA) has not withheld funding from Fairfield Community Aid and Information Service (FCA). FCA did not accept the funding offer for the 2005-06 financial year. The offer lapsed after 20 days. Upon further consideration and investigation, FaCSIA determined to not make a further funding offer due to the operational and financial circumstances of FCA, and instead has publicly canvassed expressions of interest for alternative providers.Additional funding of $40,000 was provided to The Salvation Army (NSW) Property Trust for distribution through its Community Service Centre in Fairfield. The postal address for The Salvation Army (NSW) Property Trust is PO Box A435 Sydney South 1232.The department does not have access to information on FCA clients. Emergency relief funds are for one-off purposes and not for a specific or regular group of users. Clients are not expected to become dependent on regular or frequent assistance. The Government relies on emergency relief agencies to deal with their clients in a responsible manner. Centrelink was aware that FCA was not providing the service and was referring people needing emergency assistance to the Salvation Army outlet in Fairfield.My department has advertised for providers who are willing and able to provide a quality emergency relief service to the people of Fairfield.</DOC>

Active participants (Australian): 3; and (b) observers: 11Active participants: 4; and (b) observers: 6Australia is among the leading countries forging an increased role for renewable energy sources in meeting energy needs. Renewable energy was a key component of the inaugural Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate meeting, and is a key focus of Australia's involvement in the Partnership. For example, the Prime Minister's announcement of an Australian $100 million new funding contribution to support the work of the Asia-Pacific Partnership included a minimum $25 million to advance renewable energy projects. As well, Australia is co-chairing the renewable energy taskforce.to (6) Professor McKibbin makes a valuable contribution on issues around directions on market mechanisms to underpin future climate change responses.The Australian Government considers that introducing a carbon trading system that drives up electricity and fuel prices would not be environmentally effective. Without an effective global response to climate change, such action would harm Australia's competitiveness while delivering uncertain environmental benefits.Imposing new costs and taxes on production in Australia would only increase the cost of living for Australians  -  affecting low and middle income earners in particular as it would not only drive industry and jobs overseas, but also move greenhouse gas emissions offshore. It may make you feel good to constrain industry in Australia  -  but to shift emissions to a less-regulated jurisdiction does not help to reduce global greenhouse gas levels.The Asia-Pacific Partnership and the Australian Government's flagship climate change programs, such as the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund and the $75 million Solar Cities Trial, provide key platforms for advancing at this time the development of low emissions technologies needed to bring about the major reductions in greenhouse emissions over the longer term.The Government stated in its 2004 Energy White Paper that it is prepared to consider least-cost approaches to constraining emissions, including market-based measures such as an emissions trading scheme, as part of an effective global response to constraining greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

The OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (OECD Convention) was signed on 17 December 1997 and entered into force generally on 15 February 1999.Japan deposited its instrument of ratification for the OECD Convention on 13 October 1998 and the OECD Convention entered into force for Japan on 15 February 1999.The Republic of Korea deposited its instrument of ratification on 4 January 1999 and the OECD Convention entered into force for the Republic of Korea on 5 March 1999.New Zealand deposited its instrument of ratification on 25 June 2001 and the OECD Convention entered into force for New Zealand on 24 August 2001.Australia deposited its instrument of ratification on 18 October 1999 and the OECD Convention entered into force for Australia on 17 December 1999.I am not aware of specific occasions in which Australia has held discussions with other states about becoming party to the OECD Convention. All OECD members are party to the OECD Convention. While non-OECD members can accede to the OECD Convention, Australia has focussed on encouraging countries to become party to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).UNCAC largely supersedes the OECD Convention as it (a) incorporates key bribery obligations contained in the OECD Convention as well as broader anti-corruption obligations and (b) was negotiated in a UN forum with broader membership than the OECD. UNCAC entered into force on 14 December 2005 and has 140 signatories and 49 parties. Australia is actively encouraging Asia-Pacific countries to become party to UNCAC including through:-       membership of and support ($300,000) for the Asia Development Bank-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for the Asia-Pacific that includes 25 countries a members (see http://www1.oecd.org/daf/asiacom)-       providing $300,000 for the joint Australia-UN Office of Drugs and Crime -Thailand workshop (Bangkok, January 2006) to promote UNCAC ratification.</DOC>

and (2) The term 'Migrant Information Centre' is a name used only by the Migrant Information Centre of Eastern Melbourne (MICEM). It was established in 1998 to deliver migrant settlement services in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.The MICEM is a Migrant Service Agency (MSA). Although different in name, MSAs and Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) provide similar settlement services and receive core funding from the Australian Government. There are currently four MSAs and twenty-four MRCs funded to provide settlement services.Two of the MSAs, including the MICEM, were established as companies limited by guarantee on the recommendation of steering committees established to advise on the most appropriate model for the two agencies. The committees also recommended that the Board of Directors be appointed by the Minister.As noted in my previous answer above, Migrant Information Centres do not exist as discrete entities.</DOC>

Mr McGauran sought such advice in the context of briefing on his portfolio responsibilities.Mr McGauran sought such advice, again in the context of briefing early in his term of office.The advice referred to in (2) was provided to the former Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in November 2004. The Department has not provided this information to any other Minister in the past three years.The advice was provided by email, the relevant section of the email is attached.The Minister's Chief of Staff and the Minister's Adviser.ATTACHMENT QON 812 (3)(a)Relevant section of an email sent to the former Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs in November 2004.MRC appointment processYou also enquired about the possibility of having other MRCs change their constitution to allow the Minister to approve its Board nominations and appoint Board members directly (along the lines of the MIC).Most, if not all, MRCs are incorporated associations and their affairs are government by their Constitution. The Constitution (we have assumed that the Gippsland one is typical of all others) does not provide for any involvement of the Minister in the appointment process of members to the MRC committee of management. The Constitution does provide that Federal Government nominees may be co-opted to the committee of management as observers and or advisers but they will not have voting rights.For the Minister to have involvement in the appointment process of the MRC committee of management, the Constitution would have to be amended to include specific provisions providing for such involvement.It is possible that this requirement could be made a condition of continued Commonwealth funding on the basis that the Commonwealth through the Minister would like to have some involvement in the selection of the committee of management if it will be making decisions to spend funds provided by Commonwealth taxpayers. The question then would be whether this is a condition to be placed on one, several or all MRCs.If it were to be all MRCs, the Minister could write to MRC/MSAs requesting that they amend their constitutions to make provision for the Minister to have formal involvement in appointment processes. For example, this condition could be identified when we write to MRC/MSAs in requesting their bids for core funding for 2005-06. Should they decline funding could be denied. However, if organisations wanted to comply, we have been advised that enacting amendments to an organisation's constitution can be a lengthy and very public process. It would involve the calling of special meetings etc, and will attract attention and publicity. Denial of funding would also be seen as provocative.An alternative would be an informal approach on a one-to-one basis between Minister, the dept and the organisation.</DOC>

The Treasurer has referred this question to me as it falls within my ministerial responsibilities.An employee can report unpaid contributions to the Tax Office as the Commissioner of Taxation has the general administration of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (s 43). The Tax Office investigates all employee complaints of unpaid superannuation contributions.The Commissioner will raise a superannuation guarantee (SG) charge assessment if he is of the opinion that the employer is liable to pay the SG charge (and the employer has not lodged an SG statement). The Commissioner will also pursue payment of any unpaid SG charge assessment.An employee also has the ability to take action under Commonwealth or state workplace relations legislation to recover unpaid award superannuation contributions.Once an SG charge debit assessment issues there is no time limit for recovery of that debt.Superannuation funds and retirement savings account (RSA) providers are required to issue annual account statements to their members. Employees can identify non-payment of superannuation contributions when they receive their annual account statement and can ask their employer or superannuation fund at any time. Note, some superannuation funds and RSA providers issue statements more frequently and/or provide online access to accounts.From 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 10,439 cases were finalised where the Commissioner issued a debit SG charge assessment. These cases related to cases started in the 2004-2005 year and earlier years.The Commissioner undertakes audits of all employee notifications of non-payment of superannuation guarantee. However, this does not mean that there is necessarily a non-payment of superannuation contributions. This is only determined when an audit case is finalised and an employer is issued a debit SG Charge assessment.From 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, 13,154 new audit cases were commenced. Of these, 5,850 were finalised. It was determined that no further action was required on 2,632 cases as the employer had in fact complied with the law and a debit SG charge assessment was raised in 3,218 cases.In 627 cases identified from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, the debt SG charge raised has been collected in full.As at 30 June 2005, 7304 of the audit cases commenced were still being investigated and recovery action was still being undertaken in 2,591 cases where the audit action had been completed.No. The ATO is unable to advise employees when an employer is not fulfilling their superannuation obligations due to secrecy provisions in the SGAA (section 45). The answer to the second part of the question is no.The Government will give consideration to these matters.</DOC>

As at 1 March 2006, there were 5,020 Retirement Visa (subclass 410  -  Temporary) holders. It is estimated that the vast majority of these currently reside in Australia. A breakdown of these visa holders by Commonwealth electoral division, however, is not available.I am aware of proposals put to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) by Retirement visa holders that they be able to access permanent residence. The Chair of the Committee, Mr Don Randall MP wrote to me on 16 March 2005 seeking my agreement to conduct a short inquiry into 'Aged Parent and Retiree visas'. I replied on 19 April 2005 declining this request but indicated my willingness to consider issues relating to aged parent and retiree visas at a later date.</DOC>

and (3) For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the numbers of staff undergoing security clearance processes through Australian Government agencies.For reasons of security, the government does not comment on the length of time required to obtain a clearance.Factors impacting on security clearance timelines include:the degree of accurate completion and submission of supporting documents by the vetteethe availability and degree of cooperation of the vettee in providing further information, andthe timeliness of responses by other organisations and persons to requests for necessary information.Where a person's security clearance is yet to be finalised, Agency Heads have the discretion to implement interim temporary arrangements to enable a person to start in a position without a security clearance and without access to classified material. In those cases, continuing employment is contingent on a security clearance being obtained so that the full measure of the person's responsibilities can be carried out.</DOC>

Medical registration in Queensland is the responsibility of the Queensland State Government. The rules and regulations governing medical practitioners in Queensland are promulgated by Queensland legislation and the Queensland Medical Registration Board.The provision of public hospital services in Queensland is the responsibility of the Queensland State Government.In order to confirm the number of doctors working in Thuringowa's northern beaches, more specific information on the defined boundary of this area would be required.Thuringowa is a district of medical workforce shortage. Therefore, it is likely that an overseas trained doctor who was subject to Medicare provider number restrictions would be granted a provider number to work in this locality.Overseas trained doctors who enter Australia must meet certain quality standards in order to be registered to practise medicine. Medical registration is the responsibility of the states and territory governments and all doctors must be registered before they can provide clinical services.Under the auspices of the Strengthening Medicare package, the Commonwealth has been working with state and territory health departments, medical registration boards, and major medical stakeholders to develop nationally consistent principles for the assessment and supervision of temporary resident overseas trained doctors. On 10 February 2006 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to implement a national assessment process for overseas qualified doctors to ensure appropriate standards in qualifications and training, and to increase the efficiency of the assessment process.The Australian Government has made medical workforce a major focus of its $4 billion package for Strengthening Medicare. The range of initiatives contained in the Strengthening Medicare package have short, medium and long term objectives.Since 2000, the Australian Government has increased the number of publicly funded medical school places by more than 30%:It has supported the establishment of new medical schools at James Cook University and Griffith University in Queensland, the Australian National University in the Australian Capital Territory, and the University of Notre Dame in Western Australia.The government has also announced its support for the establishment of three new medical schools at the University of Western Sydney, the University of Wollongong and the University of Notre Dame in Sydney.In 2005, the Australian Government introduced new arrangements that allow medical schools to provide full fee paying places in medicine for Australian students. At that time, each school could offer an additional 10% of their publicly funded places as full fee paying places.On 10 February 2006, COAG agreed to increase the number of full fee paying domestic medical school places available annually. In addition to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) funded places, universities can now accept up to an additional 25% of the medical student load as full fee paying.As part of the Strengthening Medicare package, the government is implementing a range of other measures to increase medical workforce capacity including:More than 1,600 general practices are now being supported to employ practice nurses and all general practitioners can claim Medicare items for specific services undertaken by practice nurses;The number of appropriately qualified overseas trained doctors working in Australia is being increased through international recruitment strategies, reduced red tape in approval processes and changes to immigration arrangements;280 funded short term placements are being made available each year for junior doctors to work under supervision in general practices in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas;Refresher training courses and other support for general practitioners and specialists no longer practising medicine to help them return to the medical workforce;Higher Medicare rebates for services provided in areas of workforce shortage by doctors registered before 1996 who don't hold vocational registration;Greater support for rural general practitioners who provide procedural services like obstetrics and minor operations; andAdditional funding for doctors who provide care to patients in aged care facilities.</DOC>

In determining the location of the centres, the Attorney-General's Department analysed demographic information obtained through the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) along with information on the need for family services provided by the Department of Family and Community Services (now the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs). Factors taken into account were:populationproportion of divorced or separated people with childrenproportion with oldest child under 5 yrs oldthe number of blended familiesseparations in the last 6 months and the last 3 yearsChild Support Agency clientspeople receiving parenting paymentsDomestic Violence Hotline referralsthe accessibility of the proposed Family Relationship Centres to people elsewhere in the region, andthe location of the courts and Government funded services such as those under the Family Relationship Services Program, Indigenous services and community legal services and the distribution of other Government agencies such as Centrelink and the Job Network.The demographic information, in the form of raw data tables, was obtained through the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Department of Family and Community Services (now the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) provided input on the need for family services.The raw data tables, which were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were in the form of electronic 'Concord' spreadsheets for each State and Territory. Due to their large size and interactive features, it is not feasible to provide these spreadsheets in written form.In relation to the other data, the Attorney-General's Department relied on input by the Department of Family and Community Services (now the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs). The information that was provided to the Attorney - General's Department is available from the House of Representatives Table Office.The number of payers and payees in the child support system was considered by the Department of Family and Community Services (now the Department of Family, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) in providing advice to the Attorney-General's Department about the relative needs of various locations.However, the locations of the first 15 centres do not necessarily correspond to those areas having the highest numbers of people as clients of the child support system, as a number of factors indicating need were taken into account as shown in (1) above.</DOC>

Yes, I am aware of the report and its findings. Researchers at the Australian National University and the University of Sydney have been working with the AEC on the Youth Electoral Study (YES) project since May 2003.The study is a longitudinal one of young people aged 17  - 24 to identify attitudes and behaviours towards enrolment, voting and democratic engagement.The findings quoted in this question come from the second YES report released in October 2005; the first was released in December 2004.Yes. As stated in my answer to question (1), the YES project is a study of 17 to 24 year olds and the AEC is now focusing attention on young people at or near voting age.The Australian Electoral Commission has provided the following information in response to the question.and (4) The AEC is not withdrawing from the conduct of school-based elections. The AEC reviewed its electoral public awareness program in 2002-03 and decided to adopt a more targeted approach. This meant directing resources to specific areas such as young people at or near voting age, new citizens, people from non - English speaking backgrounds and indigenous voters.The AEC has recently reviewed that decision and, while assistance with school elections (and public awareness activities) will continue to be focused on secondary students near voting age, the AEC will provide election and education services to primary schools whenever possible. Where it is not possible for AEC staff to be involved directly in school elections, the AEC will continue to provide assistance in the form of voting and polling equipment. Obviously this assistance would be based on operational capacity.</DOC>

The guidelines for decision-makers in relation to deciding if a security bond is necessary and the amount of bond sought are to be found in the Department's Procedural Advice Manual 3. It is worth noting that the bonds can be paid by anyone and are not restricted to the applicant or the sponsor. In many cases it is the sponsor who pays when a bond is requested.If the evidence provided by the applicant and the sponsorship undertakings are sufficient to satisfy the decision maker that the visa applicant will abide by all of the conditions imposed on the visa then the visa will be granted without the imposition of a security bond.If the evidence and the sponsor's undertaking are not enough to satisfy the decision maker that the applicant will abide by their visa conditions, the decision maker may consider requesting a security bond. A security bond is only requested if, when considered in addition to the other evidence provided, lodging it would be enough to satisfy the decision maker that the applicant will comply with visa conditions and will leave Australia before their visa expires. It is requested after all other checks and clearances in respect of the visa application have been obtained.If requested, the security bond is set at a level sufficiently meaningful to encourage the visa holder to comply with the conditions of their visa and thereby satisfy the authorised officer that they intend a 'genuine visit'. Bonds are usually set at between $5,000 and $15,000 per applicant. However, depending on the circumstances determined by the delegate, the amount can be less than $5,000 or more than $15,000.</DOC>

The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal also consulted all ranks in considering matters before it.The results of these consultations were taken into account in arriving at recommendations and decisions.Proposals for remuneration and conditions of service are first considered by the Defence People Committee, and then by one or more of other Defence committees, the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, depending on the type of proposal. In 2004-05, a number of proposals on remuneration and conditions of service became policy and were promulgated widely.</DOC>

The Migration Regulations include a specific requirement that the applicant's 'proposed employment will comply with all relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation dealing with employment and working conditions of employment.' Persons recruited under the Trade Skills Training visa would therefore be expected to have the same core protections as Australian apprentices and will work under any awards and conditions applicable to the Government's New Apprenticeship Scheme.Minimum wages for apprentices under the new Work Choices system are protected at the level set after the inclusion of the increase from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's 2005 Safety Net Review case. These minimum wages are locked in and cannot fall below this level. The Australian Fair Pay Commission is empowered to increase these minimum wages if it so decides in the future.</DOC>

The Government, in response to the Productivity Commission's 2002 inquiry into airport price regulation, introduced price monitoring to provide greater scope for airports to price, invest and operate efficiently. The Government stated that the policy would be reviewed after five years to determine whether there have been unjustifiable price increases that warrant the reimposition of price controls (the Government's response is available on the Treasurer's website at www.treasurer.gov.au/tsr/content/pressreleases/2002/024.asp).The Government recently announced that the policy, which is due to expire on 30 June 2007, will be reviewed in 2006 by the Productivity Commission. The Commission will be asked to consider whether there have been any unjustifiable price increases and to make recommendations regarding the development of future regulatory arrangements.In addition, it should be noted that, under Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (which establishes a national regime to facilitate access to essential infrastructure services) all Australian airports are potentially subject to declaration. Declaration provides an access seeker with a legally enforceable right to negotiate access to that service on reasonable terms and conditions. For a service to be declared under Part IIIA, the designated minister must be satisfied of all of the matters listed in section 44H(2). Where commercial agreement cannot be concluded in relation to the terms and conditions of access to a declared service, the parties have recourse to the ACCC for arbitration.</DOC>

Yes.The ATO revised its estimate in November 2004 to $195 million, then in April 2005 to $205 million.In 2005 the ATO identified approximately 10.4 million work items relating to unquoted tax file numbers that had accumulated prior to June 2004 and an additional 800,000 that had accumulated during the course of the next financial year. During the second half of 2005 the ATO addressed around 10.4 million of these items. The majority of these work items did not result in a surcharge liability assessment. Of the residual 800,000 exceptions all but 18,000 are still awaiting attention. Plans are on track to finalise this work.The ATO has advised that 90% of the surcharge debt raised will be collected.</DOC>

This matter falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Treasurer.This matter falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Treasurer.The Government is actively pursuing a reform agenda to relieve small business of the burden of unnecessary regulation. Last year the Government cut red tape in a number of key areas including GST reporting, making AWA's, Superannuation Guarantee reporting and unfair dismissal laws. In October 2005, the Prime Minister appointed a Taskforce to identify practical options for reducing red tape on business, including small business. The Government is now considering the recommendations of the Taskforce.The Prime Minister and Treasurer also announced on 12 October 2005 new annual stocktakes of existing regulation, and more rigorous use within government of cost-benefit analysis of proposed regulation. In this regard, the Office of Small Business has developed a costing model to assist government agencies to cost the compliance burden of proposed regulations with the aim of keeping the burden to a minimum. The Government has endorsed the costing model for use on any proposals coming before it that have an impact on business. It is also recommended that the costing model be used for proposals coming forward as part of the Budget process.The Australian Government's www.business.gov.au website is an online resource, which provides, information and services electronically in a business-friendly manner to businesses so that they can more easily deal with the three tiers of government in Australia. Technology will continue to play a part in reducing business compliance costs. In December 2004, I launched the ABN Lookup tool, which allows businesses to undertake multiple searches of Australian Business Numbers. In November 2005, I launched Forms Manager, a valuable tool, which allows small business to download and save government forms directly to their personal or laptop computer to complete at their convenience.On 5 July 2005, I launched the Regulation Reduction Incentive Fund (RRIF), a competitive grants program to encourage local government to ease the regulatory burden on small business. In December 2005, I announced that Australia's 1.2 million small businesses will save an estimated $450 million through local government projects to cut compliance costs that we have funded from the $50 million RRIF.International studies have generally concluded that Australia's regulatory system performs well internationally. For example, a World Bank (2005) study Doing Business in 2006 considered the time and cost involved in over 155 countries in performing essential business activities (such as starting a business, hiring workers and enforcing contracts). This report rated Australia as sixth best.The 1999 Review of Business Taxation chaired by John Ralph anticipated that in a mature system around 60% of eligible businesses would take up the Simplified Tax System. At that time the ATO estimated that the system would take some 2 to 3 years after implementation to reach maturity. Further questions should be directed to the Treasurer, as this falls within his portfolio responsibilities.The Government is committed to reducing red tape for small business so they can concentrate on growth and job creation. For example, the Board of Taxation is currently undertaking, at the Government's instigation, a scoping study of small business tax compliance costs to identify areas where compliance costs can be reduced. The Board's consultation processes commenced in early 2006 and a final report will be provided to Government in the latter half of this year.Consultation with stakeholders is standard practice in the policy development process for new initiatives or programs. With regard to tax measures, the Department of the Treasury takes a number of different approaches to liaison and consultation depending upon the time available or the commercial and other sensitivities surrounding an issue. The ATO has various consultation processes and it has a program on making it easier to comply, which is aimed at reducing the compliance costs of businesses doing business with the ATO.There is insufficient data on this issue to provide a definitive answer. By way of context, as indicated previously, international studies have generally concluded that Australia's regulatory system performs well internationally. For example, a World Bank (2005) study Doing Business in 2006 considered the time and cost involved in over 155 countries in performing essential business activities (such as starting a business, hiring workers and enforcing contracts). This reported rated Australia as sixth best.Regulations at all levels of government, particularly the burden imposed by compliance processes, are the main source of red tape for the small business sector. Businesses have also raised concerns with the Office of Small Business about the implications of business-to-business red tape. It is often not a single regulation that causes problems for small business, but the cumulative burden of numerous regulations that a business has to deal with on a day to day basis.</DOC>

It is not possible to quantify in dollar terms the costs to small business of the WorkChoices reforms. However, any costs that may be incurred are expected to be minimal and are likely to be outweighed by the benefits that will be provided by the simplification of Australia's workplace relations system. For instance, small business will greatly benefit from the reforms to unfair dismissal laws and the replacement of the costly agreement approval processes with a simple lodgement process for all agreements. In addition WorkChoices will also restore protections from redundancy pay obligations for small businesses with 15 or less employees.An information and education campaign to promote and explain the workplace relations reforms to all Australian employees and employers, including small business, commenced following the proclamation of the WorkChoices legislation.See the response to Question 1. WorkChoices will not impose any new fees on small business. In fact, the Government has announced that from 1 July 2006 the upfront incorporation fee charged by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will be reduced from $800 to $400, at an estimated cost of $216.4 million over four years. This reduction in fees will assist small businesses wishing to incorporate and access the benefits of the WorkChoices system.No. The Office of the Employment Advocate will provide advice and assistance for employers and employees who wish to enter into an agreement.No. See also the response to Question 2 above.Questions on the tax deductibility of specific expenses should be directed to the Australian Taxation Office.WorkChoices provides employers and employees with choice as to the most appropriate form of agreement for their circumstances, whether that agreement is individual or collective. There is no requirement for small business to arrange individual contracts with their existing or new employees.and (9). No. As noted in the response to question 2, an information and education campaign will be undertaken to promote and explain the workplace relations reforms. The campaign will target small business, among other groups.I am aware of the survey. Other recent surveys have also explored this aspect of the WorkChoices reforms. For instance, the February 2006 Sensis Business Index  -  Small &amp; Medium Enterprises found that 'Of those small businesses intending to make changes as a result of the reforms, they are most likely to do this by hiring more staff.'As part of the WorkChoices information and education campaign, information will be made available through a number of sources including, seminars, fact sheets, a website and an information line. $7.31m has been provided through the 2005-06 Additional Estimates process, to deliver targeted information and education activities.</DOC>

It is not possible to quantify in dollar terms the costs to small business of the WorkChoices reforms. The principal object of Work Choices is to simplify Australia's workplace relations system and reduce the compliance costs on small business by reducing the complexity and red tape of the current six separate legislative systems in operation.However, Work Choices does eliminate costs for small business in the form of 'go away money'  -  money paid out by small businesses as a result ex-employees bring forward vexatious unfair dismissal claims. Businesses that employ up to and including 100 employees will be exempt from unfair dismissal laws.An information and education campaign to promote and explain the workplace relations reforms to all Australian employees and employers, including small business, has been launched to coincide with the proclamation of the Work Choices legislation.See the response to Question 1. As to fees, Work Choices will not impose any new fees on small business.No. The introduction of a lodgement only process for individual and collective agreements has simplified agreement making. The Office of the Employment Advocate provides templates and assistance for employers and employees electing to initiate a workplace agreement.As professionals, if a lawyer is employed to draw up an individual contract then they would need to ensure that it is a lawful contract, the same as they do for any type of contract they assist with. It is part of a lawyer's role to keep abreast of applicable changes to the law and changes to workplace law are no different in this respect.The Work Choices legislation amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996; I am advised that it has not amended income tax legislation. Questions on tax deductibility of specific expenses should be directed to the Australian Taxation Office.It is not compulsory for small business to arrange individual contracts with their existing or new employees. Consequently, there are no deadlines to arrange individual contracts for existing employees. Existing agreements in place at the commencement of Work Choices will continue to operate beyond their nominal expiry date until terminated or replaced.The Government is aware of concerns in the small business sector about what the Work Choices reforms mean for them. Education campaigns are an important part of policy implementation as they equip those affected to make the transition successfully. Accordingly, a targeted awareness and education campaign will be delivered. Additional assistance and advice will be available through the Office of Employment Advocate, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, and employer organisations. The latest Sensis® Business Index released on 28 February 2006 reported that industrial relations policy was the main reason SMEs gave for supporting the Federal Government.Representations received by the Department from small businesses and industry associations have not focused on confusion about the Work Choices changes.Yes. Other recent surveys have also explored this aspect of the Work Choices reforms. The February 2006 Sensis Business Index  -  Small &amp; Medium Enterprises found that 'Of those small businesses intending to make changes as a result of the reforms, they are most likely to do this by hiring more staff'.See response to Question 2. Questions on program details should be directed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.</DOC>

Until 30 June 2004, the Commonwealth accepted financial responsibility for the National Highway System. The AusLink arrangements provide for the sharing of costs with the States and Territories of projects on the National Land Transport Network, which incorporates the former National Highway.Under the arrangements for funding the former National Highway System, matters such as the provision of access to service centres, shopping, housing and industrial developments and parking lanes were ineligible for Commonwealth funding and hence may have been funded by either the State or relevant local council. Councils may have chosen to fund or contribute to infrastructure works on the National Highway where there were significant benefits to their local communities. As any such projects did not involve Australian Government funds, the Department of Transport and Regional Services does not have the relevant records.</DOC>

I am advised that such a study was completed in early 2002.The report found that the option that is currently under construction would have a benefit cost ratio of 13.9.The study indicated that the benefits of additional ramps to most highway users are likely to be small and will flow mainly to local residents through traffic reductions on the local and arterial road network. Construction of the ramps would slightly increase the volume of traffic using the southern section of the F5.The construction of the north-facing ramps at Brooks Road in the early 1990s was funded by NSW. Given the high level of benefits flowing to local users, the Australian Government initially took the view that the provision of the complementary south-facing ramps was a matter for the NSW and/or local governments.Subsequently, the former Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP, agreed that the Australian Government would fund up to two-thirds of the cost of the ramps, with the balance to be funded by NSW and/or the local community. The NSW Government declined to fund the project and Campbelltown City Council agreed to pay the remaining third of the cost.</DOC>

None. Universities were permitted to admit domestic undergraduate fee-paying medical students for the first time in 2005. However, there were cases where an international fee-paying medical student part way through their course, and part way through a year, was granted permanent resident status. In these circumstances, guidelines under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 permitted universities to charge these students domestic fees for semester 2 of the specific year only. After that semester, these students were to compete for HECS-liable places. In 2004 there were 2.4 EFTSU reported for such students.Higher education providers are required to submit final data for 2005 through the Higher Education Student Collection by 31 March 2006. It is expected that these data will be verified by late July and released shortly afterwards.It is expected that data for 2006 submitted by higher education providers through the Higher Education Student Collection will be available by mid 2007.Not applicable  -  see answer to (a)(i).No data availableNo data available.The limit on the number of domestic undergraduate fee-paying medical places applies only to Table A providers.

Yes.Yes.Yes.Proposed developments at the federally-leased airports are assessed on a case by case basis. The Airports Act 1996 (the Act) and the associated Regulations are the statutory framework for the regulation of development at Australia's leased federal airport sites. The primary mechanisms for managing development under the Act are Master Plans and Major Development Plans. Master Plans deal with matters relating to the development and operation of an airport including the development objectives of the lessee; the lessee's assessment of the future needs of the airport; and forecast noise level exposure due to the operation of the airport. Major Development Plans deal with the objectives of a specific development to the extent that it meets the needs of users of the airport; whether the development is consistent with the final master plan for the airport; if the development could affect noise levels, the effect on noise exposure levels; the lessee's assessment of the environmental impact of the development; and other matters as specified in the Regulations.No.No, the Australian Government has no intention of conceding any planning control over what are Commonwealth sites. Section 112 of the Act excludes State and Territory planning laws from applying to the federally leased airports. A number of factors underpinned the Australian Government's decision to retain regulatory planning control over the leased airports in the lead up to the first Federal airports being privatised. Primarily these were:the Government's original decision to lease rather than sell the airports, meaning that the airports remain 'Commonwealth places', and revert back to the Government at the end of the lease period;regulation by the Australian Government ensures a consistent national approach is applied at all 22 Federal leased airports;many of the airport structures, for example runways, taxiways and aprons, are regulated under Federal safety legislation and the States and Territories do not have technical expertise in determining these matters; andthe Australian Government's on-going responsibility for related aviation matters such as air safety, aviation security, curfews and protection of airspace around airports in compliance with Australia's international obligations.Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) is already a party to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the NSW Government that establishes a framework for consultation on matters associated with policies and programs that relate to the Airport. SACL and the NSW Government meet on a regular basis to discuss issues including those arising from the Airport's development proposals and the potential impact on the surrounding infrastructure. In addition, the Airports Act provides adequate opportunity for consultation and, together with the arrangements in place through the MoU and its consultations, the NSW and Local Governments and the general public therefore have considerable opportunity to comment on development proposals at Sydney Airport.In addition, the Australian Government has made a commitment through its response to the Inquiry into the Development of the Brisbane Airport Corporation Master Plan to develop, in consultation with major stakeholders and public interest groups, a standard set of guidelines to promote a shared understanding for how consultation processes should be managed. My Department has developed draft guidelines and will be consulting with local councils on their development.See answer to (6).</DOC>

No, Australian citizens may not provide support to Hamas. Hamas is a listed terrorist organisation under Part 4 of the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 ('the Act') and the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2002 ('the Regulations'). The Act implements Australia's international obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and successor resolutions and makes it a criminal offence for any person to provide funds or financial assistance of any kind to Hamas, whether directly or indirectly. The military wing of Hamas has also been listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code 1995 which provides for additional obligations and offences.Under the Act, the Foreign Minister may revoke the listing of Hamas if the Foreign Minister ceases to be satisfied that Hamas is a terrorist organisation as defined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. Likewise, the Attorney-General may revoke the listing of the military wing of Hamas if he ceases to be satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in, fostering or advocating the doing of a terrorist act. The decision to list, or to revoke a listing, is not determined by whether an organisation is elected. Australia supports the calls of the international community for Hamas to renounce violence, recognise Israel and recognise existing agreements between the PLO and Israel.</DOC>

The number of livestock exported to each country during 2005 is listed in Attachment 1. Livestock species are cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer and camelids. The statistics are collated from the information on the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) export permits. In addition 18,445 cats, dogs and horses and 18.69 million other species (e.g. fish, insects, hatching eggs, laboratory animals) were exported to wide variety of countries. Apart from a small number of horses, these animals are all exported by air.Statistics on animal mortalities during transport are compiled for all livestock species. I am required under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to table a report every six months, in both Houses of the Parliament, containing information on livestock voyages by sea and the mortalities for each voyage based on the information submitted by the Master to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). I have attached the last two reports to Parliament (attachment 2 and attachment 3). Please note the livestock numbers in the report to the Parliament differ from the information supplied in Attachment 1. The inconsistency is caused by the timing of the receipt of information. The information in Attachment 1 is based on AQIS data at the time of export but the reports from the Master of the vessel to AMSA are not supplied until some after voyages are completed.For livestock species, exporters must comply with the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (ASEL) which includes specific standards for the management of livestock during preparation and transport to prevent casualties during export journeys. The standards are jointly developed by industry, animal welfare and state and commonwealth agencies. Versions are endorsed by the Primary Industries Ministerial Council. The current version is version 1. The ASEL include requirements for the selection, preparation, transport and on-board management of livestock by sea and by air. The standards cover, amongst other things, minimum feed, water, space requirements, veterinary kits and hospital pen space for the various species during the export journey. For livestock voyages by sea, the standards include a requirement for accredited stockman to accompany the animals and provide reports to AQIS. AQIS also requires accredited veterinarians to accompany all voyages to Middle East destinations to report on the welfare and management of the animals during these voyages.Exporters of other live animals must satisfy AQIS that the animals are fit to undertake the proposed journey and that appropriate travel arrangements for the particular species, number of animals and length of journey have been made. AQIS uses the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Regulations which are published annually as a guide to determine whether an exporter's plans for the export of animals by air are satisfactory.Regulations and inspections relating to the export of live animals by government agencies are:Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Export Licensing) Amendment Regulations 2004 sets out the requirements, processes and conditions for livestock export licences;Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Standards) Order 2005 references the ASEL;Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Live Cattle Exports to Republic of Korea) Order 2002 sets out specific requirements for export of cattle to Korea;Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry (Export of Lives-stock to Saudi Arabia) Order 2005 sets out specific requirements for export of livestock to Saudi Arabia;Export Control (Animals) Order 2004 sets requirements for livestock to be inspected at registered premises prior to export and the capacity for AQIS or AQIS accredited veterinarians to supervise the selection and preparation of animals during the export process. Under these orders, AQIS may require an AQIS or AQIS accredited veterinarian to accompany any shipment of live animals on the export journey and report on the animals' welfare during the voyage;Marine Order 43 administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Agency (AMSA) sets out the physical standards ships must meet to ensure the safe carriage of animals as well as obligations on the master to monitor and report on the health and welfare of the animals during the voyage. The order also references specific mortality levels which trigger investigations by a marine surveyor if exceeded.The two relevant international standards are the World Organisation for Animal Health animal welfare guidelines and the IATA Regulations. Both international standards are taken into account when formulating the ASEL.Attachment 1Species Sent by Market - 2005CountryCattleSheepGoatsBuffaloCamelsAlpacasDeerArgentina1717Bahrain510,778Bangladesh6Brazil27216Brunei6,5731,38793634China27,3491,76944Egypt11,31735,000Indonesia323,69929100Israel42,8977,343Japan23,037Jordan3,924672,071Kazakhstan219Kuwait3,003875,3001210431Malaysia33,60122,20533,9302,302Mexico17,39981New Caledonia4New Zealand1178377Oman250318,196Philippines21,455371,30438124Qatar183163,755Sabah3401,491Saudi Arabia17,6201,066,603Singapore5405,6361South Korea1,702Switzerland83Taiwan339Thailand9341234Timor-Leste19UAE1,210238,441USA11152854Vietnam1,046Total535,7113,912,39845,3293,34734562789</DOC>

Austudy recipients have never been entitled to Rent Assistance. Austudy is the only income support payment that does not attract Rent Assistance. While Austudy recipients cannot get Rent Assistance, the Government has included a generous personal income free area of $236 per fortnight using any credit accumulated to offset high income in other fortnights. This enables full time students on Austudy to continue to be engaged in the workforce and keep most of the money they earn from casual or part time employment. There is also a higher rate of Austudy for long-term income support recipients commencing full-time study or a New Apprenticeship.</DOC>

A post-trial report detailing the findings of the trial is not due before the end of August 2006.The Australian Government approved funding of up to $1.4 million towards the initial 12-month trial based on indicative estimates provided by the Queensland Department of Main Roads. Subject to validation, claims for toll revenue reimbursement have not been received to date and it is not expected that claims for the initial 12-month period will be finalised prior to submission of the post-trial report.Data on the number of trucks that used the Logan Motorway and Gateway Motorway Extension during the initial 12-month toll free period will not be available until the draft post-trial report is received.The Queensland Department of Main Roads has advised that the number of trucks using the Logan Motorway and Gateway Motorway Extension during 2003/2004 for the equivalent time period was 119,067 and 83,394 respectively, for a total of 202,461.The toll free period was extended to ensure that there is adequate time to examine the impact of the initial 12-month trial before any further decisions are taken.The Queensland Department of Main Roads has advised, based on four months data collected to June 2005, that there has been only a slight reduction in the number of trucks and articulated vehicles using the BUC in the toll free period hours. Nonetheless residents' perceptions, as reported in survey results, are that fewer trucks are using the BUC and that noise levels are reduced.</DOC>

Yes. Exporters are required to be licensed where individual shipments of grape products exceed 100 litres and fees are payable for both the initial export licence application and for the annual licence renewal.Yes, exporters of small and large volumes of wine pay the same sum for an export licence. Currently the export licence application fee is $298.10 for levypayers and $1,192.40 for non-levypayers and the annual licence renewal fee is $266.20.For the 2004/05 financial year the revenue raised from export licence fees was $436,555.00.The revenue raised from export licence fees is used to cover the costs associated with the issuing of export licences and maintaining the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation's (AWBC's) export related services.
The initial export licence application fee has not risen since 2000 but the export licence renewal fee was increased in 2004. The justification for increasing the renewal fee was a 2003-04 review that indicated the AWBC was not recovering costs associated with the issue of export licenses and the maintenance of its export related services.

Yes.The partners in the International Experimental Thermonuclear Reactor (ITER) have committed significant funding to the construction and operation of a research facility at Cadarache in France to advance fusion energy research. The original six partners in ITER were the US, the European Union, China, Russia, Japan and Korea. In December 2005 India joined the ITER consortium.I am aware of the important part played by the Australian scientist, Sir Mark Oliphant, in the discovery of fusion energy.Through the International Science Linkages Program the Government is supporting an international workshop organised by the Australian ITER Forum to increase awareness among Australian researchers and business of the potential for participation in ITER. The workshop is planned to take place in September 2006. Each ITER partner will be invited to nominate a representative to attend the workshop.</DOC>

A Centre for International Economics (CIE) study commissioned by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and entitled Economic impacts of an Australia-United States Free Trade Area was released in 2001 and a further study entitled Economic Analysis of AUSFTA was commissioned in 2004. The focus of the studies was not on the bilateral trade balance between Australia and the United States. Rather, they attempted to estimate the overall impact of the Agreement on Australia's output and welfare.Both CIE reports did, however, include modelling which looked at changes in the direction of Australia's exports and imports. In the 2004 report, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model projected Australia's exports to the United States would increase by A$3.3 billion and that imports from the United States would increase by A$6.5 billion in the long run (this part of the modelling did not look at short run effects). The report noted that the results of this part of the study should be regarded with caution due to the difficulties in modelling the complex factors affecting supply and demand.It is important to note that the 2004 report predicted the expected liberalisation of trade and investment under the free trade agreement would result in an increase in Australia's overall welfare (measured as real GNP) of A$52.5 billion over 20 years.Yes. These figures refer to Australia's merchandise trade deficit with the United States and are correct.Yes. These figures refer to Australia's merchandise exports and imports, but exclude services exports and imports. Australian merchandise exports to the United States have been falling since 2001 due in major part to the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar. This trend continued in the first 7 months of the current financial year. However, when volatile export items such as crude oil and passenger motor vehicles are excluded, Australia's merchandise exports to the United States grew by 1.7 per cent during this time, even as the Australian dollar appreciated by a further 1.9 per cent against the US dollar. The fall in exports of crude oil and passenger motor vehicles to the United States was due to market factors unrelated to the FTA. The fall in our crude oil exports to the United States coincided with a surge in our crude oil exports to a number of our trading partners in Asia. Australia's services exports, which comprise around one third of total exports to the United States, rose by 4.1 per cent to A$4.45 billion in 2005.The purpose of the Agreement is to increase Australia's welfare by boosting two-way trade, investment, and domestic competition. Bilateral trade agreements are intended to boost the exports of both countries.The Government is working actively to maximise the Agreement's positive impact on Australian exports. The Government has expanded Austrade's US operations to include 23 new export facilitators, now giving it representation in 18 cities (an increase of 12).Under the FTA, Australian exporters gained access to the $200 billion US Government procurement market. In May 2005, Austrade established a Selling to Government office in the Australian Embassy in Washington. In this financial year, the Selling to Government team has assisted over 20 Australian companies to establish over $90 million worth of contracts.Available evidence suggests that opportunities under the FTA are being taken up by Australian business. The 2005 Sensis Business Index has found that over one quarter of exporting SMEs nominated the United States as a major export destination, a rise of five per cent from the beginning of the year. A combined Austrade and Sensis study indicates that as of February 2006, the United States is now the most popular export destination for Australian small to medium businesses, growing 14 per cent in a year to now be ahead of New Zealand and Britain. In 2005 Austrade directly assisted 46 per cent more clients than in 2004 to achieve export success in the United States, and these clients achieved combined sales totalling 44 per cent more than in 2004. Invest Australia has recorded an increase in inquiries of thirty per cent in 2005 from potential US investors in Australia.The Australia-United States FTA is a long term commitment to strengthening trade relations and economic integration with the world's largest economy. The Agreement delivers benefits - and should be judged - across the breadth of the economic relationship.</DOC>

and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of federal electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one electorate or ESA may elect to be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the electorate of Banks may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the electorate of Barton. The Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAs are most closely aligned with the electorate of Banks and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to these ESAs.At end March 2006 there were 15 employment services providers operating in the Canterbury/Bankstown ESA and 16 in the St George/Sutherland ESA. The names and office locations of all Job Network members and Job Placement Only organisations then operating in these ESAs are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Job Network  -  Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland Employment Services Areas

 Site details and job seeker numbers are as at 31 March 2006. Caseload numbers are for the 'JN Active Caseload', that is job seekers currently in assistance with a JN site or very recently referred for assistance. Caseload numbers are at a point in time and change as job seekers are referred to a site or exit assistance at the site. JPOs are not allocated a specific business share, but compete to secure vacancies from employers and to refer eligible job seekers.The numbers of Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients placed into jobs through assistance from Job Network providers in the year 2005, in (i) Australia and (ii) the Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAs, are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Total Job Placements for Newstart and Youth Allowance RecipientsCalendar YearAustraliaCanterbury/Bankstown ESASt George/Sutherland ESA2005454,2274,7753,599Note: Numbers for 2005 include placements made by ESC3 Job Placement Only Organisations that do not deliver Job Network services.

While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker's needs.The Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) measures job seekers' outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients rather than the full population.Aggregated outcomes estimates for Intensive Support for the Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAs are shown in Table 4. Table 4 includes (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment 3 months after exiting their placements.Table 4: Intensive Support Post Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Canterbury/Bankstown and St George/Sutherland ESAsYear of outcomesTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)Casual Employment1 (%)20052

The Inquiry highlighted conflicting views on whether the Commissioner of Taxation could provide publicly available information to prescribed industry or professional organisations under the secrecy provisions.The Solicitor-General has subsequently advised that public information is not subject to the secrecy provisions. As a general principle, where the Commissioner obtains tax information from a public source he may disclose this information to entities such as the New South Wales Bar Association.However, the Solicitor-General further advised that when disclosing public information, the Commissioner must make it clear to the recipient that the accuracy of the public information has not been confirmed by reference to his own records. The Commissioner's records are subject to the secrecy provisions in the tax law and therefore cannot be disclosed. However, a recent meeting between representatives of the Australian Taxation Office and key legal professional associations has resolved that the practicalities associated with the Commissioner making public information available in this way are such that the required process would prove administratively and practically unworkable.As the current law does not prohibit the Australian Taxation Office from disclosing public information, an amendment to the legislation as described, would not achieve the intended outcome.In view of the limitations associated with the way the Australian Taxation Office can deal with publicly available information, an amendment to the legislation that would achieve the intended outcome may well be significantly more complex than it first appears.</DOC>

Paragraph six of the answer provided states that: 'That said, the ACCC already undertakes extensive informal monitoring of petrol, diesel and auto LPG prices at over 4,000 sites across Australia, as well as the international crude oil, refined petroleum, and wholesale prices. The ACCC publishes much of this information on its website and recently announced that retailer margins will also be published in order to further inform and educate consumers. Informed consumers, both individuals and businesses, can exert downward pressure on prices and increase understanding of the operation of the petrol market. In addition, the ACCC has and will continue to investigate complaints of price fixing, predatory pricing and other anti-competitive conduct in the petroleum industry and take legal action where appropriate.'In light of further advice provided by the ACCC, the reference to 4,000 sites should be corrected to read 3,600 while the word much should be replaced with the word some. The word retailer should be corrected to read refiner.</DOC>

The average price of petrol increased by 1.8 per cent in 2003-04 and by 11.3 per cent in 2004 - 05 (these are the most recent financial years for which complete data is available). The average cents per kilometre rate increased by 1.7 per cent in 2004-05 and by 6.2 per cent in 2005-06 (the cents per kilometre rates apply for a one year period from March).The average price of petrol and the average cost of work related expenses, calculated under the cents per kilometre method have both increased over the last financial years for which complete data is available.The cents per kilometre rates are adjusted annually in line with the Public Service Motor Vehicle Allowance set by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in line with the annual movements in the Private Motoring Subgroup of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The subgroup, among other items, takes into account price movements in automotive fuel.</DOC>

Senior Case Officers bring into their contracts the family law related qualifications, skills and experience necessary to make decisions relating to change of assessment. Prior to commencing case work, they are provided with administrative training to enable them to exercise their skills in the CSA environment. This training includes 3 days of formal training, where they learn about the organisation, the child support formula, change of assessment procedures, privacy matters, holding a conference, as well as detailed information about each of the reasons under which a change of assessment decision may be made (including case studies).Following formal training, there is a mentoring program which, based on identified individual needs, may include buddying with more experienced Senior Case Officers, sitting in on conferences, or other training/guidance as required. In addition, Senior Case Officers have all of their decisions monitored, with changes made and guidance given as required, for a period of time after commencement. This continues until the manager is satisfied that decisions are being made and written up to an appropriate standard, or until a decision is made to terminate the Senior Case Officer's contract.Senior Case Officer contracts require them to independently maintain and improve their skill-levels, and to participate periodically in refresher training and quality assurance in relation to the tasks associated with their decision-making.Senior Case Officers are required to follow Family Law precedents, and to have regard to CSA and government policy when making decisions. Child Support policy is reflected in The Guide which appears on the CSA website [www.csa.gov.au]. CSA also provides procedural instructions that indicate how CSA policies apply to Change of Assessment circumstances.The discretion is only limited by the grounds for departure contained in the legislation and any Family Court decisions determining how those grounds are to be considered.External Senior Case Officers only make decisions in Change of Assessment matters, including any objections to Change of Assessment decisions. CSA also has a small number of internal Senior Case Officers. The statistics do not record the breakdown between external and internal Senior Case Officers. By 'granted' I assume you mean that the assessment was changed. I provide information of the number of applications finalised rather than 'made' for the financial years ended 30 June 1999/2000  -  2004/2005 in the table below.

An Age Pension customer who undertakes exam supervision twice a year has the option of having these earnings assessed either in the period the income is earned, or by having the earnings held as income across the whole year.The option chosen will produce different outcomes on the customer's rate of Age Pension. The amount of reduction in the customer's pension also depends on the amount of income already assessed from other sources such as investments.Centrelink staff are expected to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different income assessments with an Age Pension customer when the customer advises they have commenced employment.Customers are encouraged to decide which is the best method of assessment for them, so that they are not disadvantaged. At the same time they must satisfy the Customer Service Officer, as the delegate, that the method chosen is the best reflection of the customer's current income on a per annum basis.When income from exam supervision is assessed in the period in which it is earned, it may result in a reduction in a pensioner or pensioner couple's pension payment, but only for the time that the income is earned and not for a whole year.This can be to a customer's advantage when income is high for a short period of time. Many customers prefer to reduce their pension payment for one or two fortnights while they are earning additional money than receive a reduced pension for the whole year when they have no other source of income.When the total income earned from exam supervision is assessed over the whole year, the pension may be reduced to a lesser extent or not at all. However, any reduction in pension will apply to the whole year. This option can be preferable where a customer wishes to receive their pension without any break in payments.To prepare this answer, it has taken approximately 11 hours and 21 minutes at an estimated cost of $511.</DOC>

Under the Social Security Act 1991 the Age Pension is an annual amount based on current income. Therefore most income is assessed on an annual basis for Age Pension customers. An Age Pensioner's employment income is recorded into the Centrelink computer system by the Customer Service Officer, who determines the frequency of assessment with the customer. Once input into the system the ongoing assessment is automatic from that point forward.Where income from employment is above the allowable limits, an Age Pensioner's payments will be reduced. Safeguards in place to ensure customers who can have their income assessed annually are not penalised for excess fortnightly income include detailed policy and procedural information for staff to answer customer enquiries, either in person or via the telephone. These procedures include specific information regarding the options available for customers with short term earnings from employment, including having the earnings assessed either across the whole year, or only in the period the income is earned. Centrelink staff are expected to discuss these options and their effect on the customer's rate of Age Pension and the advantages and disadvantages of the different income assessment processes with an Age Pension customer when the customer advises they have commenced employment.Customers are encouraged to decide which is the best method of assessment for them, so that they are not disadvantaged. At the same time they must satisfy the Customer Service Officer, as the delegate, that the method chosen is the best reflection of the customer's current income on a per annum basis.From September 2005 Age Pension customers who have income from employment that reduces their pension to nil, have their payments suspended rather than immediately cancelled for the first 13 weeks of their employment. Where the work lasts for less than 13 weeks the customer does not have to go through the process of reclaiming pension but has their payment reinstated immediately once the income ceases or reduces sufficiently to allow them to receive payments again.This information is not available because the management information collected regarding overpayments cannot determine whether employment income is assessed on an annual or other basis.Customers who visit a Centrelink Customer Service Centre or call a Centrelink Call Centre will have any enquiries relating to the assessment of employment income answered in terms of the procedures discussed in question (2) above.

The Honourable Member for Wills is correct. I did make that statement in my Address to the Nation on 20 March 2003.The legal advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, tabled in Parliament by me on 18 March 2003, made clear that the use of force in Iraq was lawful. The legal authority for the use of force derives from successive UN resolutions stemming from UN Security Council Resolution 678. The presence or absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq was not a pre-condition for the use of force, rather it was the continued violation of UN Security Council resolutions which justified military action.</DOC>

Yes. The ATO did engage Colmar Brunton Social Research to conduct the tracking the individual segment survey at a cost of $180,000.The purpose of the survey is to ascertain perceptions individuals have towards the administration of the tax system and obtain their views on the products and services provided by the ATO as well as identifying any potential compliance risks.Collecting this data will provide the ATO with early identification of changes in community confidence and emerging risks and enables the ATO to profile the different sub-segments within the individuals segment.In this particular case, services were acquired from an outside contractor because the ATO had a need for specialised skills.</DOC>

US nationals (including backpackers) can enter Australia on a variety of visas. For example, eligible US nationals can enter on Tourist visas for holiday purposes and Special Program visas with work rights similar to those available under the Working Holiday programme. It is possible for people on visitor visas to apply onshore for visas with work rights, for example, the Long Stay Business visa (subclass 457).No. As indicated in the previous answer, there is no barrier to eligible US nationals entering Australia.Discussions with the Government of the USA concerning a reciprocal working holiday arrangement are continuing through diplomatic channels. The aim of the arrangement is not to 'facilitate entry to Australia by US backpackers', but is designed to enhance the holiday and work experience for both young US nationals coming to Australia, and, just as importantly, for young Australians wishing to work and holiday in the US.</DOC>

This is to ensure that the opportunity to present or cash the original cheque is minimised. Where the cheque has not been presented, the ATO is able to immediately issue a replacement cheque. Where the cheque has been presented, investigation is undertaken as to the circumstances of presentation to ensure there is no fraudulent activity before a replacement cheque can be issued.There is no obligation under the Taxation Acts for persons receiving a misaddressed refund cheque to return it to the ATO.The ATO is unable to ascertain how many taxpayers did not receive their tax refund in 2004-2005 because their cheques were misaddressed and were not returned to the ATO.</DOC>

The new office is located one floor above the Centrelink CSC site. The Melton lease expired on 19 February 2006 and the remaining lease commitment was factored into the business case for relocation. The Melton premises have, however, been listed with local real estate agents for sub-lease or assignment to mitigate this.CentrelinkCentrelink occupies all of the properties in its commercial leased portfolio with one exception, being 70 Main Street Meekatharra, Western Australia. Centrelink also owns 26 residences required in remote areas to lease to key Centrelink staff working in these locations. At present, four of these houses are vacant and the details are provided in the table below.The commercial leased property at Meekatharra was leased by Centrelink in June 2005 with the intention of establishing a new Remote Access Service Centre in Meekatharra. The commercial arrangement required Centrelink to pay a token rental of $867 per month and be responsible for funding significant building improvements required to bring the property up to Australian Standards, which are normally a cost to the landlord in a standard lease transaction. Unfortunately, the tendered price for the required works of almost $1 million was prohibitive and significantly inflated due to the remoteness of the location, and the difficulty in getting suitably qualified tradesmen to undertake the work. At present, the Meekatharra property remains vacant while Centrelink reassesses its property and servicing options in the town.

The Olympic Park venue was used from 25-27 October 2005 for a two and a half day conference for the national natural resource management (NRM) facilitators network. This was an important forum for facilitators updating knowledge, exchanging of professional experience and strengthening linkages to regional body representatives, non-government organisations and government officials.There are 56 regions established under the Natural Heritage Trust to deliver the Australian Government's environment, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture objectives. The facilitators play a vital role in ensuring we achieve quality outcomes and enhanced coordination that is vital to achieving the best value for money.

This is in addition to approximately $90,000 in legal fees that Treasury incurred for the special leave application.No. Mr McKinnon has sought costs in the matter which the department will be required to pay if awarded by the High Court.No. Applicants can seek costs which the department will be required to pay if awarded by the Court under current law.Decisions on the issue of conclusive certificates are not based on guidelines, but are taken consistently with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, as well as relevant decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court of Australia.No.</DOC>

I am aware of reports that SBS was planning to broadcast an episode of the US animated series South Park entitled Bloody Mary. The episode was due to be screened on 6 March 2006 but was withdrawn. I am not aware of any plans to broadcast this episode as this is a matter for SBS.Yes.The Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) does not classify material  -  that is the responsibility of the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. The classification of television content falls outside the scope of the National Classification Scheme. As at 20 April 2006 the episode has not been submitted on DVD as a sale/hire application for classification by the Classification Board.As mentioned above, the Boards do not classify television content. It is, therefore, not within my jurisdiction to prevent the broadcast of this program. The honourable member may wish to raise his concerns with SBS directly. Complainants who are not satisfied with the response provided by SBS may refer the matter to ACMA for review.</DOC>

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is stepping up its compliance measures around the payment of Child Care Benefit. Particularly high or low amounts of Child Care Benefit paid to customers may be subject to current or future compliance investigations and it would not be appropriate to report on those at this time.The average amount of Child Care Benefit paid per customer, as fee reduction, for the indicated years may be found in the published Annual Reports of the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (formerly the Department of Family and Community Services).The reconciliation process for child care used in the 2004-05 financial year was only commenced since July 2005. Not enough customers have been reconciled to provide meaningful information on the numbers of top-ups payments and over-payments for the 2004-05 financial year.The Howard Government has provided unprecedented support to parents for child care. Families now get more help with their child care costs than ever before. Please refer to the response in paragraph 1.This data is being provided this time, however data in this form will not be provided in the future due to the time required for collation.The number of children under school-age in each State and Territory and using approved child care (as measured by CCB paid for at least one session per week, for any week in a financial year) for 2003-2004 and 2004-2005, and as a percentage of all children in the same age bracket, is as follows:State / Territory2003-042004-05Number of children% of populationNumber of children% of populationNSW178,80042%183,30043%VIC115,00038%115,80038%QLD140,50056%144,20058%SA35,10039%35,80040%WA49,10039%51,00041%TAS13,40044%14,10047%NT5,00029%5,10029%ACT9,30045%9,20045%Note:1.

One in five Australians meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder of a mild, moderate or severe nature. Of these, approximately 75 per cent will seek assistance from a GP, with some people seeking additional assistance from other mental health providers.The Better Outcomes in Mental Health Initiative was established to improve access to quality primary mental health care by increasing GP skills and knowledge in mental health and by providing GPs with support for their patients from allied health professionals and psychiatrists.On 5 April 2006, the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Government will contribute $1.8 billion in new funds to reform the mental health system, with a commitment of around $500 million in the fifth year and ongoing, for the five-year action plan that is being developed.</DOC>

I am aware that the Hon Pat Farmer MP has made a call for interest free home loans for the purchase of public housing by tenants.Neither the Department, my staff nor I have been requested to calculate the cost of providing interest free loans to public housing tenants.I am not aware of plans to introduce a policy to encourage public housing tenants to purchase their homes with interest free loans. I am, however, aware of a number of Government subsidised tenant home purchase schemes operating around Australia, although these schemes are not interest free. Examples are the HomeStart EquityStart loan in South Australia, the GoodStart scheme in Western Australia and the Streets Ahead Program in Tasmania.The Government has not undertaken an examination of any policies relating to the interest-free purchase of properties by tenants.The Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI) coordinates research on a wide range of issues including access to home ownership. Further information is available on the AHURI website, www.ahuri.edu.au.</DOC>

Yes.A discussion paper on media reform options, Meeting The Digital Challenge  -  Reforming Australia's Media In The Digital Age was released on 14 March 2006. The discussion paper addresses a range of matters including potential reforms to the regulation of media ownership.In the discussion paper, the Government proposes to retain important constraints on ownership concentration of the currently-regulated platforms (commercial TV and radio) and newspapers to ensure a continuing diversity of commercial sources of information and entertainment, while also enabling greater freedom for both existing and new media groups to engage in legitimate diversification strategies on traditional and new platforms. In addition to the regulated platforms and potential new services, consumers would continue to have access to two national broadcasters, community television and radio broadcasters, subscription TV, the internet and 'out of area' newspapers (such as national newspapers).The Government will consider responses to the discussion paper in developing its plans for reform across the range of media issues discussed in the paper.</DOC>

ITSA
In the course of administering bankrupt estates and realising assets that have vested in the Official Trustee, the ITSA, acting on behalf of the Official Trustee, has sold Telstra shares which vested in the trustee during the period 15 October 1997 to 7 September 2005. The Official Trustees does not 'trade' in Telstra shares, it only sells shares in accordance with its statutory duty to realise property as expeditiously as possible and does not speculate.During this period the Official Trustee has also sold Telstra shares as a controlling trustee under Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime legislation.Detailed records of these sale transactions are not readily recoverable. All such chares were acquired pursuant to the vesting provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 or pursuant to Proceeds of Crime court orders. No shrews were acquired through purchase.

As at 21 March 2006 the Commonwealth has paid compensation in 11 matters in response to claims for unlawful detention since 1995. In 4 of those matters, a Court found that the Commonwealth was liable and awarded damages to the individual. In the remaining 7 matters, the Commonwealth resolved the matters by way of out of court settlement on the basis of legal advice that it was appropriate to do so consistent with the Attorney-General's Legal Services Directions.Further to these, the Government is aware that Ms Alvarez and Mr T were wrongfully detained.Approximately 20 months.The Commonwealth has paid out $816,075 in response to claims for unlawful detention since 1995.Pursuant to the Legal Services Directions issued by the Attorney-General the Commonwealth must behave as a model litigant and deal with claims promptly, endeavour to avoid litigation wherever possible and pay legitimate claims in accordance with legal principle and practice. In accordance with these obligations the Commonwealth has compensated affected individuals upon receipt of legal advice of a legitimate claim.Additionally, a 'Reconnecting People Assistance Package' (RPAP) was made available on 12 December 2005. It provides for ex gratia assistance to Australian citizens and permanent residents who may have been 'adversely affected by inappropriate detention'.Of the 220 cases bearing the descriptor 'released not unlawful', the department has identified 26 cases involving Australian citizens. Access to the RPAP may be an option for these people.Any individual can bring a legal proceeding seeking court orders for their release from immigration detention and an award of damages arising out of an alleged period of unlawful detention.</DOC>

Everybody on a Bridging Visa E (BVE) who applies for a protection visa within 45 days of entering Australia (in the 12 months preceding their application), who can demonstrate a 'compelling need to work', is provided with work rights. Those who apply for a protection visa, more than 45 days after entering Australia, do not obtain work rights, but may be eligible to apply for Asylum Seeker Assistance.The 45 day rule was introduced to discourage persons who had no legitimate claims to asylum from applying for a protection visa in order to obtain work rights and delay their departure from Australia.
Where a non-citizen is granted a BVE and is making acceptable departure arrangements, or is the subject of acceptable departure arrangements, the no work condition is mandatory on the initial grant. The grant of permission to work is then discretionary for subsequent grants. This discretion will be exercised where the person can demonstrate a 'compelling need to work'.

Where a non-citizen is granted a BVE on merits review grounds, the grant of permission to work is discretionary, and looks to the person to demonstrate a 'compelling need to work'.Non-citizens granted a BVE on judicial review grounds cannot be granted permission to work.It is the usual policy to make the initial grant of a BVE, for applicants at any stage of review, without permission to work. Most applicants may then apply for permission to work.A notable exception to this is where a BVE has been granted, by operation of law, because there was no decision on the visa application within the prescribed period. These BVEs must be subject to the no work condition. There is no discretion for a re-grant with permission to work upon a subsequent application for a BVE.Where the legislation requires that an applicant can demonstrate financial hardship, and that applicant is a parent, it is policy that all family members included in the combined BV application (including minors) are eligible for full permission to work.

No.No.The Australian Government believes that while international experience is useful in considering appropriate responses to security challenges in Australia, our laws reflect our unique system and particular challenges and priorities.  Australia's laws are made by the Australian parliament and subject to a parliamentary review process second to none.  In addition the measures in the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 were agreed by state and territory leaders through the Council of Australian Governments.  In any case, while not directly relevant to Australia's laws, I am advised that the principles identified in the UK report are as follows:legislation against terrorism should approximate as closely as possible to the ordinary criminal law and procedure;additional statutory offences and powers may be justified, but only if they are necessary to meet the anticipated threat.  They must then strike the right balance between the needs of security and the rights and liberties of the individual;the need for additional safeguards should be considered alongside any additional powers; andthe law should comply with the UK's obligations in international law.There has not been a failure in Australia's current anti - terrorism laws.  Based on advice from security and law enforcement agencies, all Australian governments agreed that there was justification for further strengthening current laws.  Governments cannot afford to be complacent.  Terrorists have demonstrated that they are innovative and determined and we have to make sure our laws stay one step ahead of them.By strengthening Australia's counter - terrorism framework, these new anti - terrorism laws place law enforcement and security agencies in a better position to provide greater protection to the Australian community.Yes.The Government is conscious that in formulating our response to terrorism balance is struck between the liberty of the individual and the right of the community to be protected.  We are confident Australia's counter - terrorism laws strike that balance.The new anti - terrorism laws apply to all Australians, irrespective of their race, religion, sex, or other group membership.  The legislation and the powers it confers operate according to strict and objective criteria that are clearly linked to the threat of terrorism.  The safeguards in the legislation are designed to ensure that the new powers are not used arbitrarily.There is no single measure to combat terrorism.  However, the provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 and the Anti - Terrorism Act (No.2) 2005 provide a robust range of measures to enable us to better deter, prevent, detect and prosecute acts of terrorism.The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have the opportunity to be equal participants in Australian society, free to live their lives and maintain their cultural traditions.The government's multicultural policies operate to ensure an environment where freedom of religion is observed and community harmony is maintained.  These policies encourage respect for each person so that, subject to the law, all Australians are able to express their own culture and beliefs and have a reciprocal obligation to respect the rights of others to do the same.  In particular, the government is continuing its efforts to promote respect and understanding through working with state and territory governments to develop a National Action Plan building on the Principles agreed at my meeting with Islamic Community Leaders in August 2005. </DOC>

The CSS and the PSS both provide that a spouse's pension is paid at the full pensioner's rate for the 7 paydays (6 fortnights) following the death of a pensioner.Following the period of 6 fortnights mentioned in the answer to question (1) above, the rate of a spouse's pension in the CSS and the PSS is calculated, in the majority of cases, as follows: 67 per cent of the full pensioner's rate of pension where the deceased pensioner has no eligible children; 78 per cent where there is 1 eligible child; 89 per cent where there are 2 eligible children; and 100 per cent where there are 3 or more eligible children. Also, a pro-rated spouse's pension is available where a pensioner's marital relationship commences after retirement and after age 60, and existed for less than 3 years prior to the date of death. There are other limited circumstances that can also affect the rate of pension paid to a surviving spouse, including where a deceased pensioner has had more than one spouse, where there are partially dependent children, and trustee discretion where there are multiple beneficiaries.A pensioner who retired before 1 July 1976 receives a pension under the Superannuation Act 1922 (1922 Act). The surviving spouse of a 1922 Act pensioner is not entitled to be paid at the full pensioner's rate for 6 fortnights as is the case for the CSS and the PSS. The spouse's pension is immediately payable at the reversionary benefit rates, which in most cases are the rates mentioned in the answer to question (2) above. The Government has no plans to alter the 1922 Act scheme to provide an entitlement to 6 fortnights at the full pensioner's rate. This entitlement was introduced into the CSS and the PSS on the basis of offsetting savings, from restricted access to invalidity benefits, that are not possible under 1922 Act scheme.A current estimate of this cost is not available.</DOC>

The Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) spent $3,459,571 (GST exclusive) on outsourced legal expenditure during the 2004-2005 financial year. As Finance does not directly engage members of the Bar, Barrister's costs are a disbursement associated with the cost of engaging solicitors. Accordingly, Finance records do not distinguish between 'barristers' and 'solicitors' outsourced spending. Obtaining this information would involve manually going through each invoice received, which would be an unreasonable diversion of resources.The total amount spent on internal legal services in the 2004-2005 financial year was $1,630,317 (GST exclusive).Projected forecasted expenditure on legal services for the 2005-2006 financial year is as follows:Internal  -  $2,003,824 (GST exclusive)External  -  $1,585,417 (GST exclusive)</DOC>

I note that the Council of Australian Governments' (COAG) review of National Competition Policy (NCP) drew on the findings and recommendations of the Productivity Commission inquiry report on the Review of National Competition Policy Reforms. The Productivity Commission report found that the implementation of NCP has brought substantial benefits to the Australian community, including regional Australia, which overall have greatly outweighed the costs. It indicated that observed productivity and price changes in key infrastructure sectors in the 1990s  - to which NCP and related reforms have directly contributed  - have permanently increased Australia's GDP by 2.5 per cent, or $20 billion. The competition stream of the National Reform Agenda will build on the success of the past decade of NCP reforms.The communiqué from the 10 February 2006 COAG meeting highlights the inter-governmental nature of the new National Reform Agenda and outlines a number of areas in which the Productivity Commission will conduct reviews to continue to inform the future agenda.The Productivity Commission is modelling the economic impacts of reforms under the National Reform Agenda and is expected to report to COAG by the end of this year.</DOC>

Using OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Secretariat sources, expenditure on foreign aid is reported as a proportion of Gross National Income (GNI). The proportion of GNI spent on foreign aid for the respective countries in 2005 is as follows:the United Kingdom: 0.48France: 0.47Spain: 0.29Ireland: 0.41Australia: 0.25and (3) Public announcements about increases in aid expenditure are often expressed in terms of proportions, rather than as actual amounts, as it can be difficult to accurately predict actual volumes which will also depend on future actual GNI growth.At the UN Summit on 13 September 2005, the Prime Minister announced Australia's intention to double its official aid expenditure to about $A4 billion a year by 2010. Australia has not announced any intentions beyond 2010 with respect to the aid budget.The United Kingdom has announced a timetable to reach an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2013. France, Spain and Ireland are aiming for an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7 per cent by 2012.</DOC>

The Australian Government is not intending to ban live animal exports.
Australia, like all members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE), is working to ensure animals are treated humanely and is determined to do its part to eliminate cruelty to animals. The Australian government and livestock export industry take animal welfare issues very seriously and have been working with countries in the Middle East to support efforts to improve animal handling and facilities, from offloading at the port until the point of slaughter.
The Australian Government has already signed (with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Eritrea, Jordan and the UAE), or is currently negotiating (with Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel and Iran) Memoranda of Understanding on the Trade in Live Animals which outline the conditions under which the trade in live animals can be undertaken in a way that protects the health and welfare of the animals.
An Australian government-industry delegation visited Egypt, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait to discuss animal welfare aspects of the live animal trade in early March 2006. Agriculture Ministers in these countries were receptive to the concerns and agreed to work in partnership with Australia on animal handling, particularly in relation to the unloading and transporting of live animals. Australia's Agriculture Consul in the Middle East is also actively engaging key trading partners on animal handling issues.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the article and the campaigns of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch upon which it was based.The Australian Government has continued to make representations to the Syrian Government though our embassy in Cairo (accredited to Syria) on human rights cases.The United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission (IIIC) into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri is currently preparing to release a report which will list the names of individuals suspected of involvement in the planning, sponsoring, organising or perpetrating the assassination of Mr Hariri. This report will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for consideration.The Australian Government, along with the rest of the international community, has an expectation that Syria will meet its obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1644, which 'demands that Syria responds unambiguously and immediately in those areas adduced by the Commissioner of the IIIC and also that it implements without delay any future request of the Commission'. Australia has also provided an officer on secondment from the Australian Crime Commission to assist in the IIIC investigation.The Syrian Embassy in Canberra has an establishment of five accredited diplomats: the Ambassador, a Second Secretary, a Third Secretary and two Attaches. Their duties relate to bilateral relations and consular services for Syrian nationals in Australia.Since the conclusion of the Iraq War in 2003, I have made numerous statements on Syria's role in the Middle East.

I have seen media reports about a prison camp at Sujiatun, and the allegations of organ harvesting.Chinese Vice-Minister of Health, Huang Jiefu, acknowledged in December 2005 to Caijing magazine, that the sale of executed prisoners' organs was widespread in China, and promised to tighten the rules associated with organ transplants. I understand China's Ministry of Health announced a new regulation on 28 March 2006 which bans organ trading from 1 July, and strengthens oversight of transplants. While the new regulation lacks the authority of a full law, the World Health Organisation has called it a positive step.The issue of organ harvesting has not been raised at the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, but Australia consistently raises its concerns about the use of the death penalty, and about prisoners' rights. The Government is considering what specific issues to raise at the next round of the Dialogue.I have not taken any other steps at this stage, but the Government regularly reviews the issues it raises with the Chinese authorities.Yes. Existing State and Territory legislation prohibits trade in human organs. There will be no change to this policy under a Free Trade Agreement with China.</DOC>

The Treasury administers one programme, the HIH Claims Support Scheme, that community organisations, businesses and individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle can apply for funding from. In order to qualify for support from the scheme individuals and not-for-profit organisations must have held an HIH policy at the time of the collapse of the company and have suffered an insurable loss or have been receiving salary continuance or other payments from HIH at that time. Eligibility for assistance is also means tested for some types of claim. Small businesses in Australia may also qualify for claims assistance in some circumstances. The scheme closed to new applicants in February 2004. However late claims may be made in limited circumstances.Advertising was undertaken when the scheme first opened and prior to its closure to alert policy holders. This advertising was in metropolitan, regional and some ethnic press and on radio. The advertising was paid for as part of the cost of administering the programme.The purpose of the programme was to minimise hardship for Australian HIH policy              holders unable to make a claim against the company due to its collapse.Approval of a claim is made by an independent assessor against the scheme criteria and the insurance policy of the applicant.The claims made against the scheme by organisations and individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle cannot readily be determined.The claims made against the scheme by organisations and individuals in the electoral division of Newcastle cannot readily be determined.</DOC>

Yes.The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 contains a provision that allows the Governor General to make regulations to specify matters that are prohibited from being included in workplace agreements. As I have conveyed to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, these regulations are subject to the usual tabling and disallowance regime under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and to the scrutiny of the Regulations and Ordinance of Bills Committee.The majority of the matters that are prohibited from being included in workplace agreements are matters that could not be contained in pre reform agreements, for example matters that discriminate against employees on grounds of race, sex, disability etc, matters that do not pertain to the employment relationship or which offend the freedom of association provisions. In addition, some new matters have been prohibited. These are matters which are inconsistent with the Government's stated policy for some time, for example, terms that restrict parties from making Australian Workplace Agreements.Yes.The Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Act 2005 (the Act) does not enable an employer to end an agreement on the grounds that negotiations over a new agreement have extended over three months.The best possible guarantee the Australian Government can give is that if we make further sensible change we have the best prospect of being able to ensure that jobs grow in Australia and wages continue to rise. A flexible workplace relations system is one of the ways in which we can further improve productivity and living standards in Australia.</DOC>

Naval Communication Station Harold E Holt does not have an approved 'Guywire Replacement Program'. Guywires are replaced on an ad hoc basis as required under the general maintenance concept and as funding becomes available.By the end of 2006 seven guywires will have been replaced at an approximate cost of $2.052m (including $470,000 for ancillary equipment and site works). Over the next two years, 13 additional guywires will be replaced at an approximate cost of $3.279m. All costs are exclusive of GST.The contractors involved, and work being undertaken, are:Wire Rope Industries - Canada makes the guywires. It was the only company (of those that responded to the internationally-advertised open tender in 2005) that was capable of manufacturing the size of guywire required at the Station.Boeing Australia Limited is responsible for the maintenance, operation and support of the Base. Boeing orders the wires, ensures sizes, lengths, etc are correct, organises delivery to the Station and provides quality assurance.Le Blanc Pty Ltd is subcontracted by Boeing to install the guywires.</DOC>

Australia exports uranium to the United States. These exports are subject to the Agreement between Australia and the United States of America concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy which entered into force on 16 January 1981. Article 8 of the Agreement proscribes the use of Australian uranium for 'any nuclear explosive device, for research on or development of any nuclear explosive device or for any military purpose'. Australian uranium exported to the United States is also subject to the United States' safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.The United States announced in 1991 that it had ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.Australian uranium is exported in accordance with the provisions of Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements. These agreements include a prohibition on any retransfer to another country without Australia's prior consent. The conditions of Australia's safeguards agreements are described in the Annual Reports of the Director General, Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office  -  for example, at pages 23-5 of the 2004-05 report. A list of Australia's safeguards agreements is at page 82 of that report. A copy of the report may be found at http://www.asno.dfat.gov.au/annual_report.</DOC>

Yes.Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is currently investigating Australians' dietary intake of TFAs to determine whether such intakes constitute a public health risk that should be managed, for example, by limits on TFA content in foods, mandatory labelling, or public health messages.FSANZ has recently collaborated with the NSW Food Authority to obtain new analytical data on the levels of TFA in Australian food. FSANZ will use this and other information to estimate current levels of dietary intake, which will assist in determining the public health risk.Australian TFA intakes were last estimated in the 1990s. When compared with other countries at that time, Australian consumption was lower.Currently, TFA content must be declared when claims in relation to the cholesterol content or types of fat such as 'polyunsaturated' in a food are made. Australian manufacturers may also voluntarily declare the TFA content of their products. Many table-spread manufacturers have chosen to do this after finding ways to virtually eliminate TFAs from their products.The Australian Government maintains contact with authorities in the US and Canada to follow the public health, industry and consumer impacts of introduction of mandatory labelling of TFA. This information will be considered when responding to the assessment of public health risks from current intakes of TFA. Australia's TFA intake has been estimated to be lower than US and Canada.</DOC>

Yes. As part of its risk management approach, the ATO has established processes to risk assess certain categories of GST refunds.The ATO continues to balance the need to verify activity statement refunds prior to issue, with the need to meet community and Government expectations that appropriate refunds are issued to the right person in a timely manner. Strategies have been developed (and are continuously reviewed) to address this balance.Activity statement refunds not issued within 14 days (against a benchmark of 92% issued) were:2003-04 5.6%2004-05 7.9%2005-06 (at 3/3/06) 7.18%As part of its risk management strategy, the ATO risk assesses certain categories of taxpayers based on their tax history. Where this history includes regular refund claims that are in line with the client's historic refund pattern, the ATO will not hold up a current refund for verification purposes.Yes. The ATO notifies large enterprise taxpayers by email where their activity statement refund is delayed for verification, this email includes the name and contact details of the taxpayer's key client manager.For all other taxpayers, the ATO notifies them by telephone that their activity statement refund will be subject to verification; the benchmark for this contact is within 48 hours of the intervention.The ATO activity statement processes are aimed at minimising the potential of adverse cash flow or funding impacts.The ATO issued a press release on 15 December 2005 and has started to correct the accounts of those affected. Explanatory correspondence will be sent to taxpayers along with any appropriate amended assessments as accounts are corrected.Based on its work to date, the ATO estimates the revenue impact as being between $150  -  180 million.The ATO is in the process of correcting accounts of affected taxpayers and expects to complete the process by 30 September 2006. All affected taxpayers will be entitled to a credit for the amount of overcharged interest. For taxpayers who have paid the incorrectly charged interest, compensation will also be paid at prevailing base interest rates for the affected periods.The ATO is not aware of any taxpayer who has been made insolvent solely due to the over charged interest.The ATO is subject of external scrutiny through the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) program of audits. The ATO has involved the ANAO in its strategy and processes for rectifying the error.Other than the case which highlighted the error, the ATO is unaware of any cases of disputed liability to penalty interest being pursued in the courts.Corrections have been made to ATO computer systems; any cases amended from 24 September 2005 have had the interest correctly calculated.</DOC>

Insulin glargine (Lantus®) could not be considered for listing on the PBS until PBAC made a recommendation that it be listed. This occurred on 21 April 2006 at an out of session meeting of PBAC. LANTUS® has been recommended by PBAC as both clinically effective and cost effective compared with other available treatments.There are other processes that need to be completed, such as pricing negotiations, before listing can be implemented. These are being progressed now.At an extraordinary meeting in late March, PBAC recommended the listing of LANTUS® as an unrestricted benefit on the PBS. PBAC acknowledged the clinical need for an insulin product that reduces hypoglycaemic events without compromising long-term diabetic control. The cost effectiveness of LANTUS® was accepted at the new price proposed.Studies on the efficacy of drugs are taken into consideration by PBAC.As above.There is no conflict.LANTUS® has been evaluated using the same criteria as all drugs evaluated by PBAC. Although other processes required for listing will be progressed as quickly as possible, it is not possible at present to say when they might be completed.</DOC>

Yes.I met with Mr Kim Ellis, CEO of Bankstown Airport Limited and Camden Airport Limited, on 4 April 2006 and one of the issues discussed was rental increases.Rent reviews are a commercial matter between the Airport Lessee Company (ALC) and their tenants and are conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions set in the lease. It is appropriate that tenants negotiate directly with the ALC to agree on fair and reasonable rental rates having regard to the market reviews that have been conducted in accordance with each lease.I am advised that many of the lease agreements contain provisions that allow for the rent increase to apply from the date that the review is carried out. The negotiation of lease agreements is a commercial matter between the ALC and their tenants.I am advised that if a proposed increase is disputed, most leases contain additional rent review clauses that provide for the appointment of an independent third party valuer to reassess the market rental rate. Given its responsibility for investigating pricing complaints under the Trade Practices Act 1974, any complaints about the level of charges would be a matter for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). Those tenants who remain concerned about rents and other pricing matters at the Airport may therefore wish to raise this matter with the ACCC directly.Camden Airport Limited has advised that their vision is for Camden Airport to be the premier sport and recreation airport in Australia. The Camden Airport sale agreement provides that Camden Airport will have due regard to the existing sport and recreation aviation facilities and operations in developing the master plan. The final master plan for Camden Airport indicates a commitment by the airport to continue to develop the airport and includes provisions for additional hangars, the construction of additional engine-run-up bays and an extended taxiway network.</DOC>

Yes. SIFROL® (pramipexole hydrochloride) was registered in Australia on 20 April 1999. It is approved for use in the treatment of signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.As SIFROL® is registered in Australia, the sponsor of SIFROL®, Boehringer Ingelheim, is legally allowed to market the product in Australia if it chooses to do so.The company manufacturing SIFROL® has chosen not to market the drug in Australia. It is the manufacturer's prerogative as to whether to market a product in Australia and the government cannot compel a manufacturer to market a product. Similarly, the decision to apply for PBS listing of a drug is one that only the manufacturer of the medicine can make. To date, the manufacturer has not applied for the subsidisation of SIFROL® through the PBS. Decisions regarding these matters include commercial and other considerations which can only be made by the company involved.</DOC>

Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) is responsible for works at Sydney Airport to prepare it for the introduction of the Airbus A380. SACL has advised that the A380 airfield works include the provision and strengthening of runway shoulders for runways 16L/34R and runway 07/25, the construction of additional taxiway fillets and the realignment of taxiway Golf at the eastern end of runway 07/25. Additionally, to facilitate aircraft parking six A380 parking positions are being constructed with an additional two positions in future as A380 movements increase.SACL has advised that all work is dependent upon settled weather conditions however the project plan has considered the prevalence of poor weather at the planning stage:The date for the practical completion of the straightening of taxiway Golf which is the last major airfield works is 1 August 2006.Weather conditions have not delayed this work.Airservices Australia has advised that the work has not affected the nomination of the operating modes that use the east west runway. A small number of aircraft have not been able to depart from the east west runway, reportedly because they did not have the aircraft performance data required for departure from an intermediate taxiway.SACL has advised that the A380 works have been planned taking into consideration the maintenance of LTOP and, apart from the notification of a 10 day period in early April, has not impacted on the utilisation of runway 07/25. During this 10 day period the use of the east west runway was limited to arrivals on runway 25 (from the east) and departures on runway 07 (to the east). For 2 days during this period, as a result of weather conditions (wind) the east west runway was fully reinstated and operated exclusively. Additionally, it will be necessary to impose a minor restriction at the eastern end of taxiway Golf for varying periods until the completion of works at the end of July.SACL has advised that the A380 aircraft will be able to operate on the east west runway.Airservices Australia has advised that the work has had no impact on Airservices' ability to nominate an LTOP mode. There has been a very minor impact on Airservices Australia's capacity to achieve its LTOP aircraft movement targets (see answer to 3).</DOC>

and (3) Any student in Victoria who was below the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003, or who was exempt from the year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003, was eligible for the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. The Australian Government does not have the data for eligible students at the electorate level. For postcodes in Melbourne's north-west, 34 parents/caregivers applied for assistance. Of those, 33 students received tuition and 1 student was not able to be matched to a tutor.Of the 34 students who participated in the pilot Initiative in Melbourne's north-west, 19 students attended State schools and 15 students attended non-government schools.The Department does not hold identified data on the improvement in reading achievement of individual students. The evaluation of the pilot Initiative shows that over 80% of responding parents felt their child had improved in reading and enjoying reading and 85% felt their child had increased their confidence in reading, while 69% of responding tutors felt most or all of the students they tutored had improved in reading.No data has been collected that addresses this question.</DOC>

This program included the gifting of a mobile DVI laboratory, totalled $40,000.3. The AFP Law Enforcement Cooperation Program (LECP) also manages the Philippines Counter Terrorism Capacity Building project which is jointly funded by the AFP and AusAID. The project has a budget of $1,637,500.00 million in the 2005  -  06 financial year.

and (2). Yes. Progress reports provided to the Department of Education Science and Training by Macarthur Youth Commitment indicate that the program has contributed to the outcomes quoted. An evaluation of the program which is being conducted by the Macarthur Youth Commitment is scheduled to be completed by the end May 2006.and (4). I am aware that the Macarthur Youth Commitment recently approached the Government for funding to continue their operations post the end of June this year for a further six months.The Australian Government has implemented Career Advice Australia (CAA). This initiative is helping young people make informed decisions about their future. CAA is a part of the Australian Government's vision that every young person should find and achieve their potential.The expanded role of Local Community Partnerships under CAA will facilitate assistance for all young people aged 13 - 19, including the 'lesser at risk' cohort of students who have historically received general career advice and information-based assistance under the former Jobs Pathway Programme. The services to be facilitated through Local Community Partnerships include: individual transition plans; career advice; structured workplace learning and advice and information on vocational education; and training pathways and opportunities.The facilitation of these support services to all secondary students through schools and Local Community Partnerships under CAA has allowed the new Youth Pathways to focus on assisting those young people who are most at risk of disengaging from education.The replacement of the Jobs Pathway Programme with Youth Pathways reflects the Australian Government's desire to avoid duplication of effort in assistance for young people across jurisdictions. Participant numbers for Youth Pathways were determined based on a number of factors including the programme budget and the cost of delivering the more intensive personalised case management services. The proportional distribution of the 17,000 participant numbers to each Service Region was based on ABS Census data (unemployed 15-to-19 year old early school leavers). This was the most reliable data available to indicate the distribution of the number of at-risk young people and the most equitable basis on which to allocate the funding and business levels in a nationally consistent way.Transition support services for this area will be delivered by a number of organisations that have been contracted following open and competitive tenders and funding applications.Analysis of the assistance historically provided through the former JPP indicates that 42% received general career information/advice; 25% was job search related and 33% was personalised and customised assistance. Many of the students that used to be supported by JPP and the Transition Brokers could be expected to be assisted under the CAA initiative. In addition, young people (16 year olds who have left school) can now receive employment related assistance from Job Network's Intensive Support Job Search Training and/or Intensive Support Customised Assistance. Job Network services provide more intensive employment based assistance than was available under JPP.While acknowledging the good work that has been done by the Macarthur Youth Commitment, the Government has increased resources through the services in place under the CAA initiative, and the new Youth Pathways for those young Australians who are the most at risk.</DOC>

A number of greenhouses were purchased for this purpose by a consortium of US donors, including Mr Wolfensohn, co-ordinated by the Aspen Institute. The cost of these buybacks was approximately USD 14 million, and the Palestinian Authority contributed around USD 20 million for greenhouse refurbishment.There was no formal evaluation of the programme made by either the Australian Representative Office in Ramallah or AusAID. No funding for the project was provided by the Australian Government.The greenhouses and packing houses employed approximately 2,700 full-time workers and 1,800 part-time harvest employees. Approximately 600 security guards were also employed.No. Australia's Representative Office in Ramallah is unaware of any such claims.I understand that greenhouses located at Morag were taken or destroyed during the period from 11 to 14 May as a result of a land ownership dispute by two prominent Gaza families. The replacement cost of these is estimated by USAID at USD 1 million. Since the Israeli withdrawal, approximately 500 dunums (equivalent to 125 acres) of greenhouses have been destroyed. USAID estimates the replacement cost for these greenhouses overall at approximately USD 5 million.The greenhouses that were destroyed since the Israeli withdrawal have been purchased by the donor group organised by Mr Wolfensohn.</DOC>

Yes, Defence has personnel and procurement policies covering post separation employment which apply to ADF and civilian Defence personnel.Yes. Copies of Defence Instruction (General) PERS 25-4 - Notification of Post Separation Employment, Defence Instruction (General) PERS 25-6 - Conflict of Interest and Acceptance of Offers of Gifts and Hospitality, the Defence Workplace Relations Manual and the Defence Procurement Policy Manual have been forwarded separately to your office.There is no waiting period.Defence's policies in relation to post separation employment do not restrict former Defence personnel from taking up employment, but Defence provides guidance on their obligations regarding disclosure of official, commercially valuable or in-confidence information gained in the course of their employment with Defence prior to their separation. The policies encourage personnel to submit a letter of notification through their chain of command if they receive an offer of employment which could give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest.Separate policies exist that refer specifically to undertaking outside employment while on leave.For ADF personnel, the approving authority is the Commanding Officer or Branch Head, with the exception of applications where the employment is to be undertaken outside Australia. The approving officer in this circumstance is the Deputy Service Chief or an officer not below the rank of Brigadier. For civilian personnel, the approving authority is the employee's line manager or, in the case of a request for long service leave, the Civilian Personnel Administration Centre delegate.Yes. Defence has procurement policy which requires tenderers to seek prior written approval from Defence in certain circumstances before allowing former Australian Public Service and ADF personnel to contribute to a tender response for a Defence requirement or to contribute to, or perform, a Defence contract.The RAAF Officer did not have approval to work in off-duty hours at the time that the work in question was undertaken. The member's Commanding Officer has since provided retrospective approval for this off-duty employment.The matter was investigated by the Inspector-General and the Regional Information and Communication Technology Market Testing project's probity adviser and legal counsel. It was concluded that the company received no improper or unfair advantage through employing the officer in the preparation of the tender response. All tenderers have been advised that the company would not be excluded from the tender process.This is a market testing project. The possible outcomes are that the in-house option is successful or the services are outsourced to a private provider. A formal contract would be entered into only under the latter outcome. The value of the contract would depend on a number of factors, but is likely to be in the range of $30m to $37m per year for possibly up to nine years.Yes.</DOC>

No. Defence is planning to withdraw the instruction as it no longer meets Commonwealth and Defence policy requirements. Future contracting for civilian health practitioners will be undertaken using current approved Defence contracting templates.Chapter 4.10 of the Defence Procurement Policy Manual states '_wherever possible, it is strongly recommended that contracts not be entered into with natural persons.' A natural person is defined as an individual rather than a company or partnership, who contracts to provide goods or services to Defence.The information requested is not readily available. Collation of the information requested would involve an unreasonable use of Defence resources to manually search through thousands of contract files around the country., (b), (c)      Defence is aware that a number of contractors were unhappy with the tender process and some have claimed irregularities with various aspects of the tender process.Defence is aware that some contractors were unhappy with the tender process and chose not to submit a tender.and (7) Defence is aware that some tenderers voluntarily withdrew from the tender process prior to the awarding of contracts. Information on their reasons for withdrawal from the tender process is not available. Defence is not aware of existing contractors 'resigning' because of the tender process. Contractors are unable to 'resign' per se, and have a contractual obligation to provide services until their contract expires. Contracts may be terminated early through mutual agreement between the contractor and Defence. This occurs from time to time for a variety of reasons. Defence does not keep information on the reasons for contractors seeking an early termination of their contract. Known reasons include poor health, changed family commitments, pregnancy, further education, and alternative full-time work., (b), (c) Vacancies caused by tenderers not proceeding to contract or terminating their contracts prior to their expiry date are filled either through accessing companies on the National Standing Offer Panel to provide the required services, or through an open tender process. All staff engaged by Defence are provided assistance at the local level to familiarise them with Defence procedures and documentation. It is not possible to separately identify information relating to tenderers terminating their contracts as a result of the National Standing Offer tender process.No. The overarching requirement for all Commonwealth procurement is value for money. Tenders with high technical merit and high prices may not represent good value for money. Defence enters negotiations with those tenderers that represent best value for money, and is under no obligation to enter negotiations with all tenderers.Individual health providers may improve their chances of gaining contract work with Defence if they tender through multiple entities. There were no formal discussions to this effect by Defence or Area Health Service South Queensland.Defence is not a party to negotiations between tenderers and their employees or potential employees over employment conditions, and is unable to comment on the matter raised in this question.No. However, the Statement of Work used in the recent tender process for medical officers, includes the mandatory qualifications and experience stated in the question.Yes.Yes.

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs administers a wide variety of programs to assist communities, many of which are routinely advertised and have quite comprehensive guidelines.
Information is publicly available at

I consider that the preparation of answers to the questions placed on notice would involve a significant diversion of resources and, in the circumstances, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.

The Australian Government also delivers part of its Natural Heritage Trust through regional delivery arrangements. Under these arrangements in New South Wales, Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) develop investment strategies, which are the basis for Australian Government investment from this component of the Trust.
The electoral division of Newcastle falls within the responsibilities of the Hunter/Central Rivers CMA. While community groups may be the ultimate beneficiaries of funding provided to CMAs through investment strategies, they do not apply directly to the Australian Government for these funds. The CMAs are responsible for allocating funding they receive amongst regional stakeholders according to regional priorities.

Living in Harmony community grants
The objectives of the Living in Harmony initiative are to encourage all Australians to contribute to and build upon Australia's social harmony, promote harmony and generate better understanding, respect and cooperation among people of different cultural backgrounds, reinforce Australia's common values, focusing on what makes us all Australians, and make it clear there is no place for racism in Australia, tackle racial intolerance and bigotry and address any pockets of intolerance there might be. The Living in Harmony community grants programme provides funding to non-profit community organizations for projects to raise awareness of the benefits of community harmony, and to address issues of racism.

Yes
In 2005, the total cost of these print advertisements was $61,314.00. To provide the cost of each advertisement would require an unreasonable diversion of departmental resources. The cost of advertising the 2005 Living in Harmony community grants round in the Newcastle Herald was $859.80.

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs administers a wide variety of programs to assist communities, many of which are routinely advertised and have quite comprehensive guidelines.
Information is publicly available at 
www.facsia.gov.au
 and in Annual Reports.
I consider that the preparation of answers to the questions placed on notice would involve a significant diversion of resources and, in the circumstances, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.

Yes.Ratification of a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) by the Philippines legislature is a matter for the Government of the Republic of the Philippines to comment on. In the meantime, Australia will continue to progress Defence cooperation activities with the Philippines such as training, education, seminars and professional exchanges.The conduct of any negotiations between the Governments of the Philippines and the United States is a matter for those two Governments to comment on. The Philippines first raised the possibility of a SOFA in February 2004 and formal negotiations commenced in December 2004. The current status of the negotiations is that the Philippines provided a counter-draft on 31 May 2006. Face-to-face negotiations aiming to agree a draft text can now follow. Formal approvals and legislative ratification will take longer.No.and (b) The purpose of the proposed reciprocal SOFA is to provide a more comprehensive legal framework for administrative arrangements to support Australian Defence Force and Armed Forces of the Philippines personnel engaged in Defence Cooperation training and exercise activities in our respective countries. The detailed provisions of the SOFA are still subject to negotiation, but there are no plans to permanently base Australian troops in the Philippines.and (b) Expenditure on counter terrorism assistance to the Philippines involves a range of Government agencies, coordinated through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), of which Defence provides one element. DFAT advise that for financial year 2005-06, $5,527,750 is currently allocated in total by Government agencies for counter terrorism support projects to the Philippines, with $3,672,392 having been spent in the current financial year to 31 March 2006.The Government cannot be sure of what terrorist organisations might be operating beyond those referred to in the question.and (b) The Malacca Strait is the sovereign territory of the littoral states. As such, they will determine the most appropriate method of securing the Strait from piracy and terrorist attack, and advise what assistance they would welcome from countries such as Australia. Australia will consider any request for assistance from the littoral states, and has provided advice based on our own experience with maritime security activities. At this stage, Defence is not providing any direct assistance. Nonetheless, it should be noted that Australia does promote security in the Strait, and more broadly in the region, by helping these countries improve their defence and security capabilities through a wide range of cooperative defence activities. These activities include training, education, seminars and bilateral and multilateral exercises.</DOC>

I am aware of the issues raised in the article.My Department engaged the Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) at Monash University to undertake economic modelling of the impact of aspects of the workplace relations reforms on key economic variables such as productivity, wages, employment and GDP. The aspects of workplace reform considered were changes to unfair dismissal laws, the benefits of moving to a national system and the changed wage-setting arrangements.Minimum wages can not fall under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005  -  (the Act). Under the Act, minimum wages will be protected at the level set after the inclusion of the increase from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's 2005 Safety Net Review and can not fall below this level.A number of economic gains are expected from WorkChoices such as increased productivity.Productivity improvements are expected to be driven by:the shift of workers reliant on awards to other methods of pay setting such as collective and individual agreements. A number of studies have indicated that workers on agreements exhibit higher productivity than those on awards; andfirms no longer having to divert as many resources to compliance tasks associated with two systems of industrial relations (federal and state).Employment growth will be stimulated by changes to the unfair dismissal laws which represented a barrier to employment. Further growth is expected through the simplification of procedures that employers must undertake to comply with workplace laws.The negative impact of the previous unfair dismissal laws was demonstrated by a study titled 'The Effect of Unfair Dismissal Laws on Small and Medium Sized Businesses' for the Department by Dr Don Harding of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research using the (then) Yellow Pages Business Index survey. The study was publicly released on 29 October 2002. It found that:the estimated costs to small to medium sized enterprises of complying with unfair dismissal laws amounted to $1.3 billion per year; and11.1 per cent of small to medium sized employers that did not have employees but previously did, were influenced by the unfair dismissal laws in deciding to reduce the number of workers they employed. This translated to the loss of 77,842 jobs in which unfair dismissal played some role (35,000 of those in which unfair dismissal laws played a major role).</DOC>

A maximum age limit of 70 currently applies to all employer contributions on behalf of a person (that is, employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements and other deductible employer superannuation contributions such as salary sacrifice contributions), with the exception of employer contributions which are required under an award or industrial agreement.In A Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation released on 9 May 2006, the Government announced a proposal to allow employers to make contributions on behalf of their employees up to age 75. An employer will be able to claim a full deduction for such contributions.Refer to the answer for question 1.The Government is committed to providing enhanced opportunities and greater choice for mature age workers, recognising that their skills, experience and ongoing contribution to the labour force will play a vital part in securing Australia's future economic strength.As part of this commitment, the Government has introduced a new Mature Age Worker Tax Offset for workers aged 55 and over. The offset provides a maximum annual tax rebate of $500 with effect from the 2004 - 05 income year. Eligibility for the offset is based solely on income from working, so that mature age Australians with income from working who also derive significant income from passive sources, such as superannuation and shares, can still benefit from the offset.To further encourage participation among mature aged workers, from 1 July 2005 individuals who have reached their superannuation preservation age and are still working can access their superannuation as a non-commutable income stream. This change recognises that older Australians may prefer to remain in the workforce but reduce their hours of work as they approach retirement. It allows people who wish to reduce their hours of work to supplement their employment income with income from superannuation. In A Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation the Government has proposed that from 1 July 2007 superannuation benefits paid from a taxed fund for people aged 60 and over would be free of tax. This proposal would boost incentives to work.In addition, the Government has changed the superannuation contribution rules for persons aged 65 to 74. As a result, with effect from 1 July 2004, a person does not have to work every week to make contributions into an account with a superannuation provider. This change recognises that Australians aged 65 to 74, who wish to work, may prefer irregular part-time or short term contract work rather than working every week.The Government increased the maximum employee age limit for employer contributions from age 65 to age 70 from 1 July 1997.In A Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation released on 9 May 2006, the Government announced a proposal to allow employers to make contributions on behalf of their employees up to age 75. An employer will be able to claim a full deduction for such contributions.It would be inappropriate to apply any increase in the maximum employee age limit retrospectively. All taxpayers require certainty in their application of the law, and retrospective application would reduce this certainty.</DOC>

The Detention Health Strategy is now a public document and a copy is attached.
Future Detention Health Strategy
Why is a new Detention Health Strategy needed?
The reports of Mr Palmer into the Cornelia Rau matter, Mr Comrie into the Vivian Alvarez matter and the recent Ombudsman's report on the case of Mr T, leveled a number of criticisms at the Department about how it related to people it came into contact regarding some enforcement provisions of the Migration Act 1958. Issues identified included the management of the mental health and wellbeing of people in immigration detention centres and in compliance activity. Following these reports the Australian Government has developed programs to improve health and mental health for people detained under the Migration Act 1958.
The delivery of appropriate and culturally responsive physical and psychological health services, including social support programs, is an essential component in the exercise of powers under the Migration Act 1958 to detain people who are suspected of being in Australia unlawfully. The observations of both Australian courts and recent inquiries into the operations of the Department, accepted in principle by the Australian Government, provide a clear mandate to significant improvements and change.

The provision of mental health screening, access to specialist services, and knowledge and awareness of mental illness across a range of departmental staff and staff employed by the Detention Service Provider;An understanding of procedures that address both the impact of mental illness on people in immigration detention and how they may relate to the Department;Understanding the effect detention and other enforcement transactions by the Department has on the health and emotional well being of people in immigration detention;Expanding the focus of health services from almost being exclusively focused on clinical care to paying attention to other aspects that impact on well being such as the environment, attitudes and practices of staff as well as psychosocial factors that people bring to their interactions; andSeparating the delivery of health services from being part of the security and enforcement arrangements for persons detained, so as to remove perceptions amongst external stakeholders that health care may be compromised.

Providing a greater emphasis on documenting what are fair and reasonable practices, responsibilities, training and support services that should be available across a range of immigration detention situations so the Department meets its duty of care responsibilities. Detention health provisions do not currently cover all types of detention situations;Having a more appropriate, efficient and less intrusive health assessment process. Health assessment processes that currently exist on entry/exit to detention are the same regardless of where, or how the client has become unlawful, or the circumstances of detention;Using an 'evidence based risk assessment approach' to health assessments in regard to both what is considered, the frequency, purpose and circumstances of such assessments, and the need for an assessment;Specifying the standard and level of health care a client should have access to across a range of detention settings and situations. This should encompass both an analysis of public health risk and an assessment of what is fair and reasonable and should reflect similar policies of provision and choice in the broader Australian community; andProviding the broad spectrum of a health framework which is not only concerned with disease management but with influencing positively some of the known determinants of poor health outcomes. This should encompass a range of health considerations from promotion and prevention to rehabilitation and future care.
Future Health Strategy - Summary
In light of the Department's duty of care responsibilities the future Detention Health Strategy will ensure people in immigration detention have access to health screening, physical examinations, primary and specialised care and emergency services. The future Detention Health Strategy will be based around the core principles of being open and accountable and will specify in the health assessment process the reasons for procedures and actions to be associated with findings; treatments that should always be available and those for which elective advice may be given; and how continuity of health care will be protected for people detained and when people leave detention.

Outline an appropriate and targeted health framework which sets strategies to ensure that both physical and mental health needs of people in all types of immigration detention are addressed across the spectrum of health promotion and prevention, early intervention, treatment and rehabilitation;Develop a risk assessment approach to screening for disease symptoms across the various types of situations in which people are in immigration detention;Provide care and management of physical and mental health problems in an individual context, taking into account health assessments and advice, cultural understanding of health needs, particularly past experiences of torture and/or trauma;Provide people in immigration detention with a description of the range and standard of health care they can expect when detained;Provide people in immigration detention with health services that are fair, reasonable, and commensurate with Australia's international obligations and available to the Australian community;Recognise the potential negative impacts on physical and psychosocial well-being of the detention event and of the uncertain outcome of visa applications;Be based on a professional health and mental health service being separate from the Detention Services contract;Be independently monitored and evaluated; andHave a funding program that is transparent and appropriate to providing access to a defined standard of health and mental health services.

Funding for the future Detention Health Strategy will support the Detention Health Branch and ensure that DIMA fulfils its responsibility to deal fairly and responsibly with all people detained under the Migration Act 1958, not just those in detention centres and includes a more appropriately targeted health program.
Novation of the health contracts will bring all payment and costing for the provision of health and mental health care under direct management of the Department. This will allow further work to take place to examine a variety of health funding mechanisms for small, but heterogenous populations in order that a more effective, transparent funding program can be established for the future detention health program.

Certain particulars of all contracts entered into, and guarantees and loans given under the National Interest Account are published in the Government Notice Gazette in accordance with Section 30 (1) of the EFIC Act.All facilities were provided in accordance with the EFIC Act. In particular, facilities were provided where there was sufficient trade or wider benefits to Australia. Under the EFIC Act, National Interest facilities may be provided under Ministerial Direction or Ministerial Approval. In some instances the Minister has directed EFIC to enter into facilities where transactions fell within parameters contained in the relevant Ministerial Direction. EFIC's Unsecured Advance Payment and Performance Bond Facility, former Export Working Capital Guarantee Facility and a Credit Insurance facility provided during the late-1990s north Asian economic crisis were implemented in this way. Other facilities were the subject of individual Ministerial approvals.</DOC>

Redundancy payments can be made to a person of any age. However, the taxation treatment of these payments varies depending on the recipient's age and length of service, and whether the payment qualifies as a bona fide redundancy payment.All lump sum payments made by employers upon termination of employment are eligible for concessional tax treatment, particularly if the recipient is aged 55 or over. Only five per cent of the pre-July 1983 component of a lump sum payment is subject to tax at a taxpayer's marginal tax rate while the remainder of this component is tax free. The post-June 1983 component up to an individual's relevant reasonable benefit limit (RBL) is taxed at a maximum rate of 30 per cent plus the Medicare levy. Where the recipient is aged 55 or over, the first $129,751 (in 2005-06) of the post-June 1983 component is taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent plus the Medicare levy.Where such payments qualify as bona fide redundancy payments, they are eligible for additional concessional tax treatment. Specifically, in 2005-06 the first $6,491 plus $3,246 for each year of completed service is tax free.Payments made by employers to individuals aged 65 or more do not qualify as bona fide redundancy payments. This treatment has applied since the provision was introduced in 1984 and reflects the fact that people aged 65 or over who are made redundant generally have ready access to other sources of income, such as the age pension.On 9 May 2006, the Government announced a plan to remove the complex tax arrangements and restrictions that apply to people's superannuation benefits. The proposals contained in A Plan to Simplify and Streamline Superannuation would simplify superannuation for retirees making it easier to understand, improve incentives to work and save, and provide greater flexibility over how superannuation savings can be drawn down in retirement.The plan does not propose to change the taxation treatment for bona-fide redundancy payments, approved early retirement scheme payments, or unused leave.However the plan does propose new arrangements for the taxing of employer eligible termination payments (ETPs). Under the plan it is proposed that employer ETPs would be comprised of two components. Firstly, the exempt component would be made up of any post-June 1994 invalidity amount and any pre-July 1983 amount. This component would be exempt from tax.Secondly, the taxable component would be the post-June 1983 amount. This would be taxed at 15 per cent for amounts up to $140,000 for recipients aged 55 and over and at 30 per cent for those aged under 55. Amounts in excess of $140,000 would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate.The Government will be consulting on the details of the plan until Wednesday, 9 August 2006.</DOC>

The Government announced an allocation of $305 million over six years across five agencies in February 2006 to address the tax mischief identified under Operation Wickenby. There are now over 100 officers working on Operation Wickenby. It is expected that this will rise to 250 by September 2006.At this stage, there are nine potentially criminal matters (involving 38 individuals) being investigated by the Australian Crime Commission.The vast majority of cases are still being profiled prior to audit or investigation activity. Tax audits have commenced on a small number of cases.There have been a number of court challenges to Australian Crime Commission processes. Overwhelmingly, these are being resolved in favour of the Commission, but they are causing some delays in the process of investigation.The amount that has been spent by the ATO on Operation Wickenby up until the end of May 2006 is approximately $7.4 million. This is an estimate because costs associated with people working on Operation Wickenby in the early stages were not separately accounted for.Operation Wickenby has its origin in action by the ATO in 2003. The ATO referred potential criminal activity in respect of suspicious tax haven transactions to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC). The ACC then commenced an investigation into money laundering and tax fraud under its Board-approved determination. Subsequent intelligence and information gathered by the Australian Crime Commission through the use of its coercive powers led to information identifying numerous promoters and participants, including a number of prominent Australians, who are allegedly utilising offshore services to avoid tax liabilities and commit fraud against the Australian taxation system.The ATO is continuing to investigate, and gather evidence in relation to, the initial promoter of the arrangements that are at the centre of Operation Wickenby. The ATO in liaison with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and law enforcement agencies will determine which cases to prosecute in accordance with its prosecution policy and the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth.The ATO does not undertake any phone tap activity.</DOC>

Yes.On the 14 March 2006, the Government released a discussion paper on a range of media reform issues entitled Discussion Paper on Media Reform Options.The discussion paper is another step in an ongoing process of consultation. The components of the package have been canvassed publicly over an extended period. On this basis, I consider that five weeks is an appropriate period of time for individuals and stakeholders to express their views on the contents of the discussion paper.</DOC>

In relation to part (1) of the question, a list of the commercial jet aircraft movements between the hours of 5am and 6am at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport is attached.Parts (2) and (3) of the question relate to ICAO aircraft noise certification levels. ICAO noise certification is based on a type certification process that is laid down in Volume I of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention. Under this system once an aircraft type (eg B747-400, B737-800, etc) is noise certificated all aircraft of that type are deemed to meet the standard. Individual aircraft cannot be tested against the standard using in-service noise and flight path monitoring systems. Nevertheless, broad correlations between in-service and certification noise levels are to be expected.ATTACHMENTList of Commercial Jet Operations During theCurfew Shoulder Period (5am to 6am)Note: All

Passenger space or seating room and the maximum number of seats that may be installed on an aircraft is a matter for the airline to determine, in conjunction with the aircraft manufacturer and the regulatory authority of the country of manufacture.The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) recognises these standards set by the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) 1998 Part 25.Minimum seat pitches for seating in particular rows of emergency exits on small to medium sized transport category aircraft, typically used in domestic interstate and intrastate air travel, are defined in Airworthiness Directive AD/General/73.CASA does regulate the design and tested strength of seats used in aircraft to ensure that the seat types, including the seat belts, have been tested to international standards.None.In 2001, the Government commissioned a study into the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), and its more serious consequence, pulmonary embolism (PE), associated with air travel. The Department of Health and Aged Care (now the Department of Health and Ageing (DOHA) carried out the study with funding from the Department of Transport and Regional Services.The objective of this study was to investigate the time relations between long haul air travel and venous thromboembolism. The report did not consider the size of seats and the space between rows of seats in the analysis.The study was completed in early 2003 and the findings confirmed that the risk of DVT and PE following a long-haul flight, for the average traveller, was small.The British Medical Journal published the outcomes of the study on 8 November 2003.</DOC>

ASIC does not have any programs and/or services for Indigenous communities or individuals specifically in the federal electoral district of Chifley.At a national level ASIC has done extensive research and policy work in relation to issues relating to Australia's Indigenous people.
Research
ASIC has identified problems associated with 'book up' (a form of credit offered by stores and other traders, often in return for some form of security), which is particularly common in regional and remote areas of Australia, and primarily involves Indigenous consumers.
 Some Consumer Problems, in 2002 following widespread research and consultation into these issues.
Education Resources

Moola Talk and No Free Moola are consumer resources covering a range of financial problems common in remote Indigenous communities. These consumer resources are easy to read comics with stories of everyday consumer issues to convey our consumer protection messages.
ASIC has also translated radio scripts based on these resources for Indigenous consumers and broadcast them on radio stations in the Northern Territory and Queensland.
The budget for this campaign was $100,000.
 A Guide is a comprehensive resource for anyone working on developing responses to book up in Aboriginal communities. It includes information about what consumers and communities can do to control or eliminate book up, how to promote good book up, how to find alternatives to book up, legal issues, sources of advice and assistance and how to raise levels of financial literacy. The Guide was launched on 15 December 2005.
The budget for this campaign was also $100,000.
Super and Us Mob! is a factsheet ASIC produced together with the Australian Taxation Office to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees better understand superannuation. The factsheet explains how superannuation works, when you are entitled to it as an employee, and outlines some of the key benefits of superannuation for working families.
The total production cost was paid by the Australian Taxation Office.
In addition to these resources, ASIC's Remote Areas Campaigns Officer and Indigenous graduates conduct community education or information sessions when visiting Indigenous communities.
Policy
ASIC's policy work listed below is intended to assist all Indigenous people in Australia.
ASIC participated in a number of workshops, together with other federal, state and territory government agencies, to develop the National Indigenous Consumer Strategy, which was released on 1 September 2005.
The aim of the Strategy is to improve Indigenous consumers' knowledge of their rights and obligations under consumer protection laws, improve the behaviour of traders and to promote effective engagement and partnership between consumer protection agencies, Indigenous organisations, business and other government agencies to improve consumer outcomes for Indigenous people.
ASIC has also been working cooperatively with other governments and the business community to improve the regulation of book up. On 16-17 November 2005 ASIC and the Northern Territory Government jointly sponsored a forum on book up in Alice Springs for key banking and regulatory agencies and released for public comment the Book Up Discussion Paper.
 A Guide.
 Licensing and disclosure relief for certain community representatives in remote communities, for approximately 75 Indigenous local councils in remote areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland communities without bank branches. The ASIC class order relieves certain people in communities in the Northern Territory and Queensland from the need to hold an Australian financial service licence (AFSL), where they arrange for the issue of, and/or provide financial product advice in relation to, certain basic deposit products issued by Westpac Banking Corporation.
ASIC has worked closely with the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and has provided feedback to ORAC on the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Bill 2005.
Other Resources
ASIC has recently employed a dedicated Remote Areas Campaigns Officer, whose role is to liaise with Indigenous communities in regional and remote areas, to assist in the identification of complaints or problems with financial services providers particularly affecting consumers in those communities.
In addition, ASIC also established a dedicated 1300 telephone number for Indigenous complainants to contact ASIC.
ASIC also has an Indigenous graduate program and has employed two Indigenous graduates since March 2005 under this program.
ASIC has developed links with many Government and private sector organisations that provide services to Indigenous people. For example, ASIC is a member of the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network steering committee and the National Indigenous Consumer Strategy Implementation Reference Group.
ASIC has a Consumer Advisory Panel (CAP) which was established in 1998. Its role is to advise ASIC on current consumer protection issues and give feedback on ASIC policies and activities.

GST Field Compliance and Advisory Work
The Indigenous compliance strategy works towards informing and educating Indigenous taxpayers, so they are able to voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. The strategy incorporates a combination of education, help and enforcement activity.
Field staff provide Indigenous non-profit organisations and some businesses with help and education through seminars, workshops and advisory visits, and by conducting field audits and single issue reviews.
By the end of the 2005-2006 financial year, it is anticipated the team will have delivered 30 seminars, assisted with 500 business activity statement non-lodger cases and about 800 other cases - a mixture of providing advice and obtaining verification information.
The cost of this program is estimated at $1,250,500 per annum.
Indigenous Communication
The ATO delivers marketing and education activities to special audiences, which includes Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The ATO provides Indigenous media with editorial programs which provide local media with tax features, press releases and targeted editorials addressing needs within specific communities. The ATO places relevant business activity statement advertising in Indigenous press each quarter.
The cost of this program is estimated at $184,910 per annum
National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Resource Centre
The Centre is based in Alice Springs and through its national connections provides a contact point between the ATO and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people throughout Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can call 131030 for the cost of a local call, and have their taxation enquiries answered by tax officers who are culturally trained to assist Indigenous Australians in tax matters.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Infoline has received more than 13,000 phone calls, year-to-date, with an expected volume of 16,500 by 30 June 2006.
The cost of this service is estimated at $324,000 per annum.
Tax Help Program
The Tax Help Program continues to expand the number of Indigenous Tax Help Centres, and the number of volunteers assisting taxpayers to do their tax returns during tax time each year. For the 2005 tax season, there were 38 Regional and Remote Indigenous centres. This is projected to increase to 40 in the 2006 tax season.
Costs for the 2005 year for Indigenous centres were approximately $114,000.
Indigenous Tax Advisory Group
The Indigenous Tax Advisory Group (ITAG) is made up of senior representatives from the ATO and Indigenous communities. The ITAG meets once a year and aims to promote discussion about delivery of ATO information and services to Indigenous communities and their intermediaries.
The cost of the ITAG program is estimated at $ 33,590 per annum
Seminars and Events
For the financial year to date, the ATO has conducted 34 information sessions for Indigenous groups, 23 of these sessions were conducted in NSW.

The Yabun Festival, held every Australia Day at Redfern Park, Sydney, where tax officers are available to provide information to the public on a range of tax matters.The 'Do It Right' program, a multi-agency initiative conducted by the NSW Office of Industrial Relations, delivering whole of government information to new and intending small business operators from Indigenous communities in Western Sydney and various regions in NSW.
This work is costed within the overall ATO taxpayer education program.
Indigenous Recruitment Program
The ATO has an Indigenous Employment Strategy, which includes funding for an Indigenous Liaison Officer and placements in the ATO for Indigenous students.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is considering how it can best engage with external stakeholders given its role as a converged regulator. The following committees have been established by ACMA under section 58 of the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005.
Name of Committee
Role of Committee
Consumer Consultative Forum (CCF) .The CCF was a forum in which representative consumer and user groups, provided advice to the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) and received information from the ACA on a range of telecommunications issues. Discussions in the CCF focussed on the 'carriage' of telecommunications services. The CCF membership is currently under review by ACMA.Law Enforcement Advisory Committee (LEAC)The LEAC provides advice and recommendations to the ACMA on law enforcement and national security issues relating to telecommunications.Emergency Services Advisory Committee (ESAC).ESAC is expected to provide advice to ACMA about issues relating to the emergency call service. It is in the process of being established. It has yet to meet.National Relay Service Consultative Committee (NRSCC)The NRSCC provides advice to ACMA in relation to its legislated responsibilities in monitoring the performance of the National Relay Service provider.Numbering Advisory Committee (NAC)The NAC is a formal advisory committee which provides advice and recommendations on issues related to ACMA's telecommunication numbering functions.International Radiocommunications Advisory Committee (IRAC)IRAC provides advice to ACMA on international radiocommunications matters, particularly in relation to international radiocommunications treaty, regulatory and standards activities in international fora.Communications Technical Regulation Advisory Committee (CTRAC)CTRAC was established to provide strategic policy advice and recommendations in respect of the compliance framework for technical regulation of communications in Australia.
Committee formed by Australian Communications Authority (ACA)
The following committee was established by the ACA and its continued operation is under review.
Radiocommunications Consultative CouncilThe RCC was the primary consultative forum for radiocommunications. It focused particularly on proposed changes to policies and procedures to meet the challenges presented by the demand for new services and the introduction of new technologies.
The Australian Broadcasting Authority did not establish any formal committees of the nature indicated in the question.
Committee Memberships are listed in Attachment A.Funding by ACMA to non-government organisations involved in these committees is limited to providing some support (limited out-of-pocket expenses, but not sitting fees) to consumer representative organisations for attendance at meetings.It would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources for the Department to investigate whether any particular funding payments were made to any of the over 70 non-government organisations listed in response to part (2) over an unlimited period of time and in relation to an unspecified range of matters. If the member has questions regarding specific non-government organisations and funding provided by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts during a specified period a response could be considered.to (c) Within the last five years ACMA and its antecedent organisations have received submissions and representations from non-government advisory committee members to numerous public discussion papers covering a range of issues.unding by ACMA to non-government organisations involved in these committees is limited to providing some support (limited out-of-pocket expenses, but not sitting fees) to consumer representative organisations for attendance at meetings.Isolated Children's Parents' Association; andYouth Action and Policy AssociationOther organisations may also contribute to issues relating to the needs of children but not in a specialised manner.

There are a number of 'Beyond Kyoto' reports and I am uncertain as to which of these reports the honourable member is referring.I can confirm, however, that I have publicly stated that I acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which indicates the world will need global reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in the order of 60 per cent by the end of this century.That is why the Australian Government is working so hard for an effective global response to this critical issue and investing almost $2 billion in initiatives to reduce our domestic greenhouse gas emissions.I am aware of the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS), released in September 2005. The Australian Government welcomed this report which involved input from more than 200 international scientists and government officials from more than 100 countries.The report draws on peer-reviewed literature and provides a snapshot of the status of the technology, drawing out the current knowledge about opportunities, challenges and risks. Importantly, the report represents an increasing global consensus between researchers and government policy makers on the integrity of carbon capture and storage as an option for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.The report indicates that the current estimates of the cost of CCS cover a wide range and significant cost reductions are expected in the next decade or two as the technology develops. Current cost estimates differ according to the specific technology, and the assumptions and models underpinning those costs. There is no mention of a cost comparison to wind in the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage. Different reports also ascribe different costs to energy from wind, depending for example on whether or not they include costs associated with transmission to grid as well as electricity generation.The Australian Government's approach is to invest in the development and commercialisation of a range of new low emissions technologies (whether they are fossil fuel or renewable based) as well as reducing impediments to the uptake of existing low emissions technologies.The ABARE has produced a number of reports that include carbon capture and storage technologies. These are based on models of hypothetical scenarios, and do not represent their views or expectations of likely futures.The Australian Government's Energy White Paper Securing Australia's Energy Future recognised that demonstrating the commercial application of CCS technologies is likely to take at least ten years. Nevertheless, their potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions released to the atmosphere mean that it is an important part of a portfolio of technologies required to address climate change.See responses to questions 2 and 3.The ABARE report does not make predictions as to global emissions, rather it presents a number of illustrative scenarios of the relative impact of different rates of technology take up in Partner countries. The scenarios deliberately include quite specific assumptions, which are not intended as representing likely outcomes, but illustrate the relative effects of assuming different drivers of combinations of technology take up across a range of sectors and countries. The report deliberately focuses only on the possible effects of activities under the Partnership and does not, for example, take into account the large number of other measures that are being implemented across other sectors and elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless, the report concludes that the Partnership has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse emissions compared to a business as usual scenario.The Asia-Pacific Partnership is not in competition with the Kyoto Protocol. As made clear in the Partnership's vision statement, the partnership will be consistent with and contribute to Partners' efforts under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and will complement, but not replace, the Kyoto Protocol. A key feature of the Partnership is that it has effectively engaged key developing country emitters in practical climate change action. It also provides industry with an opportunity to participate in practical climate efforts. Action will focus on the development and deployment of the breakthrough technologies needed for a comprehensive response to climate change.The Government will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol because, while it has some positive elements, it does not provide a comprehensive or environmentally effective long-term response to climate change and there is no clear pathway for action by developing countries. Without commitments by all major emitters, the Kyoto Protocol will deliver only about a 1 per cent reduction in the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions. Put another way, global greenhouse emissions are still expected to increase by 40 per cent on 1990 levels by 2012 under the Kyoto Protocol, compared to an increase of 41 per cent without it.The best scientific advice is that significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will be needed by the end of the century. Australia is therefore working actively with other countries to develop a global response to climate change that is environmentally effective, economically efficient, involves all major emitters, and will reduce global greenhouse gases to the levels that scientists tell us are needed.This country contributes just 1.46 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even if Australia switched off all our power stations today  -  shutting down all schools, hospitals, factories, heaters and air conditioners  -  the greenhouse gas savings would be completely replaced by increased emissions from China's booming power sector in less than 12 months.The Government's participation in the Asia-Pacific Partnership is an important part of this international effort as the Partnership brings together key countries (Australia, China, India, Korea, Japan and the United States) to explore ways to develop, deploy and transfer cleaner, more efficient technologies that the world will need to make the required deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of the Partnership is clear when you consider that between them these six partners account for almost half of the world's population, gross domestic product, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Distinctive features of the Partnership include the way it seeks to address climate change, air pollution, energy security and sustainable development in an integrated manner, and fully engages business in developing and implementing solutions. The Australian Government has committed $100 million over 5 years to the Partnership.The Government remains committed to Australia's target of limiting emissions to 108 per cent of 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Australia is on track to meet this target.See the responses to questions (1), (2), (3) and (4)The Australian Government believes that energy from a range of renewable sources will play an important role in both securing our energy future and addressing climate change. The Government is working with industry to identify and reduce impediments which may prevent greater uptake of these energy sources.Similarly, the Australian Government agrees with the IPCC special report on carbon capture and storage on the integrity of the technologies as a key option for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.The Government is investing in the development of a range of low emissions technologies (both renewable and fossil-fuel based) to ensure we meet our Kyoto target in the short term, and to help achieve future cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.The world first MRET scheme was designed to 'kick start' the renewable energy industry in Australia and it has been highly successful in doing so, generating around $3 billion in investment.The Government decided not to increase the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target because this would impose significant economic costs through higher electricity prices. The Government considers the most effective strategy for achieving long-term greenhouse emission reductions is to promote the development and demonstration of a broad range of low emission technologies, and address impediments to the uptake of renewable energy.The Government is supporting the development of renewable technologies through programmes such as the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, the $75 million Solar Cities programme, the $100 Renewable Energy Development Initiative, and measures to promote electricity storage technologies and improve wind forecasting.The Australian Government's $2 billion climate change strategy includes a broad range of measures designed to ensure we meet our Kyoto target in the short term, and to help deliver future cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. These include, for example, the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund; $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative; action on energy efficiency; $75 million Solar Cities programme; Greenhouse Challenge Plus (incorporating Greenhouse Friendly and Generator Efficiency Standards); Greenhouse Gas Abatement programme; Local Greenhouse Action (including Cities for Climate Protection; and Greenhouse Action in Regional Australia.See answer to question 2.</DOC>

Yes.Yes. Qantas operate CCTV cameras in those parts of Sydney Airport for which it has a lease, or other operational control over. It is not appropriate for me to provide details of location and type of camera for security reasons.See answer to question (2).Qantas has responsibility for the footage it records on CCTV. Should a Qantas controlled CCTV camera record footage of an aviation security incident, Qantas is required under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to report that incident to my Department. An aviation security incident means an unlawful interference with aviation or a threat of unlawful interference with aviation. The term 'unlawful interference with aviation' is defined in section 10 of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004.Routine surveillance is a matter for Qantas. Footage would be shared with the relevant authorities if necessary.</DOC>

Yes. Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) currently has approximately 800 closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras in operation at Sydney Airport, including cameras installed in the baggage handling areas in Terminal One and Terminal Two of Sydney Airport.In addition to SACL, organisations responsible for camera surveillance in areas of Sydney International Airport include the Australian Customs Services and Qantas Airways Limited. Other organisations and airport tenants have their own security camera systems to meet their internal security requirements. It is not appropriate for me to provide further details for security reasons.SACL has an approved Transport Security Program in place. The Program provides how CCTV cameras are utilised to support security measures in place on the airport site.Should a SACL controlled CCTV camera record footage of an aviation security incident, SACL is required under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to report that incident to my Department. An aviation security incident means an unlawful interference with aviation or a threat of unlawful interference with aviation.

I am advised that the following portfolio agencies paid for massages for their staff in 2005:
Australian Customs Service
Yes. The total cost was $5,756. Customs provided massages for its staff as a practical way to help alleviate body stressing given the extensive hours worked by some staff.The approximate cost per massage was $17.50.329 staff.
Australian Federal Police
The AFP paid for massages in the first two weeks of the Tsunami Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) response in Thailand during January 2005. These were provided for the Australian DVI team that at the time was standing for up to 16 hours a day performing mortuary duties.The details of the sum spent and the number of staff involved is not able to be extracted without considerable use of staff resources.The team consisted of 23 AFP and 16 State Police members. Not all members made use of the service.
Australian Law Reform Commission
Yes. The total cost was $396.$17.22 per massage.23 staff.
Federal Court of Australia
Yes. The total cost was $2,625. The Court has had a number of costly compensation cases related to overuse injury over the past 10 years and has implemented a range of strategies to address this problem, including offering massages to staff in some District Registries. Typically staff meet half the cost.The cost varies from State to State but amounted to $10 on average. Overall the cost ranged from $6 - $16.50 per massage.52 staff, but typically each staff member had more than one massage as part of the program.
Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia
Yes. The total cost was $195.00. As part of an OH&amp;S strategy and a preventive measure to minimise absenteeism due to stress and work related overuse injuries (Occupational Overuse Syndrome), a 'corporate massage' arrangement was introduced in the South Australian branch of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA). This enables employees to have a 15-20 minute massage each fortnight. Employees meet this cost however the SA branch finance one massage per employee, per annum.$15 per massage.13 staff.
National Native Title Tribunal
Yes. The total cost was $150.$15 per massage.10 staff.No other portfolio agency paid for massages for staff in 2005.Note - The Attorney-General's Department and Federal Magistrates Court have a certified agreement with staff that includes re-imbursement of up to $100 per employee, per annum, for health and well-being activities, which can include massage therapy.In addition, some injured staff with an approved workers' compensation claim may have had therapeutic massages approved by a medical practitioner as part of an agreed rehabilitation and return to work program. Comcare meets the payment and administration of these costs in their role as the administering authority for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</DOC>

Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources
As part of its promotion of a healthy lifestyle, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources has in place a healthy lifestyle subsidy. Staff members are entitled to claim reimbursement of eligible costs related to healthy living up to an amount of $110 per calendar year. Massage costs are an eligible item under this subsidy, however they must be provided outside the employees' work times and away from the workplace. In 2005, a total of 875 healthy lifestyle subsidy claims were made with reimbursements totalling $89,355.44. To determine specific massage related costs and usage rates would require individual examination of each claim. Such a process would require an unreasonable diversion of resources.
IP Australia
IP Australia spent a total of $3,176.00 on massages for staff in 2005.The cost per massage varied from $37.00 to $160.00 each.Ten staff received the massages.

Yes.The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is the Commonwealth regulatory agency responsible for the regulation of therapeutic goods in Australia.The Government has no position on the suitability of RU486 (mifepristone) for use in Australia because the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug for general marketing has not been assessed by the TGA. This is because no sponsor has ever applied to register RU486 in Australia.Inclusion of a therapeutic product in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods allows for the marketing and supply of the product in Australia. Section 30 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 provides that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing (or her delegate) may cancel the registration of a product under certain circumstances. Cancellation of the registration of the product means that the product can no longer be legally marketed and supplied in Australia. This may take effect immediately in circumstances where it appears that failure to cancel the registration would create an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. In other circumstances, the sponsor may have the opportunity to submit additional information addressing the basis of the proposed action before a decision is made. The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, in its entirety, is available from the ComLaw website: http://www.comlaw.gov.au.Before a prescription medicine can be marketed in Australia it needs to be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). In order to register a new medicine in Australia a sponsor needs to submit an application together with data demonstrating the quality, safety and effectiveness of the product when used as intended.The TGA requires that when companies lodge applications for approval of medicines they provide all studies related to that use, published or not, positive or negative, and all information relevant to the safety of the medicine.As RU486 is not a registered product in Australia, it is not able to be marketed in Australia.</DOC>

Customs CCTV control room operators undertake a regular routine survey of the position and operation of each of the cameras in operation at Sydney International Airport. At the time of the incidents Customs owned and operated 270 cameras at Sydney International Airport. During a regular review it was noted by the Customs officer that, on one occasion, one of the cameras in question was not functioning properly. On two separate occasions, it was noted that a camera was pointing in the wrong direction. The Customs maintenance contractor fixed the cameras following notification by Customs of the faults, as follows:On 23 October 2004, camera 1 was reported as having 'no focus'. This fault was fixed on 29 October 2004On 26 January 2005, camera 2 was reported as 'facing wall'. This fault was fixed on 2 February 2005On 30 January 2005, camera 1 was reported as 'facing wall'. This fault was fixed on 2 February 2005The cameras were located in the baggage make-up area at Sydney International Airport. Providing details about the exact location of the cameras on the public record could potentially harm the effectiveness of Customs' operations.The Customs cameras in the baggage make up area are intended to capture images of baggage or cargo of interest to Customs which includes baggage handling activities. It is important to note the Customs CCTV system has built-in redundancy and full operation effectiveness was maintained at all times because of the overlapping fields of view of Customs cameras.Customs does not have a record of any impropriety in the baggage make-up area during this period.The cameras in question were Customs owned, controlled and operated cameras.Yes. Customs has investigated the incidents and there is no evidence of misconduct. Customs has reviewed operational procedures to ensure that episodes of suspected interference are quickly discovered, rectified, reported and dealt with by the appropriate authorities.Yes. Customs CCTV control room operators undertake a regular routine survey of the position and operation of each camera at Sydney International Airport. Providing details on the public record about the frequency of the regular reviews could potentially harm the effectiveness of Customs' operations.Refer to Question 7 above.See answer to Question 1 above.Customs and the Customs Sydney International Airport maintenance contractor, Bemac Security Pty Ltd.All three incidents of faults reported on these cameras have not reoccurred since correction.As noted in response to Question 6, Customs has reviewed and instituted improved operational procedures to ensure that episodes of suspected interference are quickly discovered, rectified, reported and dealt with by the appropriate authorities.Customs has built-in redundancy in the CCTV system and full operational effectiveness was maintained at all times because of the overlapping fields of view of Customs cameras.Customs officers access the baggage make-up area. Employees and contractors engaged by other organisations, such as the airlines, the airport owner and security firms, also have access to the baggage make-up area. Customs does not have information in relation to employees and contractors of other organisations.In the course of their normal duties baggage handlers employed by the various employers at Sydney International Airport, including QANTAS, have access to the baggage make-up areas in order to discharge their duties. Access control to the baggage make-up area is exercised by the airport operator, Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL).No Customs CCTV cameras were stolen during the period or at any other time.There were other Customs CCTV cameras in the baggage make-up area at Sydney International Airport. They did not record any person tampering with the cameras.The only incidents since January 2005 involving Customs cameras occurred in April 2006. Two instances of damage affecting two Customs cameras at Sydney International Airport were reported. One camera was water damaged during external cleaning of the airport building and the other camera was dislodged from its housing above a baggage belt. This dislodgement appeared to have occurred during normal operational activity carried out in the area. These incidents have been investigated by Customs and it was determined that the damage was accidental not intentional tampering.Customs is unable to answer this question on behalf of other agencies and entities at Sydney Airport.</DOC>

The Government asked Defence to examine the feasibility of coordinated patrols with Indonesia in mid-2005. 'Coordinated patrols', not 'joint patrols', aim to maximise the on-station capability of each navy through information exchanges, sharing a maritime surveillance picture and better scheduling of patrols. During the Australia/Indonesia Navy talks in August 2005, the Royal Australian Navy proposed coordinated naval patrols with the Indonesian Navy. Both sides agreed to examine the feasibility of such a proposal.Australia and Indonesia have planned to resume the patrol boat exercise, Cassowary, later this year. This exercise (last held in 1999) focuses on maritime surveillance and response activities and will be useful in determining operational procedures for future coordinated patrols.A decision has not been made regarding these issues. The outcomes of exercise Cassowary will help Australia and Indonesia to mutually determine the potential scope of coordinated patrols, should they go ahead.Yes. I am regularly informed by Defence on progress regarding Australia's proposal for coordinated patrols.The Chief of Navy and I discussed the proposal for coordinated patrols with the Indonesian Chief of Navy during his visit to Australia in March 2006. The Royal Australian Navy continues to manage this initiative. No date has been set for the commencement of the patrols.The proposal for coordinated patrols is still under consideration and no date has been set for the commencement of the patrols.See my response to part (2). I cannot comment on which ships Indonesia might contribute to any patrols.No. Coordinated patrols will be scheduled into the Royal Australian Navy's existing fleet schedule and will not detract from existing patrol boat surveillance.</DOC>

An information campaign will be established to encourage indigenous communities to report illegal foreign fishing vessels. These communities are engaged in quarantine surveillance activity through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) program under arrangements with AQIS which provides for payments to communities on a fee-for-service basis.</DOC>

When Australian patrol vessels respond to a sighting of an illegal foreign fishing vessel, it can carry out one of two actions. It can apprehend the vessel and detain the crew via an administrative detention process while the suspected offence is investigated, or it can seize the catch and gear on board and release the vessel.The administrative detention of apprehended foreign fishers is required to provide Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) officials with sufficient time to investigate suspected illegal foreign fishing offences and prepare briefs of evidence for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to make a decision whether a case exists to charge the fishers with an offence.Administrative seizure of catch and gear are an efficient means of enforcement in situations where the apprehension of vessels is not considered to be the optimal response for operational reasons, such as in situations where there are higher priority targets. The Government's intention is to seek the maximum number of apprehensions, resulting in administrative detention, possible. The funding announced for the 2006-07 Budget will greatly increase the number of apprehensions of illegal foreign fishing vessels per year.No, I am not able to confirm that the success rate of illegal foreign fishers is higher than 90 per cent because the available data does not allow this estimate to be made.and (b) The recent measures announced as part of the 2006-07 Budget to boost the Australian Government's efforts to combat illegal foreign fishing operations will effectively reduce any incentives to fish illegally in Australian waters.Yes. As part of the 2006-07 Budget, the Australian Government has funded enforcement agencies to more than double the number of annual apprehensions made during 2005.</DOC>

The Joint Offshore Protection Command (JOPC) was established on 30 March 2005.JOPC is an interagency partnership, with officers from Customs and Defence working together in a common command and control structure to deliver whole-of-Government outcomes in relation to the identification of, and response to, threats in Australia's maritime domains.The Commander of the JOPC is a serving Navy Rear Admiral who is also Director General Coastwatch. Under a joint accountability arrangement, the Command reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Australian Customs Service for its civil functions and the Chief of the Defence Force for its military functions. The constituent elements of JOPC are the Coastwatch Division of Customs, Defence's Northern Command and a small headquarters. The Deputy Director General Coastwatch is the Deputy Commander JOPC (Customs) and the Commander Northern Command is Deputy Commander JOPC (Defence).Officers are subject to the human resource policies and conditions of service of their parent agency.Eighty-six JOPC staff are Customs personnel in the range of Customs Officers Bands 1 to 5. Northern Command has 102 personnel, including Australian Public Servant staff and Australian Defence Force (ADF) staff of various ranks. Many of the Northern Command staff have additional responsibilities, such as those that fall within Defence Aid to the Community commitments.The JOPC is not a separate Commonwealth agency and therefore no additional positions have been transferred to it. All positions that fall within the JOPC partnership remain either Customs or Defence positions.As JOPC is an inter-agency partnership, no funding has been allocated to it. Forward Estimates for JOPC responsibilities are contained in Output 4 of the Australian Customs Service Portfolio Budget Statements and Outcome 1 of the Department of Defence Portfolio Budget Statements.All ADF personnel within the JOPC ultimately report to the Minister for Defence.There are two embedded units within JOPC: the Coastwatch Division of Customs and Defence's Northern Command. Headquarters JOPC staff have been drawn from positions within those two units.For the total number of personnel and their levels see my response to part (2).There are three SES equivalent positions within JOPC: the Commander JOPC, the Deputy Commander (ADF) and the Deputy Commander (Customs).There are no plans to embed other agencies within JOPC. However, as a result of decisions taken within the 2006-07 Budget process, staff representing the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Customs Enforcement Operations Coordination Unit will be located in Headquarters JOPC. Additionally, the Customs National Marine Unit has outposted a Liaison Officer to Northern Command.The Command operates under a Directive signed by the CEO of Customs and the Chief of the Defence Force. The success of its operation will be assessed against this directive and the performance measures of its constituent units.</DOC>

In general terms, the ability of individual radars to detect wooden fishing vessels is dependent on a range of conditions prevailing at the time including, but not limited to, the size of the boat, sea state, weather and distances involved and the frequency and anti-clutter capabilities of the radar.
Similarly, the capability of satellite equipment is dependent on the nature of the satellite and the sensors onboard, together with other factors, such as revisit times.
Defence and Customs assets operating in support of the responsibilities of the Joint Offshore Protection Command use specialised equipment in operations to detect relevant threats in Australia's maritime zones.

AFP inquiries resulted in the arrest of two men on Wednesday 17 September 2003. They were charged with the offence of stealing under section 131.1(1) Criminal Code Act 1995.Both men appeared in court. These men pleaded guilty to charges relating to the theft and were sentenced on 19 November 2004 to significant periods of community services.$2.145m was allocated to enhancing the security of Customs network server rooms, including those at International Terminal Buildings in each state.Most work for this project has been completed, with only minor delays in some areas due to lack of availability of equipment and qualified tradespersons to work in regional offices.A second phase of this project has been undertaken to review all server hardening activities, and to assess that all remaining Customs sites have been adequately upgraded to manage the outcomes of this review process and to approve any new works that have been identified. Any further improvements that might be identified will be progressed through normal business including regular Protective Security Risk Reviews (PSRR) and annual Work Area Security Risk Review (WASRR) processes.</DOC>

Yes.The Customs fixed cameras at Sydney International Airport are Ikegami, Panasonic or Sony cameras. The pan tilt zoom cameras are Sensormatic mini domes.CCTV units are selected, installed and maintained by Customs for operational suitability. CCTV footage is of recognised high quality and, amongst other things, is used in courts of law to assist in prosecutions.Customs has not had any incidents where the CCTV footage produced by Customs cameras was of such a low technical quality that it was of no evidentiary value in criminal proceedings. Customs cannot answer on behalf of other Commonwealth and State agencies about CCTV footage produced by cameras owned or operated by them.</DOC>

Approximately 107 kilometres is unduplicated. Unduplicated sections are Coolac (about 11.9 kilometres); Sheahan Bridge, Gundagai (about 1.2 kilometres); Tarcutta (about 10.5 kilometres); Kyeamba Hill (about 9.1 kilometres); Little Billabong (about 7.9 kilometres); Holbrook (about 19 kilometres); Woomargama Gap to Table Top (about 40.2 kilometres); and Ettamogah to Lavington (about 7.7 kilometres), which is being undertaken as part of the Albury-Wodonga Hume Freeway Upgrade.The current approved project cost for the Coolac bypass is $145 million. The allocation for the duplication of the Sheahan Bridge provided in the 2006 Budget is $43 million. Current estimated project costs provided by the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) in October 2005 to duplicate other two-lane sections of the Highway are as follows: Tarcutta section: $100-160 million; Kyeamba Hill section: $75-130 million; Little Billabong section: $65-120 million; Holbrook section: $185-280 million; Woomargama Gap to Table Top: $340-570 million.The sum of these figures is $953-$1,448 million.The Australian Government has set the objective of completing the duplication of the Hume Highway by 2012.Construction of the Ettamogah to Lavington section is underway as part of the Albury-Wodonga Hume Freeway upgrade, which will be completed by mid 2007. Preconstruction, such as planning and environmental approvals is underway on all the other projects. Land acquisition has been carried out on the Coolac bypass.The Coolac bypass and Sheahan Bridge duplication will be completed by 2008-09.As announced in the 2006-07 Budget, the Australian Government, provided an additional $800 million to New South Wales in 2005-06 to enable the completion of duplication of the remaining sections of the Hume Highway by the end of 2009, except for three short sections through Tarcutta, Holbrook and Woomargama, totalling about 20 kilometres of road, which will be bypassed. This work requires more complex planning, consultation and environmental assessments.It is intended that these tasks be completed by 2008-09, so that construction can then be commenced. This will enable construction of these sections to be completed by 2012.See answer to question (3) above.The Department of Transport and Regional Services does not have an annual breakdown of crash statistics on the Hume Highway. However, RTA statistics show that from 2001 to 2005, total crashes for each section were as follows:SectionFatal (a)Casualty (b)Tow-away (c)Coolac63135Sheahan Bridge, Gundagai023Tarcutta (rural only)0916Kyeamba Hill22440Little Billabong01113Holbrook12423Woomargama Gap to Table Top92737       Number of crashes involving fatalities (some involving more than one fatality)Number of crashes involving casualties, excluding crashes involving fatalities (some may involving more than one injury).Number of crashes involving towaways, excluding crashes involving fatalities or casualties.The Albury-Wodonga Hume Freeway Upgrade Project is expected to be finished in mid 2007. The Australian Government's contribution to the project is $518.2 million, including $5.8 million towards the cost of the Bandiana Link to the Hume Freeway.</DOC>

No.
(a), (b), (c) and (d) On 5 October 2001, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP, announced that he accepted the RTA's recommendations and that future planning for the bypass should proceed on the basis of the Eastern route.
On 9 May 2006, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon Warren Truss MP, and I announced that the Murrumbateman bypass and Barton Highway duplication from the border of the Australian Capital Territory to the Murrumbateman bypass would receive up to $20.0 million in the period to the end of 2008-09 to allow construction to start after 2008-09. These funds will be used to complete planning and design, including conduct of an Environmental Impact Study (EIS), and some land acquisition.
The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority estimated the cost of the Murrumbateman bypass to be $47.0 million in February 2004, but the cost estimate will be refined as planning progresses.</DOC>

Programme Explanation/Summary
Estimated Total Funding
School
General Recurrent Grants (GRG)
GRG funding helps government and non-government schools with the recurrent costs of school education so they can offer students educational programmes directed towards the achievement of the Australian Government's priorities for schooling.
$27.4 billion over the 2005-2008 funding quadrennium
English as a Second Language  -  New Arrivals (ESL-NA)*
To assist with the provision of intensive English language tuition for eligible students

Youth Pathways
To assist the most at-risk young people (aged 13-19 years) to make a successful transition through school to completion of year 12 (or its equivalent) and ultimately, to further education, training or employment and active participation in the community.
In 2006, funding of some $24 million will assist at least 17,000 young people. The 2006-07 Budget will provide additional funding of around $46 million over four years, so that Youth Pathways will provide an estimated $37 million each calendar year to 2010 to assist at least 25,500 young people.
Partnership Outreach Education Model (POEM)
Targets young people who are disconnected from mainstream schooling, and possibly their families and communities, and provides an education and personal development programme delivered in supported community-based settings.

$56.1 million provided in the 2006-07 budget
Higher Education
Commonwealth Supported Places**
On average the Australian Government contributes around three-quarters of the tuition costs for eligible students to study in Australian Universities, while the student contributes the remainder.
$3.23 billion has been allocated in 2006 under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to higher education providers to support over 417,000 Commonwealth supported places
Higher Education Contribution Scheme  -  Higher Education Loan Programme (HECS-HELP)**
Eligible students can take out a HECS-HELP loan to cover their tuition costs. Repayments are not required until the students' income reaches a minimum repayment threshold ($38,149 in 2006-07). HECS-HELP ensures eligible students are not prevented from participating in higher education if they are unable to pay their tuition costs up-front.
$2.2 billion in HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP loans to eligible students in 2006, plus around $100 million in HECS-HELP discounts for up front payments.
Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarship**
Assists students from low socio-economic backgrounds with higher education costs. In 2006, the scholarship is worth $2,080 per annum (indexed annually). The scholarships are non-repayable and are not counted as income for Centrelink benefit purposes or as income for tax purposes for full-time students.
$198 million (legislated prices) is available over the period 2005-06 to 2009-10.
*A range of visa subclasses, including all school-aged humanitarian entrants, are eligible for funding under this programme.**Students from Africa who are holders of a permanent visa may be eligible.Government policies, and deliberation on those policies, are a matter for Government.</DOC>

Yes.Yes - Funding was provided in November 2003 to assist in upgrading facilities at the Bassatin abattoir and the Bassatin Abattoir Manager was brought to Australia late in 2004 to obtain first-hand experience of Australian livestock handling techniques and facilities. This was in addition to funding and technical assistance provided by industry via Meat and Livestock Australia.In response to information alleging animal abuse in Egyptian slaughterhouses, the Australian Government suspended live cattle exports to Egypt pending further investigation by Australia into the allegations.Australia's Consul-Agriculture (Middle East) visited Egypt in February 2006 to investigate the allegations first hand. This was followed by a visit from a high level delegation from Australia who also met with senior Egyptian officials in March 2006 to discuss animal welfare issues and to seek their assurances on the handling of Australian animals in Egypt. The trade will not be reopened until these assurances are obtained.The suspension will remain in place until an arrangement is agreed with Egyptian authorities and the Australian export industry that handling and slaughter practices of Australian cattle are sensitive to animal welfare.If, or when, an arrangement is agreed to enable the trade in Australian cattle to Egypt to recommence, the detail of that agreement will include a requirement to comply with the relevant guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health.Government policy supports both livestock exports and meat exports.</DOC>

Yes. AQIS has analysed the pest and disease risks associated with these vessels and uses this analysis to target the biosecurity risks they pose.Yes. Parrots, dogs, poultry and mosquitoes have been found on illegal foreign fishing vessels. There has been one recorded incident of a monkey arriving into an Australia port on an illegal foreign fishing vessel in 1998. All seized animals have been destroyed under quarantine control.In a general sense the larger illegal foreign fishing vessels, such as ice boats and trawlers present the greatest quarantine risk because they routinely carry considerable provisions for crew and have cold storage facilities that enable quarantine risk materials such as unprocessed meats and eggs to be carried. Live animals such as birds and dogs may also be present on the larger illegal foreign fishing vessels. The majority of illegal foreign fishing vessels originate in Indonesia where avian influenza, rabies and black striped mussel are known to be present, but foot and mouth disease is not present.
 
Avian influenza. Waste materials (eg poultry meat and/or eggs food scraps) could potentially be a source of introduction of avian influenza into Australia. However, for this risk to be realised the scraps would have to have come from poultry that were infected at the time, be unprocessed (the virus is inactivated by proper cooking of meat and eggs), and be consumed by susceptible birds while the virus is still active (virus survival in carcase material at ambient temperatures is only a few days).Foot and mouth disease. Ingestion of contaminated waste material by pigs is a well-recognised method by which foot and mouth disease has been introduced to new areas. Thus, waste materials such as food scraps from pig meat that is contaminated with foot and mouth disease virus (and landed in a remote area of Australia, particularly where feral pigs may be present) poses a risk introducing this disease into Australia. Although the majority of illegal foreign fishing vessels originate from Indonesia, which is free from foot and mouth disease, in 2006 Australian authorities have seized three vessels that originated from elsewhere in Asia, where foot and mouth disease is known to occur.Rabies. If an infected dog is landed in a remote area of Australia and allowed to interact with local dogs (eg. in a remote community), there is a high risk that rabies could be introduced into the local dog population (through biting) and subsequently for infection to be transmitted to humans.Black striped mussel. If a foreign fishing vessel that is infested with black striped mussel lands by beaching in a remote area of Australia, there is considerable potential for biofouling assemblages, that may include black striped mussel, to be dislodged from the vessel's hull and for the mussel to become established in that locality.
 
to (c) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service undertakes ongoing surveillance and monitoring in northern Australia for targeted pests and diseases including avian influenza, foot and mouth disease and rabies. To date, highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot and mouth disease and rabies have not been detected in Australia during this surveillance. (d) Marine pest inspections are managed by the respective State and Territory Governments.Yes. Australia's Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) includes detailed contingency plans for responding to a range of disease threats, including (a) foot and mouth disease in feral pigs, (b) rabies in wild animals (including dingos) and (c) avian influenza in birds. (d) Australia also has a national Emergency Marine Pest Plan (EMPPlan) that includes contingencies for incursion by marine pests, such as black striped mussel, in tidal creeks and rivers.For incursions by animal diseases, the response plan is implemented by agreement through a National Management Group (NMG) that comprises representation by the Chief Executive Officers of Commonwealth and State Departments of Agriculture/Primary Industries along with CEOs of relevant industry sectors. The cost of implementing each plan is shared by Commonwealth and State/Territory Governments and industry and varies on a case-by-case basis determined by the scale and extent of a disease outbreak and the relevant action plan agreed by the National Management Group. A national Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement (EADRA) was established in 2004 that formalises beneficiary cost-sharing arrangements for emergency animal diseases including foot and mouth disease, avian influenza and rabies.For marine pests, the national contingency plan is implemented through agreement by a National Management Group (NMG) that comprises representation for each jurisdiction by Natural Resource Management Standing Committee members. The cost of implementing national contingency arrangements for an incursion by black-striped mussel would vary on a case-by-case basis determined by the scale and extent of an incursion and the relevant action plan agreed by the NMG.The estimated cost would vary according to the scale and extent of an incursion.For avian influenza the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) is currently working on a study to estimate the costs of a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak. The report is expected to be completed by the end of June 2006. Australian animal health authorities have previously eradicated avian influenza on five separate occasions with costs ranging between $400 000 and $3 million.For foot and mouth disease, the Productivity Commission completed a report in 2002 that provides estimates for socio-economic costs associated with three disease scenarios; (i) a 3 month outbreak (ii) a 6 month outbreak and (iii) a 12 month outbreak.- For a 3 month outbreak a total reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) over 10 years is estimated between $2 000-3 000 million.- For a 6 month outbreak a total reduction in GDP (over 10 years) is estimated between $3 000-5 000 million.- For a 12 month outbreak a total reduction in GDP (over 10 years) is estimated between $8 000-13 000 million.For an incursion of rabies, formal cost estimates have not been established. Cost implications would be expected to lie primarily in the area of public health rather than GDP/trade.For black-striped mussel, formal cost estimates have not been established. The incursion in Darwin marinas in 1999 provides an indicative cost estimate of $2.2 million to achieve eradication in that situation.</DOC>

As at 23 May 2006, there were 1,053 operational Medicare Australia Access Points (previously known as Medicare Easyclaim sites).Refer to Attachment A for a list of Medicare Australia Access Points containing their address and the federal electoral division in which they are located. The list is sorted by state.Medicare Australia considers a number of factors when determining if a locality is eligible to have Medicare Australia Access Point installed.Medicare Australia assesses potential localities using the following criteria:the volume of claims lodged by customers from the potential catchment area;population and demographics;the availability of other Medicare Claiming channels;the level of bulk billing in the area;establishment and ongoing costs;health services in the area such as health centres, pharmacies and medical practices; andsuitable site to host the Medicare Australia Access Point.If an area is considered to have met the above criteria (1-6), a suitable site must then be selected. A Medicare Australia field officer usually visits the locality to investigate potential sites. The following criteria are then considered:convenient location (in close proximity to medical centres/ doctors surgeries; easily accessible by public transport users and adequate car parking);adequate space;adequate privacy;good site presentation;adequate access to building;disabled / wheelchair access;provision of aggregated services, particularly Government services; andbusiness opening hours.To prepare this answer, it has taken approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of $399.Medicare Australia Access Point list as at 2 June 2006

and (2) The United States Pacific Air Forces Bomber Training in Australia was first formally raised when the Defence Attaché at the United States Embassy wrote to the Chief of the Defence Force on 29 March 2004 requesting the program.Working-level exchanges between the Royal Australian Air Force and US Pacific Air Force personnel and officers of the International Policy Division took place prior to the AUSMIN 2005 talks, principally in the form of planning meetings in Canberra, Sydney and Darwin in the week 19-26 June 2004. In Canberra, discussions were led by Director of the International Policy Division's US Section, and included representatives from Air Force International Engagement and Strategic Operations Division. Officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Prime Minister and Cabinet also attended these discussions. The program was also further discussed by the then-Chief of Air Force Houston, and US Generals Jumper, Moseley and Hester, at the Pacific Air Chiefs' Conference in Guam on 21 - 22 September 2004.The Statement of Principles was signed for Australia by the former Deputy Secretary Strategy, Mr Carmody, on 9 June 2005, and by the former Chief Joint Operations Vice Admiral Shalders on 11 June 2005, and for the US by Pacific Command Director of Air and Space Operations, Major General Deptula on 19 July 2005.The text of the Statement of Principles is classified and, therefore, cannot be released.The Statement of Principles is not intended to be an agreement binding under international law. It is a written record of mutually determined policy and operational guidelines for the management and implementation of the training program.</DOC>

Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs issue a number of different types of concession cards, depending on the person's circumstances. The Australian Government's main purpose in issuing these cards is to provide access to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription items, and certain Medicare services, at a cheaper rate. These concessions are provided irrespective of a person's state of residence.Australian Government concession cards are also used by state, territory and local governments and some private providers, to target a range of other discounts on services that they provide, to selected groups of people. The concession providers themselves decide what concessions will be made available, and who can receive them.The Australian Government has provided funding to state and territory governments since 1993 to ensure that certain 'core' concessions are provided to all pensioners. The 'core' concessions to which this payment relates are those for energy, municipal and water rates, public transport and motor vehicle registration.Payments to state and territory governments are made through the Specific Purpose Payment (SPP) Compensation for the Extension of Fringe Benefits to Pensioners and Older Long-term Allowees and Beneficiaries.This payment was made as compensation to the states for the cost of the extension of the Pensioner Concession card to part rate pensioners. Before this payment was introduced the full cost of funding these concessions was borne by the states. The agreement for the payment ensures that States do not discriminate between PCC holders in terms of their eligibility for the core concessions defined above. The level of the concession is at the discretion of the provider.</DOC>

Pursuant to section 357(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (WR Act) it is a defence to the offence of lodging a workplace agreement or a variation to a workplace agreement that contains prohibited content, with the Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA), if the Employment Advocate (EA) has issued an advice that the agreement (or the agreement as varied) did not contain prohibited content.Prohibited content is set out in the Workplace Relations Regulations 1996 (Cth) (Regulations).Chapter 2, Part 8, Division 7.1, Regulation 8.5(1)(d) provides that a term of a workplace agreement is prohibited content 'to the extent it deals with employees bound by the agreement receiving leave to attend training (however described) provided by a trade union'.The EA has issued notices under section 357(2) to the effect that a term of workplace agreement is prohibited because it deals with employees receiving leave to attend training provided by a trade union.No, the EA did not 'object' to the Newlands Coal Pty Ltd Agreement because it contained 'a reference which allowed workers to attend union-backed safety courses'.The EA advised Newlands Coal Pty Ltd by letter dated 19 April 2006, that one of the clauses in their workplace agreement fell within the scope of Regulation 8.5(1)(d). The clause enabled union representatives to be provided with a leave of absence to attend to 'bona fide union business'.An employer contravenes the WR Act if the employer lodges a workplace agreement (or variation to a workplace agreement) with the EA that contains prohibited content and the employer is reckless as to whether the agreement contains prohibited content. A person contravenes the WR Act if the person seeks to include prohibited content in negotiations for a workplace agreement (or a variation to a workplace agreement) and the person is reckless as to whether the term contains prohibited content.If a body corporate contravenes these requirements, the maximum penalty they may receive is $33,000. If a person contravenes these requirements, the maximum penalty they may receive is $6,600.The WR Act does not preclude parties from including provisions in their workplace agreement that enable and/or encourage employees to attend occupational safety courses.The EA is not 'objecting' to agreements which include occupational health and safety clauses.</DOC>

The Commonwealth offered the parking infringement arrangements under the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations 1997 for the major regular public transport airports at the time of privatisation of the airports.
The other federal airports have the option of negotiating a local arrangement with their local council(s). These arrangements are a matter for those airports and the Department is not privy to the details.

The figure of US$125 million per aircraft appears to have been derived from the General Accounting Office (GAO) report 06-356 referring to aircraft bought by the US in 2012. This figure would be referred to as an Average Unit Procurement Cost (AUPC) and includes not only the cost of the aircraft, but a broad range of other 'system' elements, such as spares and support systems. It should be noted that this figure also comprises an average across all three Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) variants, that is, it includes the more expensive Short Take Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) and Carrier (CV) variants, whereas Australia is only looking to purchase the considerably less expensive Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) variant.Apart from the figure above being a composite figure of multiple variants, it is also for aircraft quite early in the production run. The A$100 million is an average unit cost across the entire Australian fleet inclusive of spares, facilities, weapons etc, but excluding contingency.There has been no proposed reduction in JSF numbers by any of the JSF partners. If there were a reduction in numbers by a JSF partner, the only case in which that could potentially have a significant impact on Australia is if the reduction were by the US. Even then, the reduction would be dependent on where the reduction was made: if the reduction was made at the end of the Program (that is, after Australia had bought its aircraft) it would have almost no impact on Australia. Further, any prospective reduction in aircraft numbers by any partner is likely to be offset, to at least some extent, by expected sales to third parties.Maximising affordability of the entire JSF Air System, not just the aircraft, throughout its entire life cycle is a pillar of the JSF Program. As a partner in the JSF Program, Australia has detailed insight into JSF costs and is working with all other partners to maximise affordability. This is just one of many issues under discussion during negotiations.The US$127 million or A$172 million quoted in the December 2005 Selected Acquisition Report is for the aircraft only. It does not include broader system costs and a range of necessary upgrades and associated acquisition costs. These costs are more than double the cost of the JSF.The JSF has the following additional advantages over the F-22:The JSF has true multi-role capabilities, the F-22 is optimised for air-to-air.Acquisition of the more modern JSF avoids obsolescence issues associated with the F-22.Partnership in the JSF Program has given Australia unique insights into aircraft capabilities.Partnership in the JSF has provided considerable opportunities for Australian industry.Partnership in the JSF provides Australia the opportunity to shape the global sustainment system for the aircraft and to be part of the follow-on development program.Partnership in the JSF has ensured waiver of non-recurring development costs and avoidance of Foreign Military Sales levies.Defence has been tasked to keep a watching brief on other fighter platforms, including the F-22. Given the F-22 does not meet Australia's full capability requirements and is at least twice as expensive as the JSF, further evaluation of the F-22 is not considered necessary.</DOC>

In the 2004 Budget, the Australian Government announced an increase in the national aged care planning benchmark from 100 to 108 aged care places for every 1,000 persons of the population aged 70 and over. These 108 places comprise 88 residential aged care places and 20 community care places.As at 31 December 2005, the operational residential aged care ratio in the Metropolitan West (South Australia) aged care planning region was 83.6 places for every 1,000 persons of the population aged 70 and over and the allocated ratio was 87.2.For the Metropolitan South (South Australia) aged care planning region the operational ratio was 83.9 places for every 1,000 persons of the population aged 70 and over and the allocated ratio was 92.0.Once all the allocated, but not yet operational residential places become operational, many more aged care places will be available in both aged care planning regions.To assist in reaching and maintaining the national benchmark operational ratio, up to 210 additional residential aged care places are available for allocation in the Metropolitan West, Metropolitan South and Metropolitan North (South Australia) aged care planning regions in the 2006 Aged Care Approvals Round.Additional residential places have been allocated to the Metropolitan West and Metropolitan South (South Australia) aged care planning regions in recent years and more places are available in the 2006 Aged Care Approvals Round. The Department of Health and Ageing monitors providers to ensure they bring allocated aged care places 'on line' as soon as practical, in accordance with the Aged Care Act 1997.and (b) The aged care operational ratios (per 1,000 persons aged 70 years or over), as at 30 June each year, from 1998 for the Metropolitan West and Metropolitan South (South Australia) aged care planning regions is contained in the following table.

Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution permits the Parliament of the Commonwealth to make laws relating to dental benefits. It does not impose any responsibility on the Government in relation to dental services.
As state and territory governments are solely responsible for public dental services, the Commonwealth Government has no plans to assume extra responsibility in this area.

Yes.Yes.and (d) Beyond the reports on Ms Tolouee's detention I have not seen evidence that the sexual assault of female dissidents by Iran's intelligence agency is commonplace or that sexual assault is a tactic employed by the Iranian regime. I would be deeply concerned should such evidence emerge.The Government notes reports of sexual assault perpetrated against female dissidents in Egypt. The Government strongly condemns the use of sexual violence and torture. Australia supports the promotion and protection of internationally recognised standards of human rights including international efforts to eliminate violence against women.to (c) Australia has urged the Iranian Government to stop the violation of rights of detainees in Iran. Our concerns over the human rights situation in Iran, including the treatment of detainees, were highlighted by our co-sponsoring a United Nations General Assembly Resolution in December 2005. The resolution called upon the Iranian Government to eliminate, in law and practice, the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.and (ii) The Iranian Government has not taken any action sufficient to alleviate our concerns over these human rights issues.Australia and Iran held the first round of a human rights dialogue in December 2002.It was agreed at the first round of human rights dialogue with Iran (December 2002) to hold a second round in Canberra at a time to be determined. A second round has not yet been scheduled.At the first round of the dialogue, the Australian delegation was led by then First Assistant Secretary of the International Organisations and Legal Division, Caroline Millar, and included Justice Catherine Branson of the Federal Court of Australia, Australia's Ambassador to Iran, Jeremy Newman, and officials from the Attorney-General's Department, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Iranian delegation was led by Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Director General for International Legal Affairs, Danesh Yazdi, and included officials from the MFA, the Justice Department, the judiciary, and the Islamic Human Rights Commission as well as academics.The first round of the dialogue involved an exchange of views covering a broad range of themes: international human rights issues; our respective constitutional, judicial and legal systems; the position of minorities (including Baha'is and Jews); the position of women; freedom of expression and the role of national human rights institutions; and the death penalty. The Australian delegation also had separate meetings with senior figures from the Iranian judiciary, the clergy, women parliamentarians and prison officials. Following the first round of dialogue, a delegation from the Islamic Human Rights Commission of Iran visited Australia in 2003 to study the roles and functioning of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.Australia remains seriously concerned by the human rights situation in Iran. Since the election of President Ahmadinejad, Iran's human rights record has deteriorated. Issues of the execution of minors, freedom of expression, lack of legal due process and systematic discrimination against women, girls and religious and ethnic groups are of particular concern. Iran has shown no sign of taking international concerns into account on human rights. Iran's disregard for international opinion was evident in President Ahmadinejad's comments last year calling for Israel to be 'wiped off the map'.As per (4) (b) and (c).</DOC>

Yes. (i) The Government takes an ongoing interest in the human rights situation in Egypt, especially in light of reported crackdowns on pro-democracy reformers and urges an increased commitment to the promotion and protection of internationally recognised standards of human rights. (ii) Our Ambassador in Cairo has outlined Australia's support for Egypt's political reform with local media and government officials. Australia also made joint representations with the US, UK, Canada and the Republic of Ireland in 2004 to promote the rights of Egyptian religious minorities, specifically the Baha'is.</DOC>

The Australian Government has undertaken extensive consultations with industry, state and territory government departments and other stakeholders regarding the impact of illegal logging on imports of forest products into Australia. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has also commissioned a review of the volume, value and origin of illegal and suspected illegal forest products imported into Australia and a report ascertaining the policies and mechanisms utilised by Australian timber importers to determine the legality and sustainability of timber imports. Senator Abetz, Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, recently announced that a draft policy paper is to be completed by the end of August 2006 for consultation with stakeholders.The Australian Government is currently undertaking forestry programmes within Asia-Pacific nations, such as the Forestry Management Project in the Solomon Islands and the Support to the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Forestry Authority under the Advisory Support Facility in PNG, to improve the governance and law enforcement of the forestry sector in these nations. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is the agency responsible for developing and undertaking assistance programmes for developing countries.</DOC>

The Australian Government responded fully to the final report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation (CAR) in September 2002. The Government's response, which indicated which recommendations were adopted, is available at my website (www.atsia.gov.au) under 'Responses and Reports'. Although a National Reconciliation Convention was not recommended by CAR, the Government has funded Reconciliation Australia to hold a convention in the form of a leaders' forum and other national events in 2007.
 investment in community leadership initiatives; reviewing and re-engineering government programmes and services to ensure they deliver practical support to Indigenous Australians; and the forging of closer links between the business sector and Indigenous communities to help promote economic independence.
Performance monitoring of these priorities is now undertaken via the two-yearly
Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage
 (OID) report, a comprehensive suite of statistical indicators on key areas including life expectancy, education outcomes, labour force participation and hospitalisation. Also, since
2004, States, Territories and the Commonwealth have reported to COAG annually on progress against the Framework for Reconciliation that COAG adopted in 2000. Further, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is able to report on reconciliation and has done so publicly within its legislative powers since 1999. Currently, Reconciliation Australia which the Government has funded since its inception in 2001, is examining the option of creating a 'reconciliation barometer' that would provide a regular assessment of the attitudes of the Australian community to the reconciliation process. The Government considers these reporting mechanisms to be adequate and no additional layer of reporting (including from a Joint Parliamentary Committee) is required. Also, the Government does not consider it necessary to change the Constitution to progress its reconciliation agenda.
Responsibility for Indigenous intellectual property issues lies with the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. There has been no communication between me or my Department and the Attorney-General or his Department about the Government's consideration of a resale royalty rights scheme.
Australian Government funding, specifically for other aspects of reconciliation, has been allocated to the development of Reconciliation Place in Canberra and for grants to Reconciliation Australia which is charged with promoting reconciliation at local and community levels.
A number of clearing houses for research, data and publications on Indigenous issues already exist and are supported by Government funding. They include the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University.

As at 30 June 2006, forty-four Australian civilian officials were working in Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government agencies under the Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP) as advisers in the areas of economic and financial management, public sector reform, law and justice, border management and transport security.
The Government has been discussing with PNG authorities options for a revised policing component of the ECP that would be consistent with a ruling of the PNG Supreme Court on the PNG legislation to implement the ECP Treaty. The Government has offered to provide a number of Australian police as advisers to assist in key roles related to police reform, organised crime, terrorism and corruption. Discussions are also continuing on further assistance in the law and justice sector, including a proposal to fill the position of PNG Solicitor-General with an ECP deployee.
At the 2005 Australia-PNG Ministerial Forum, Ministers from both sides agreed that ECP deployees were making a valuable contribution to a range of priority areas in PNG and were helping to build the capacities of PNG government systems, strengthen governance and reduce corruption.</DOC>

The Australian Taxation Office engaged the Leader Factor to conduct a qualitative multi source feedback process at a cost of $18,480.The qualitative multi source feedback process is commonly used across the Public Service and is the process used to gather leadership behavioural feedback on managers in the Australian Taxation Office. This is mandatory for managers at the Executive Level 2 or higher classification levels.The process involves receiving feedback about an individual's leadership performance from that individual's manager, direct reports and colleagues. This particular process involved the feedback being gathered through interview. It also involves having the individual complete a self assessment on their own performance.The feedback questions are structured around the Australian Public Service Commission Integrated Leadership competencies, namely Shapes Strategic Thinking; Achieves Results; Cultivates Productive Relationships; Communicates with Influence and Exemplifies Personal Drive and Integrity.The Commissioner advised that he considers this investment provides strong value to the individual and himself in terms of both performance and development and is a significant input into decisions on succession and placement of senior staff.</DOC>

No.The Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) as amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Work Choices Act) maintains the existing right of employers and employees to choose whether or not they wish to make an agreement, and if so, the type of agreement that suits them best. The Act does not, and should not, force either party to enter an agreement against their wishes and/or best interests. Therefore, the existing legislation protects employers and employees against action taken with the intent to coerce them to (for example) agree, or not agree to make a collective agreement. It also prohibits the application of duress to an existing employee or employer in connection with an AWA. These protections are maintained under the Work Choices Act.If an employer party to a proposed collective agreement refuses to negotiate, then their employees may, subject to the Act's procedural requirements, take protected industrial action in support of their claims. Also, the Work Choices Act requires employers to genuinely try to reach agreement with either the relevant trade union/s or employees before they can take protected industrial action.</DOC>

The Murray-Darling Basin Commission provided a report to the May 2006 meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council on the use of environmental water in the River Murray.
Since November 2003, existing water available to the environment has been actively managed by jurisdictions and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. This work has contributed towards meeting the ecological objectives for the Living Murray six Icon Sites. In this context, 2005-06 represents the most active season of environmental management in the history of river regulation.
Over 36,000 hectares of the natural environment of the River Murray system and Icon Sites has been deliberately watered for environmental purposes, using approximately 915 gigalitres of water. The sources of water used included a combination of the accumulated Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation, other existing state-based environmental allocations (e.g. Victorian Murray Flora and Fauna Entitlement, NSW Adaptive Environmental Water), River Murray surplus flows, above entitlement flows to South Australia, and water recovered from the Joint Government Enterprise.
More specifically, about 510 gigalitres from the Barmah-Millewa Forest Environmental Water Allocation was released to achieve one of the most significant colonial nesting waterbird breeding events in recent decades and the spawning of threatened fish such as Silver Perch. Environmental water was also delivered through various means such as flow enhancement, pumping/siphoning, weir manipulation, and use of regulated creeks/channels to reinvigorate stressed floodplain vegetation including River Red Gums, and to fill wetlands across Gunbower Forest, Hattah Lakes, Chowilla Floodplain and the River Murray Channel Icon Sites. Water was also released through the Barrages at the Murray Mouth to provide temporary freshening of parts of the Coorong and fishways along the River Murray Channel were operated continuously for nine months.
Due to dry conditions, environmental watering opportunities in 2004-05 were limited, but included combining surplus flows with water from the NSW and Victorian environmental water accounts to water Barmah-Millewa and Gunbower Forests, Hattah Lakes and Chowilla Floodplain. In addition, there was sufficient flow into the Lower Lakes to release about 40 gigalitres through the Barrages and into the Coorong and through the Murray Mouth.
In May 2006, the Australian Government announced a cash injection of $500 million to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The funds will accelerate all previous Murray - Darling Basin Ministerial Council and Commission decisions including providing additional resources to invest in water recovery measures under the Living Murray Initiative and to make best use of the recovered water.
Under the Initiative, four initial water recovery proposals were approved by the Murray - Darling Basin Ministerial Council in November 2004. Of these, the Australian Government announced in early 2006 investment of $37.2 million in the Victorian Goulburn Murray project to recover 145 gigalitres of environmental water, which is expected to be available in July 2007. The Australian Government is expecting to invest in the other three proposals in 2006-07 to recover a further 90 gigalitres, including 44 gigalitres from the Darling Anabranch pipeline project and 25 gigalitres from the decommissioning of Lake Mokoan.
At the most recent Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting, South Australia announced a package of measures under the Living Murray Initiative to recover 35 gigalitres, including 13 gigalitres which is expected to be available for environmental use in the first half of 2007. At the same time, NSW presented a strategy to recover an estimated 71.5 gigalitres.
Additional water for the Living Murray Initiative will be recovered in future years with an average of up to 500 gigalitres per year ultimately available for River Murray increased flows.
To speed up the recovery of water under the Living Murray Initiative, the Australian Government recently announced a Water Through Efficiency Tender to encourage the adoption of on-farm and off-farm water efficiency measures as a means of obtaining permanent water entitlements. To ensure productive capacity is maintained, the tender will only acquire eligible water entitlements from holders who can propose offsetting water efficiency measures.
Under the Joint Government Enterprise, 38 gigalitres of environmental water has so far been recovered for the River Murray. Additional water will be recovered in future years with an average of up to 70 gigalitres per year ultimately available for River Murray increased flows.

Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) receive regular across-the-board pay increases under the ADF Workplace Remuneration Arrangement (WRA) and the Star Ranks Remuneration Arrangement (SRRA). The current arrangements have delivered a cumulative pay increase of ten per cent to ADF members over the life of the arrangement (6 May 2004 to 3 November 2006). This equates to four per cent per year. Over the past five years (March 2001 to March 2006) the ADF has received cumulative pay rises of 21.5 per cent through the WRA, a little over four per cent per year.A comparison of movements in ADF salaries with the Average Annualised Wage Increase (per employee) produced by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations shows that movements in ADF salaries under the WRA have been in line with those in the public and private sectors over the same period.</DOC>

For the 2004-05 income year, approximately 100,000 businesses claimed the immediate write-off of depreciating assets less than $1,000 each, provided for under the Simplified Tax System.For the 2004-05 income year, approximately 275,000 businesses with a turnover less than $50,000 were registered for GST purposes and paid GST.Of these 275,000 businesses, approximately 255,000 businesses chose to register for GST purposes. Please note that this is an estimation made by excluding businesses who are required to register irrespective of turnover (that is, taxi drivers and agents for non-residents).Note: all data is as at 5 June 2006.</DOC>

and (b) At the end of June 2005, there were approximately 885,000 small business collectable debt cases (debt not subject to dispute or associated with insolvency) to the value of $7.68 billion.At the end of June 2006, there were approximately 914,000 small business collectable debt cases to the value of $8.11 billion.At the end of June 2006, 92 per cent of small business debtors comprised debts of $25,000 or less.128,000 taxpayers who were in scope for the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative have cleared their pre 30 June 2004 debt(s).At the end of June 2006, there were around 80,000 small business collectable debt cases in a current repayment plan with the ATO.The ATO commenced legal action against 36,462 small businesses during the 2004-05 financial year. (This figure includes garnishee notices, statutory demands, director penalty notices and ATO actions subject to Court processes.)and (b) Generally, prosecution action is only initiated against taxpayers who do not lodge outstanding statements or returns or those who fail to comply with a notice issued under either section 260-5 or 353-10 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA 1953).A notice pursuant to section 260-5 empowers the Commissioner to collect tax debts from third parties who owe, hold money for or who may hold money for, an ATO debtor.A section 353-10 notice requires a person to supply the ATO with information or to attend or give evidence with regard to collection matters.During the 2004-05 financial year, 166 small businesses became bankrupt following ATO initiated proceedings.With regard to the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative, the overall default rate for promises to pay was less than that of the general debtor population. The administrative certainty of payment by way of direct debit appears to have been an effective collection tool evidenced by the ongoing payment of arrears.The ATO wants to see viable businesses continue to trade. Businesses are encouraged to approach the ATO where they face difficulties in making payments. Correspondence and phone contact are made before firmer action strategies are applied. Legal action is generally only taken after appropriate warnings are given and, where necessary, the ATO will take action leading to bankruptcy or company wind-up where debts are not addressed.Since the release of the Inspector General's Review of ATO Small Business Debt Collection Practices, extensive work has commenced on differentiated debt and debt analytics. The early results of this work are now being used to inform debt collection practice.Yes, where small businesses are not willing to pay their taxes the ATO will take firmer action. This includes the use of garnishee powers.Between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2006, 6,598 garnishee notices have issued to third parties who owe, or who may hold money for small businesses.Garnishee action is generally only taken after appropriate warnings are given.The ATO does not collect this information.The ATO continually examines its approaches to administering the tax system.To initiate bankruptcy or wind-up proceedings, the minimum amount of debt owed to a creditor must be $2000. This is a requirement of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (for individuals) and the Corporations Act 2001 (for companies).</DOC>

The report is an internal working document and as such is unlikely to be released.I have held initial discussions with the pharmaceutical sector, including the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to assess the potential impact of some possible changes to the PBS. These discussions are at a preliminary stage.PBS affordability is a matter of ongoing consideration by the Government with ideas developed and explored within Government on a routine and ongoing basis.and (b) The Pharmaceutical Industry Working Group, jointly chaired by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane and myself, has provided an opportunity for ongoing dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry around PBS issues. As outlined in my response to question 2, I have commenced preliminary discussions with the pharmaceutical sector on some possible changes to the PBS.</DOC>

I have been provided with a copy of the article.to (4) There is no single authoritative or complete data source on terminations of pregnancies in Australia. This means that it is not possible to give a precise number of terminations each year.It is possible however to combine data from a number of sources to provide an estimate of the number of terminations each year.The annual average number of terminations over the 10 years to 2004-05, including those as a result of medical procedures financially assisted under Medicare and privately funded, is estimated to be 87,000 per annum. The data sources are hospital data supplied by states and territories under the reporting requirements of the Australian Health Care Agreements and Medicare Benefits Schedule data.Detailed information on the sources of this data follows.National Morbidity Casemix Data Set (NMDS)The Australian Government receives unit record data from the states and territories on public and private hospital utilisation including information about admitted patient procedures. This data is provided under the Australian Health Care Agreements and forms the NMDS. This data includes information against a number of codes which together indicate the number of terminations occurring in public and private hospitals. These codes comprise: medical abortion; unspecified abortion; failed attempted abortion; other abortion1.The quality of the source data reported through the NMDS is a matter for states and territories. My department has written to each state and territory jurisdiction to seek their comments on the NMDS data held against the codes specified above.By writing to individual jurisdictions, the department has made every endeavor to verify the accuracy of the data with the states and territories. However, it is not able to independently verify it. Ultimately, the accuracy of the data relies on coding standards and issues of completeness which cannot be ascertained by my department.Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)MBS claims data provides a further source of information on terminations each year, as it identifies procedures which occurred outside hospital for which a Medicare claim was made. Two MBS items are of relevance:MBS item 35643 (6469)  -  evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage. This item covers terminations but will also apply to those situations where there is a missed abortion (the foetus has died but not been expelled) and trophoblastic disease which is an abnormality of the placenta and in some cases is cancerous. This MBS item should not include those situations where the woman has had a miscarriage or where the woman is not pregnant such as scraping the lining of the womb to try to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding.MBS item 16525  -  management of second trimester labour, with or without induction, for intrauterine foetal death, gross foetal abnormality or life threatening maternal disease.MBS data includes cases of foetal death, miscarriage and trophoblastic disease and may therefore overstate the numbers of medical terminations.There are no plans to amend the relevant Medicare item numbers.The policy objective of the Pregnancy Support Counselling measures is to improve support services for pregnant women.While there are already a range of pregnancy counselling services available to women and their partners, women may be unaware of available services or may find it difficult to access them, particularly in rural areas and after hours.It is important that women are able to access non-directive counselling when they are uncertain about a pregnancy and that they are able to do so quickly. By providing an MBS item for this purpose, a broad network of service providers becomes available, increasing the likelihood that women will be able to get the support they need.The Helpline will assist women in areas where access to appropriate general practitioner and allied health professional services may be limited. It will also benefit those who need assistance after hours, providing a quality service option for those who prefer to remain anonymous or to receive counselling and advice in a non-clinical setting. Partners, who will not be eligible for the MBS item, will also be able to receive advice from the Helpline.The Helpline will provide a service which is professional and non-directive, and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.1 Terms are defined as follows: 'medical abortion'  -  medically induced abortions; 'unspecified abortion'  -  documentation not available; 'failed attempted abortion'  -  either medically induced or other abortion which is incomplete or unsuccessful; 'other abortion'  -  any specified abortion other than an abortion that could be coded elsewhere. In 2003-04, of the terminations of pregnancy across Australia recorded in the NMDS, 98.2% were for 'medical abortion', 1.5% were for 'unspecified abortion', 0.1% were for 'failed attempted abortion', and 0.2% were for 'other abortion'.</DOC>

For the purposes of section 87 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Telecommunications Act) phone card providers are considered as carriage service providers and as such must comply with service provider rules set out in the Telecommunications Act and instruments made under it. As an eligible carriage service provider for the purposes of section 127 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, a phone card provider must also join the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) scheme. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has the power to direct phone card providers to comply with an industry code that has been registered under section 117 of the Telecommunications Act and applies to these providers.Phone card service providers are also subject to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state and territory fair trading legislation.The TIO's annual report for 2004-05 indicates that the TIO received 463 complaints about phone cards, including international phone cards, during this financial year.The report also stated that the TIO had completed systemic investigations into three phone card companies in April 2005. Following the investigation, one of these companies was formally referred to the then Australian Communications Authority (ACA) for possible breaches of the Billing Code, developed by the industry under the auspices of the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF).The TIO stated that two other companies were informally referred to the ACA for possible breaches of registered codes, including the Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code and the Complaint Handling code.ACMA has advised that it contacted all state based consumer affairs and fair trading agencies towards the end of 2005 to gauge the extent of complaints against phone card companies. ACMA advised that all agencies reported very low levels of complaint about calling cards, with up to two inquiries per quarter.Retailers of phone cards are considered to be carriage service providers or their agents. Phone card service providers must therefore ensure that they or their agents provide information at the point of sale consistent with the requirements of the Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code.The Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code specifies the minimum requirements for carriage service providers to meet when informing customers about the prices, terms and conditions of their products. The code rules apply to information given by providers in advertisements, at the point of sale, in any contract the customer enters into, and on an ongoing basis while the customer uses the products. The code also requires that information be provided to customers in a form that is readily accessible, legible and capable of being understood.Retailers of mobile phone cards are also subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state or territory fair trading legislation.Consumers may complain to various agencies, depending on the nature of the complaint.As stated above, phone card service providers must be members of the TIO Scheme and are bound by the TIO's determinations. The TIO is an 'office of last resort' in that consumers must have sought unsuccessfully to resolve their complaint directly with the provider before the TIO will investigate. Complaints can be lodged with the TIO by phone, fax, email or post. The freecall number is 1800 062 058 and freefax number is 1800 630 614.Where a consumer considers that the phone card service provider has breached the telecommunications legislation, a complaint could be lodged with the communications regulator, ACMA. Such a complaint could be lodged by phone, fax, email or post. ACMA's phone number is (03) 9963 6800.Consumers may contact the ACCC to inquire about the application of the Trade Practices Act by telephoning 1300 302 502.Alternatively, consumers may lodge a complaint with the fair trading agency in the relevant state or territory.</DOC>

The ATO has implemented a number of debt collection strategies over recent years including the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative.Outsourcing some debt collection activities has extended the ATO's capacity to contact more taxpayers with an outstanding tax debt.The pilot was conducted from 7 April 2006 until 30 June 2006.The pilot project to refer debt collection activity to an external service provider is being used in addition to current ATO debt collection practices. It is one of a number of new strategies to collect outstanding tax debt and is an attempt to engage with taxpayers who have long outstanding obligations.The pilot will test the effectiveness of using a respected, highly professional and experienced external mercantile agency to extend the debt collection activity of the ATO.No.and (b) No.This will be part of the ATO's evaluation of the pilot.</DOC>

Most CDEP organisations will continue to receive wages in advance on a quarterly basis. However, there may be situations where organisations do not manage their funds appropriately, in which case those organisations may receive funding monthly rather than quarterly. The decision about the frequency of fund releases is made on an individual basis depending on the circumstances.CDEP organisations should take account of funds likely to be available before purchasing training and should ensure that participants complete training wherever possible. Organisations should also consider working with Job Network members who may be able to assist in the cost of training for participants who are registered with the Job Network.The change to supervisor fees that comes into effect from 1 July 2006 will have no effect on training programs, workers compensation and insurance costs which are paid from Activity Fees. The estimated amounts for these expenses have been included by the CDEP organisation in the funding submission.During the negotiation process DEWR and the CDEP organisation will agree on the number of supervisors required by a CDEP organisation and the Activity Fee amount will be changed to reflect the agreed amount for supervisor wages. As with other employers, CDEP organisations have the discretion to employ people full time or part time in supervisory positions.Indigenous communities have called for CDEP to be utilised as a stepping stone rather than a destination. In urban and regional areas in particular there are many job opportunities and support services to assist CDEP participants in the transition to employment off CDEP. For this reason time limits for new participants have been introduced in urban and regional areas. CDEP participants who are subject to time limits will also be required to register with a Job Network member who can provide participants with job search support and other services while they gain valuable work experience and skills through CDEP.The most recent reliable data on Indigenous unemployment by region is the 2001 Census. The 2001 Census reported that the Indigenous unemployment rate was (a) 20.1 per cent in major cities, (b) 24 per cent in regional areas and (c) 11.9 per cent in remote locations.In the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey released in April 2006, the ABS estimated an Indigenous unemployment rate in 2004-05 at 15.4 per cent, compared with 22.9 per cent in the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, which was the most recent comparable survey.I can not comment as CDEP participants may be either counted as unemployed or employed depending on how the person self-identifies.I have publicly stated that I am committed to the future of CDEP with an emphasis on obtaining employment for Indigenous Australians. For Indigenous Australians to obtain mainstream employment, participation in the CDEP programme is not the only option. CDEP is part of a range of programmes to assist unemployed people. Organisations with expertise in assisting Indigenous job seekers also have the option of tendering to provide other employment or employment related services.Information about post labour market assistance outcomes achieved for employment services managed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) are published quarterly in the Labour Market Assistance Outcomes (LMAO) reports. These reports are available on the Australian Workplace website using the following link: http://www.workplace.gov.au/workplace/ Category/Publications/ProgrammeEvaluation/LabourMarketAssistanceOutcomes.htmThe Labour Market Assistance Outcomes reports are based on the Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) surveys conducted by DEWR. The PPM surveys measure job seekers' outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients rather than the full population.Outcomes estimates for Indigenous clients who participated in various forms of employment assistance delivered through Job Network are shown in Tables 1 to 5. The results relate to clients whose outcomes were measured in the year ending December each year unless otherwise specified. Tables 1-5 include (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time and (ii) part-time employment three months after exiting placements.The delivery of Job Network services under Employment Services Contract two ceased on 30 June 2003. From 1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the Active Participation Model (APM). Data are not available for calendar year 2003 because of the introduction of new programmes associated with the APM.Results for the employment services provided under the APM have progressively become available. Reliable outcomes estimates cannot be produced until a sufficient number of clients have received assistance and subsequently been surveyed. Results for Intensive Support job search training have been published since the June 2004 edition of the Labour Market Assistance Outcomes. Intensive Support customised assistance outcome results have been published since September 2004, and outcomes for the Intensive Support stream of assistance since December 2004.Outcomes results for 2006 are scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2007.Table 1: Intensive Assistance (ESC2) Post-Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Indigenous Job SeekersPeriodTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)200027.1nana200127.313.513.8200232.817.015.8Table 2.: Job Search Training (ESC2) Post-Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Indigenous Job SeekersPeriodTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)200029.216.612.6200125.814.511.3200229.515.514.0Table 3.: Intensive Support customised assistance (ESC3) Post Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Indigenous Job SeekersPeriodTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)200432.515.217.3Year ending September 200533.616.017.7Table 4.: Intensive Support job search training (ESC3) Post-Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Indigenous Job SeekersPeriodTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)200447.924.723.2Year ending September 200549.630.619.0Table 5.: Intensive Support (ESC3) Post Programme Monitoring Outcomes For Indigenous Job SeekersPeriodTotal Employment (%)Full-time Employment (%)Part-time Employment (%)200432.014.117.9Year ending September 200533.516.217.3</DOC>

The Australian Government spent the following on foreign aid, referred to as Official Development Assistance (ODA):2002-2003, $A 1830.8 million2003-2004, $A 1973.1 million2004-2005, $A 2198.1 millionGovernance represents one of the key sectors for how Australia's aid program is delivered and reported upon, and expenditure on law and order is within the governance sector.For the purposes of this response, law and order has been calculated to include expenditure on all activities in the Legal and Judicial Development category and the Narcotics Control category; and relevant activities under the following categories; Government Administration, Economic and Development Planning, Post Conflict Peace Building, Human Rights, Business Services, and Trade Policy and Administrative Management. For example, law and order activities across a number of these categories would be part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and the Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP) with PNG.Following is a breakdown of Australia's ODA expenditure on governance per country for the financial years 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. Included within this breakdown is the estimated sub-total of the governance sector that represents expenditure on law and order.

No. In response to the department's inquiry, the hospital has advised that Mr Gribble was treated as an emergency patient as soon as he arrived by ambulance at 3.35am local time on 4 February.No. The department's Consular Emergency Centre (CEC) in Canberra has no record of a call being transferred from China to the CEC seeking assistance for Mr Gribble.Immediately following advice from Mr Gribble's family that he had been admitted to a hospital in Fuzhou, the CEC tasked our Consulate General in Guangzhou to assist him. Less than an hour later, however, the CEC was advised by the family that he had died.Yes (also see response to 3).The hospital in Fuzhou has advised that Mr Gribble was not refused medical treatment. Notwithstanding this, the department provides travel advice to Australians on health and local conditions overseas. Our advisory for China notes that 'the standard of medical care_in China is often limited and that hospitals and doctors often require cash payment, prior to providing medical services, including for emergency care'.</DOC>

 the 2005/06 amount is the full year forecast as at 30 April 2006Airservices Australia is not a Commonwealth budget funded agency. All revenue, with the exception of the $7 million per annum provided in the financial years 2001-02 to 2004-05 for the Location Specific Pricing Subsidy, comes from the aviation industry at prices reviewed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.The Airservices Australia Board approved consolidation of the Noise Enquiry Service on Friday 26 November 2004.I am advised that consolidation of the Noise Enquiry units to a central location has allowed improved services to be provided by the use of dedicated staff, specifically trained and solely committed to the noise enquiry function. This has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the services to the major airports and their community stakeholders, while also providing a cost saving to the aviation industry.I am advised that Airservices Australia met with the affected airport operators and the airports discussing the proposal with their respective noise abatement committees. Airservices Australia representatives attended the airport noise abatement committee meetings. Additionally, where requested, Airservices Australia provided presentations to local noise abatement committees about the proposal. Most of the consultative meetings were held in February and March 2005.</DOC>

The Australian Electoral Commission has provided the following information in response to the question.
attendance at community meetings within these divisions by Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staffspecific posters in appropriate languages at polling places addressing the formality requirementsthe production and distribution of reminder sheets to Issuing Officers in all polling places in these divisions, andthe production, distribution and display of videos in the applicable languages for electors in identified polling places.
The costs do not include the selection of polling place staff with appropriate language skills, as this was not considered to be an additional resource.
there were 13 polling places in the Division of Reid showing videos, 11 polling places with an Arabic/English video and 2 polling places with a Cantonese/English video;there were 10 polling places in the Division of Blaxland showing videos, 10 polling places with an Arabic/English video of which 2 polling places also showed a Vietnamese/English video; andthere were 29 polling places in the Division of Fowler showing videos, 21 polling places with a Vietnamese/English video, 7 polling places with an Arabic/English video and 1 polling place with a Spanish/English video., (b) and (c).
Community Meetings
As part of the AEC's Communication Strategy for electors from a non-English speaking background for the 2004 federal election, the AEC conducted community meetings with representatives from local ethnic communities at Migrant Resource Centres in southwestern Sydney. Community meetings were held at Auburn, Blacktown, Cabramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown and Parramatta.
Issuing Officer Reminder Sheets
Issuing Officer Reminder Sheets were developed for New South Wales and Queensland in relation to concerns that the use of optional preferential voting in recent state and local government elections in those states, as well as the option for voting 'above the line' on the Senate ballot paper, would impact adversely on formality. They were printed in seven languages  -  Greek, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese, Farsi and Chinese as well as English. Issuing Officers in polling places in the three divisions used the sheets to reinforce the message on how to vote formal.
Formality Posters
the Division of Reid had formality posters (A3 and A4 colour) in Greek, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese, Farsi and Chinese displayed in all polling places;the Division of Blaxland identified ten polling places and displayed A3 size formality posters in English, Arabic and Vietnamese and a sample of other languages in these polling places; andthe Division of Fowler had full sets of formality posters (A3 and A4 colour) for both the House of Representatives and Senate displayed in all polling places. These posters were displayed around the polling place, with some polling places displaying full sets of the posters outside the polling place so electors could refer to them whilst queuing.
'Number Every Box' Poster
As part of a national initiative, an A3 Number Every Box (House of Representatives) Poster (in English) was developed and distributed to all states. Every electoral division was supplied with enough posters for 2 posters to be displayed in every pre-poll voting centre and polling place. All polling places in the Divisions of Reid, Blaxland and Fowler displayed these posters.
Polling Place Staffing
All polling places were provided with Enquiry Officers. Some polling places were provided with additional staff employed as interpreters. People employed in the Enquiry Officer positions were specifically chosen for their ability to offer a second language. Each Enquiry Officer was provided with a non-laminated set of the multilingual formality posters.</DOC>

All education authorities have had significant notice of the Australian Government's intention to require them to implement plain English student reports in 2006.The Australian Government appreciates the efforts of education authorities and schools, and will closely monitor implementation of plain English student reports by all education authorities.The Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) consulted government and non-government education authorities and key national stakeholders, including parents and principals organisations, on arrangements for the new funding quadrennium and the Regulations to the Schools Assistance (Learning Together  -  Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 ('the Act') throughout 2004 and 2005.Research commissioned by the Australian Government, as well as the Minister's consultations with parents, teachers and community members, have shown that parents want to receive report cards written in plain language that show their child's achievement relative to objective standards and relative to the achievement of other students in the class.A-E grades (or equivalent) must be defined against specific learning standards. Determination of these standards is a matter for schools and education authorities.Parents need to know whether their child has achieved well above, above, at, below, or well below the standard expected for their year. An A-E (or equivalent) grading system provides parents with this information for all areas of learning. It is a system that most parents understand and readily identify with, so that they can determine where they need to support their child's learning and development.DEST has not issued advice that it would be unlikely that eighty percent of students would score higher than a C grade.Provision of A-E grades (or equivalent) is a useful way for parents to identify there may be a problem, however parents have a choice and may wish to withdraw their child from comparative reporting or assessment conditions.Tying the requirement to provide parents with plain English student reports to funding for schools is a mechanism for the Australian Government to enhance the accountability of schools and education authorities and demonstrate its commitment to supporting parents in their vital role as partners with schools in their children's education.It is intended that the new reporting requirements suit the needs of individual school communities and their children and allow schools and systems to build on their existing reporting practices. The principles for student reports set out in the Act include that they deal with both a child's academic and non-academic learning.</DOC>

During the lead up to the first Timorese elections (2002), the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) appointed Falantil troops to assist in providing local security for these elections. These soldiers received basic training in orders for opening fire and detention procedures. This training was authorised by UNTAET's Office of Defence Force Development and Australian Defence Force personnel assisted in delivering this training.Defence was not responsible for developing a legislative framework for the Timor-Leste security forces. This framework was developed by the United Nations and the transitional Government of Timor-Leste. On 1 February 2001, Falintil officially became Falintil-Forca de Defensa Timor-Leste (F-FDTL). As a response, the Defence Cooperation Program with Timor - Leste was established in 2001. It has assisted Timor-Leste to build a modest, affordable and sustainable defence force.Australia has spent approximately $42 million on the Defence Cooperation Program with Timor-Leste.As part of the Program, Australia has provided civilian advisers within the Timor-Leste Ministry of Defence on budgetary issues and defence policy. Policy advice has sought to link military planning to Government policy, endeavouring to ensure F-FDTL is apolitical.The Australian Army Training Team in Al Muthanna has provided classroom instruction, demonstrations, seminars, one-on-one counselling and mentoring on detainee management, the law of armed conflict, human rights, the rules of engagement and orders for opening fire to the Iraqi Army 2nd Brigade, 10th Division.A United States Department of Defense organisation, Multi National Transitional Command  -  Iraq, has overall responsibility for planning to train, mentor and equip the Iraqi Armed Forces and Police Forces. As part of this command, Australia provides Australian Defence Force advisers to the Iraqi Joint Headquarters and Defence civilian advisers to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence. These advisers provide advice to Iraqi defence officials on subjects including personnel, infrastructure, training, capability, governance and strategic policy. Defence has provided training for Iraqi defence officials in subjects including the law of armed conflict, emergency management, defence and civil-military cooperation.</DOC>

The National Health and Medical Research Council has not received any applications or requests for funding, and is not presently funding any research into the 'Cyber knife' technique for cancer treatment.The product is a medical device and the product sponsor must make application for entry of the device onto the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) prior to supply in Australia. Entry onto the ARTG is dependent upon assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) that the manufacturer holds appropriate evidence of compliance with quality system requirements for the manufacture and evidence to demonstrate quality, safety and performance of the device.Timeframes for the TGA approval process are dependent upon the type of certification held by the manufacturer; if appropriate overseas certification is held, the process would normally take a matter of weeks. If the device requires certification by the TGA, because appropriate overseas certification is not available, the time-frame could be 6  -  9 months, dependent upon the manufacturer's level of documentation and compliance with manufacturing standards.Access to the technology through Medicare is dependent upon the procedure being assessed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee and re-imbursement through private health funds is dependent upon assessment by the Prostheses and Devices Committee.Before a prescription medicine can be marketed in Australia, it needs to be included in the ARTG. In order to register a new medicine in Australia a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) needs to submit an application together with extensive supporting data to the TGA.The TGA evaluates the application to assess the quality, safety and effectiveness of the product when used as intended. The TGA also usually seeks the advice of an independent expert advisory committee, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, before making a decision to approve or reject an application.Laetrile is not registered in Australia. For laetrile to be marketed in Australia, a sponsor would have to make a marketing application to the TGA and supply relevant quality, safety and efficacy data to satisfactorily support its proposed use.There are provisions available under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, whereby patients may obtain access to unregistered medicines where such use is required. These provisions include supply of the drug under the Special Access Scheme (SAS) or for clinical trials, and personal importation.Under Category A of the SAS, a medical practitioner may notify the TGA of their intention to supply an unregistered drug to a patient who is terminally or seriously ill with a life-threatening condition.The import of Laetrile is restricted under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. Its import into Australia therefore requires an import permit. An import permit can be issued by an officer of the TGA once an SAS Category A notification is received from a doctor.It should be noted that the TGA considers the use of unregistered medicines to be experimental, and people wishing to use these products should bear in mind that no assurance can be given regarding their quality, safety or effectiveness. Patients should discuss the use of any unregistered medicines with their medical practitioner to determine whether such a medicine is suitable for them. Medical practitioners using unregistered medicines need to recognise that there may be medico-legal and ethical implications, including the need for informed consent.See (4) above.Laetrile, via Category A of the SAS, has been 'prescribed' by doctors in Australia. The drug is sourced from overseas and the TGA assists with import permission if an exemption avenue such as the SAS Category A has been used by the prescribing doctor.</DOC>

I announced the Terms of Reference for the uranium mining, processing and nuclear energy review on 6 June 2006. The review will contribute to a wide ranging public debate on Australia's future energy needs and the broad range of emerging energy technologies.

Economic issues
The capacity for Australia to increase uranium mining and exports in response to growing global demand.The potential for establishing other steps in the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia, such as fuel enrichment, fabrication and reprocessing, along with the costs and benefits associated with each step.The extent and circumstances in which nuclear energy could in the longer term be economically competitive in Australia with other existing electricity generation technologies, including any implications this would have for the national electricity market.The current state of nuclear energy research and development in Australia and the capacity for Australia to make a significantly greater contribution to international nuclear science.
Environment issues
The extent to which nuclear energy will make a contribution to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions.The extent to which nuclear energy could contribute to the mix of emerging energy technologies in Australia.
Health, safety and proliferation issues
The potential of 'next generation' nuclear energy technologies to meet safety, waste and proliferation concerns.The waste processing and storage issues associated with nuclear energy and current world's best practice.The security implications relating to nuclear energy.The health and safety implications relating to nuclear energy.The terms of reference will provide for an informed and thorough examination of the issues surrounding nuclear energy. The Taskforce will be chaired by Dr Ziggy Switkowski, and includes members highly qualified for the task. These appointees bring a broad range of expertise in nuclear physics, environmental science, health and safety, engineering, economics and commercial management. They provide a well rounded, highly experienced and balanced Taskforce that will allow for an objective and highly professional review of the complex issues outlined in the terms of reference.
The Taskforce will produce a draft report for public consultation in November 2006. A final report will be completed by the end of 2006. The Chief Scientist, Dr Jim Peacock, will support the review, including by facilitating a peer review of the scientific aspects of this review.
When announcing the Taskforce, I said that the Commonwealth itself would not be constructing nuclear power stations, rather they are things that are likely to be constructed by the private sector and therefore the call to name where the power stations are going to be pre-supposes a large number of things.
I also note that radioactive waste to be managed at the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Facility in the Northern Territory is low and intermediate level waste, not high level radioactive waste. The Facility will be neither designed nor licensed to receive such material. Nor will it be designed or licensed to receive radioactive waste produced by other countries. Furthermore, the 
Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005
 specifically prohibits management of high level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel at the Facility.

Federal Budgetand (b)Capital FundingThe Government announced in the 2006-07 Budget that it will be providing additional funding of $95.5 million over four years through the Capital Development Pool (CDP) programme to support higher education providers in developing up-to-date infrastructure for teaching and learning in areas that have high infrastructure needs. This represents a 50 per cent increase in the base funding available to the higher education sector through this programme, commencing in 2007. La Trobe University and RMIT University are eligible to apply for this funding in the next competitive round, for which applications will be called in 2006.Commonwealth Supported PlacesAs part of the Australian Government's contribution to the Council of Australian Governments health workforce and mental health packages, funded in the 2006 - 07 Budget, La Trobe University has been allocated 40 new Commonwealth supported higher education places (20 for nursing and 20 for mental health nursing) and RMIT has been allocated 5 places at its Bundoora campus for mental health nursing. All of these new places will commence in 2007.FEE-HELPThe increase in the FEE-HELP limit as announced in the 2006-07 Budget may result in an increase in the number of domestic fee-paying students at La Trobe University and/or RMIT University Bundoora campus.Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees) Act 2005and (b) An independent assessment, by an organisation chosen by tender, of the economic and other consequences of voluntary student unionism, will be conducted after 18 months of full implementation.To assist with the transition to voluntary student unionism, the Government has committed to a range of funding initiatives. For example, under the Voluntary Student Unionism Transition Fund $80 million will be available over three years commencing in 2007 for the maintenance and construction of sporting and recreational facilities. The Government also announced a $10 million fund to support small businesses on regional university campuses in the 2006-07 Budget.</DOC>

and (2) The Attorney-General has already made a number of public comments on the assistance Australia provided to India in response to its mutual assistance request (see attached press release). It is not appropriate for me to comment on specific operational matters such as who was spoken to and what was said.I can comment on behalf of the Attorney-General's portfolio. Apart from the Attorney - General's Department, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) is the only other portfolio agency that has had communications with the Government of India in relation to this matter.In October 2000, the AFP received a police-to-police request from India, via Interpol, in relation to the same matter as the 2002 mutual assistance request. The AFP subsequently sought the information requested. In February 2001, the AFP replied, via Interpol, to the Indian Police providing the results of the inquiries conducted in response to the request. -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - Media Release 095/200626 May 2006LABOR WRONG AGAIN ON MATTERS BEFORE COLE INQUIRYAustralian authorities cooperated fully with a mutual assistance request in relation to an Indian investigation into wheat sales, contrary to claims by the Labor Party, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said today.In response to India's request, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) sought voluntary witness statements and asked for documents to be provided.Australia informed India of its actions and sought further information for the matter to proceed. The ball was then in India's court. They did not get back to us.If there is sufficient evidence concerning Australian offences, these would be assessed in accordance with normal Australian Federal Police (AFP) processes.As Senator Ellison confirmed at Senate Estimates yesterday: 'There was no evidence to warrant a domestic investigation into possible Australian offences'.Yet Labor seeks to deliberately distort this statement by suggesting it meant the AFP did not investigate when Australia was asked to assist the Indian Government.Labor should know the difference between assisting an Indian investigation in relation to corruption allegations against Indian officials and a domestic investigation into possible Australian offences.This is yet another example of Labor getting its facts wrong. It should let the Commissioner get on with his job, and wait for the outcome of his inquiry.Details of mutual assistance requests are usually confidential between the parties, but in this case it is important to correct the public record to make it abundantly clear the Australian Government did fully cooperate in this matter.The Attorney-General's Department has provided documents to the Cole Inquiry on a confidential basis so the Inquiry can decide whether they raise any issue of interest.Media Contact: Charlie McKillop, Attorney's Office (02) 9251 9303</DOC>

The honourable member's question primarily relates to public health issues and is therefore a matter for the Minister of Health and Ageing to address.
However, I can inform Ms Ellis that the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), within the Health and Ageing portfolio, has set a public health standard for exposure to electromagnetic energy (EME). The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has adopted the limits of this standard in its regulation of public exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and mobile phone towers. Advice from ARPANSA is that the weight of national and international scientific opinion is that there is no substantiated evidence that EME emissions associated with living or working near a mobile phone base - station pose a health risk.
ARPANSA monitors the World Health Organization (WHO) reviews of EME studies and the WHO's current advice is that none of the recent reviews have concluded that exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and their base - stations cause any adverse health consequences.
ARPANSA is currently initiating a mobile phone base-station audit program. It is expected that up to 12 sites will be audited each year. Sites will be selected across all the states. Audits will include the measurement of EME levels from mobile phone base-stations at sites where there is particular public concern.
Individuals in Australia who believe they have suffered ill-effects as a result of exposure to EME can lodge a written complaint with ARPANSA to be put on the Electromagnetic Complaints Register. ARPANSA will protect the privacy of complaints.
The Government provides $1 million each year to the Health and Ageing portfolio, from a levy on radiocommunication licences, for research into public health effects of EME emissions from radiocommunication devices, including mobile phones, and for a public education program.
ACMA and ARPANSA have made available a Mobile Phone Towers and EME Information Pack to further address community concerns about EME. The pack contains Fact Sheets on EME, deployment of mobile phone towers, mobile phone handsets and associated health issues, and information for rural communities on telecommunications facilities.

The Australian Government contracts Volunteering Australia to deliver the VWI on a national basis. The contract has been signed for the continuation of the VWI for 2006-2007.Volunteering Australia sub-contracts VWI services through its national network of service delivery agencies. Volunteering Australia is currently finalising sub-contract negotiations with over 50 service delivery agencies nationally for the provision of VWI services for 2006-2007.Within the listed electorates, the two organisations who were sub-contracted during 2005-2006 were Hunter Volunteer Centre and Volunteering Central Coast. Sub-contract offers have been made to both of these organisations to continue service delivery in 2006-2007. These sub-contracts are currently being negotiated with the organisations considering the terms and conditions of the sub-contract variations.As noted in the response to question 1 above, Volunteering Australia is currently in the process of negotiating sub-contracts with its national network of service delivery agencies. Under the terms of the Australian Government's contract with Volunteering Australia, a finalised list of sub-contractors will be provided to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations by 31 July 2006.If each of the organisations being offered sub-contracts accept them on the proposed terms and conditions, the sub-contracts are effective from 1 July 2006, ensuring continuity of contracts. Both organisations are currently continuing to operate  -  providing information and referral services to income support recipients  -  while contracts are finalised.Sub-contract offers have been made to providers by Volunteering Australia for the period 2006-2007, and they are currently being finalised. While the Government approves the list of sub-contractors Volunteering Australia proposes, the negotiation of these sub-contracts is a matter for Volunteering Australia.</DOC>

The cost of establishing the access card system is $1.09 billion over four years. For commercial reasons, detailed information regarding costs, including the cost of registering Australians for the Health and Social Services (HSS) access card is not publicly available.Yes, the cost of $1.09 billion over four years to introduce the HSS access card includes funding for the registration of Australians for the access card. However, as noted in the response to question (1), information regarding the estimated cost of registration is not publicly available.See response to question (1).See response to question (2).The Government does not intend to build all Smartcard infrastructure such as cards, readers and microchips. This is not core government business. Therefore it is obvious that the private sector will need to service its equipment.Advice that the introduction of the HSS access card will increase the appeal and practice of identity theft has not been received by the Minister for Human Services, the Smart Technologies and Services Taskforce or the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce. Indeed, as the KPMG Health and Social Services Smart Card Initiative, Volume 1: Business Case notes:'KPMG considers that greater trust in the overall system will be strengthened by consumers being confident that their card cannot be used by someone else. Having a photograph on the card and all the other securities in place, in our view, is likely to strengthen that confidence.' (Public Extract, Page 18).The abilities of staff from the Department of Human Services or its agencies to confiscate or deactivate access cards is not yet determined, this will be the subject of detailed design work and the advice of the Lead Advisor and Chief Technology Architect.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 2 hours and 21 minutes at an estimated cost of $137.</DOC>

Yes.The ATO is not aware of any Australian studies that reliably measure taxation non-compliance. The ATO uses risk assessment approach to target taxpayer non-compliance.The article in the Sydney Morning Herald refers to a statement on page 93 of the ATO's Compliance Program 2005-06, and claims that it states that 'evasion is confined to a small number of people'. The article goes on to canvass a range of anecdotes regarding the practices that people undertake to evade taxes, and the amount of revenue that might be at risk. No evidence was stated in support of those estimates.The ATO believes that the correct reference would have been to page 89, where the following statement is in fact made:'A small number of people deliberately engage in criminal behaviour to evade their tax obligations or fraudulently use the system to obtain an improper financial benefit.'Relative to the total population of taxpayers, only a small number are engaged in criminal behaviour as described in the Evasion and Serious Fraud chapter of the Compliance Program. The ATO's Compliance Program demonstrates that the ATO is active and effective in addressing such behaviour.</DOC>

 BENEFITS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SALARY PACKAGING
2.2
 
 What is Fringe Benefits Tax?
Generally speaking, the benefit items which are attractive for salary packaging purposes are therefore limited to those which are exempt from FBT, or upon which FBT is concessionally taxed (e.g. novated lease motor vehicle, superannuation and payments to certain child care centres) or those that are otherwise deductible (e.g. professional membership fees, personal computers).
(2.1 page 7)
2.4
 
 Salary Package Items ('The Menu')
Child-care fees are also an attractive benefit to salary package, as FBT does not apply to them in certain circumstances. However, child-care fees are only exempt from FBT where the child-care is conducted on business premises of the Commonwealth Government, i.e. a building owned or leased by any Commonwealth Department or statutory authority.Child-care fees in respect of the Currawong Child Care Centre in the DFAT building in Canberra are also exempt from FBT, because of a private ruling received from the Australian Taxation Office. Salary Packaging child-care fees means that they can be paid from pre-tax dollars.
(2.4 page 9)
8.
    
 WHERE TO FROM HERE?
Step 2 - Estimate Benefit, Seek Financial AdviceThe employee should investigate the non-cash benefit (e.g. additional superannuation, novated lease car or child care) they wish to salary package. The employee should consider how much they might be currently spending on the benefit, from after-tax income, and give some thought to how their personal finances might be improved by salary packaging the benefit instead.

The Minister is aware of the article.The Government believes it is in the public interest to abolish the position.There is an inherent conflict of interest between the clear legal duty of a Director to act in good faith and in the best interests of the ABC (imposed by the ABC Act, the CAC Act and backed up by Bennetts v Board of Fire Commissioners) and being elected by staff who may primarily expect the staff-elected Director to represent their interests rather than the interests of the ABC as a whole. The Government believes the changes remove the potential for a conflict of interest.Legislation to abolish the staff-elected Director position on the ABC board has passed through both Houses of Parliament and received Royal Assent.</DOC>

The Minister is aware of the website.The Minister is aware the website contains a petition which claims to have over 77,000 signatures.No. The ABC's figures in its Annual Reports show that all of the claimed decline in funding occurred in the late 1980s and early '90s.While the Government does not agree with all elements of the ABC's calculations, nonetheless, last year's ABC Annual Report showed that the level of ABC funding in 2005-06 was very similar to the 1995-96 level (indexed by CPI). This analysis does not include approximately $600 million in additional funding the Government is providing over the decade from 2000-01 for the ABC's digital TV costs.With the new funding announced in the Budget 2006-07, ABC funding in 2006-07 will exceed the level of the ABC's funding in 1995 - 96 (indexed by CPI) even before the Government's substantial contribution for digital television is added.</DOC>

No. While ADF personnel have been on operation in Afghanistan from 2001 and Iraq from 2003, the creation of the campaign medals for Afghanistan and Iraq was only announced on 25 April 2004.Following the announcement of the creation of the campaign medals in April 2004, the Letters Patent and Regulations establishing the medals were approved by Her Majesty the Queen in October 2004. A competitive tendering process for the manufacture, engraving and dispatch of the medals was undertaken, with a contract being signed in April 2005. Some quality difficulties were encountered with medals manufactured by the original contractor and this contract was terminated. Defence then entered into an arrangement with the Royal Australian Mint, and full production of the medals commenced in February 2006.No. As the delay in providing the campaign medals to eligible Australian Defence Force personnel is related to the manufacturing of the medal, the issue of additional staff has not been considered.None. ADF members have already been recognised for their service in Afghanistan and Iraq with the Australian Active Service Medal with appropriate clasp. Defence is working very hard to ensure that all servicemen and women get the recognition they deserve. While a level of frustration may have been experienced by ADF members in receiving the medal, it should not have an impact on retention.The Mint is currently manufacturing 500 medals per week. Over 2,500 Afghanistan Campaign Medals and over 4,500 Iraq Campaign Medals have been issued to date. The majority of the remaining campaign medals are expected to be issued to eligible personnel by August 2006.</DOC>

For this reason, the medal is inscribed with the words 'for service'.Significant consultation occurred with individuals, ex-Service organisations and the ADF.

As at 30 June 2006, 31,296 medals have been despatched.Applications from ex-serving ADF members and reservists are being assessed in order of receipt. Permanent ADF members are being assessed automatically with medals being issued to the most junior members first.After an application is received the applicant must be assessed to confirm eligibility. The period between receipt of the application and award of the medal will, therefore, depend on the number of applications being received, the individual circumstances of each applicant and the resources available. Once assessed as eligible, applicants can expect to be awarded the medal within three to four months.and (g) Applications requiring further research are being acknowledged within a four to six week time frame. All other applications are assessed on receipt, but are not acknowledged. This decision was made due to the limited number of resources available, and to ensure that the assessing function continues.Yes, 16 additional staff members have been employed to process applications for the Australian Defence Medal, and the Directorate of Honours and Awards has recently signed a contract for the research and assessment services for the medal, which will further increase the number of staff processing applications.</DOC>

Current serving Permanent members are identified through an automatic list generated by the personnel database. Reserve members need to formally apply, as their effective service data is not recorded by the personnel database. In addition, inactive Reserve Force members need to provide updated contact details.Yes. It is necessary for eligible serving Reserve Force members to apply for the Australian Defence Medal as their details of effective service are not captured by the personnel database. However, in accordance with an updated Defence Instruction, 'active' Reserve Force members can provide a letter from their Commanding Officer certifying that they have completed four years service. In addition, 'inactive' Reserve Force members need to provide updated contact details for the despatch of the medal.

Based on information provided by Australia Post:From 22 May 2006 Australia Post has ceased providing letter holding and redirection services to eligible pensioners for free, and is now providing these services on a concessional basis. Holders of Centrelink Pensioner Concession cards, Department of Veteran Affairs Pensioner Concession cards, and Centrelink Health Care (Sickness Allowance) will now pay half of the standard rate for these services. As a transitional measure, Australia Post gave existing users of these services the opportunity to extend their current services for up to 12 months free of charge.Australia Post has advised that it has made this decision because the cost of providing mail holding and redirection services for free has grown prohibitive. Historically, Australia Post had absorbed the cost of providing mail redirection and mail holding services to pensioners. The services were intended to provide a temporary solution for customers who may be moving from one address to another or absent from their home for a short period.According to Australia Post, in 2004-05 pensioners accounted for around 25% of all mail redirection/holding applicants, many of whom have been using the service on a continual basis, rather than as the temporary solution it is intended to be. It now costs the Corporation $5.7 million per year to provide these services for free.Under the new arrangements, all applications lodged by eligible concession cardholders from 22 May 2006, pensioners will be charged a concessional rate for mail redirection and mail holding services. The concessional rate for mail redirection is $5.50 for one month and $11.50 for a three month period. The concessional rate for mail holding is $5.50 for the first month and $2.00 for each additional month. Australia Post has advised that this concessional rate is consistent with the pensioner concessions offered by other service organisations.Prior to the introduction of these fees, Post undertook extensive consultation with key stake holder groups, including the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Retired Persons Association and the Council of the Ageing/National Seniors.Australia Post has advised that it does not have any current plans to change mail redirection and holding fees for eligible pensioners during the 2006-07 financial year.</DOC>

Australia does not use a measure of GDP (or GNP) per capita to measure overseas aid. The relevant index used in determining Official Development Assistance (ODA) as a measure of economic activity is the Gross National Income (GNI). The Australian Bureau of Statistics changed its measure of the amount of national economic activity from the Gross National Product (GNP) to the GNI in 1998, in line with international standards. Generally, GNI figures are slightly higher than corresponding GNP figures. Australia's ODA to GNI ratio for 2006-07 is estimated at 0.30 per cent. ODA volume for 2006-07 is estimated at $2.95 billion.Please refer to answer (1). A 2005 calendar-year comparison of ODA to GNI ratios for OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries places Australia 19th of 22 countries. It should be noted that Australia's aid allocations are volume based and not based on a percentage of GNI or any relative DAC rankings.The third annual Commitment to Development Index, published by the Centre for Global Development, compares donor country policies on development. It ranks Australia fourth out of 21 nations. Australia ranks equal first for its performance on security, and second for its performance on trade.The 2006-07 Budget is the sixth consecutive budget that has delivered real growth in ODA. In 2006-07, Australia will provide an estimated $2.95 billion in ODA, an increase of $455 million over the 2005-06 Budget or a 15.5 per cent real increase budget-to-budget. There has been an overall percentage increase in Australian overseas aid across the previous five years of 62.7 per cent based on current prices and using a projected increase for 2005-06 (actual outcomes not yet available).and (5) Please refer to answer (1). Reliable projected future comparisons between aid donor countries to 2015 are not available. Comparisons based on projected ODA/GNI ratios would depend on varying economic growth rates and the extent to which donors delivered against their announced commitments. Australia's goal of increasing Australian ODA to around $4 billion by 2010 is subject to annual review and aid effectiveness. It is also conditional on strengthened governance and reduced corruption in recipient countries.In the Australian Government's view the announced goal of increasing ODA to around $4 billion by 2010 represents an appropriate Australian contribution to international efforts to increase official financing for development. Based on OECD estimates of GNI, an Australian ODA allocation of around $4 billion by 2010, would give an ODA/GNI ratio of approximately 0.36 per cent.13 per cent for 2004-05 (2005-06 figures not yet available)3 per cent for 2004-05 (2005-06 figures not yet available)31 per cent for governance for 2004-05 (2005-06 figures not yet available)Security, policing and 'democracy building' are subsets of aid program expenditure on governance.and (8) AusAID's activity management system does not currently provide information on aid funding expensed through Australian contractors. The resources/costs involved in manually gathering this information are not justified. Details of AusAID contracts are published on AusTender.It should be noted that published contract limits reflect a range of expenditure categories, including funds managed by developing country sub-contractors or local aid delivery agents, reimbursable costs as well as agreed management fees.Historical and anticipated Australian ODA flows by country are set out in detail on page xv of the Aid Budget Statement - Australia's Overseas Aid Program 2006-07.(a) The International Monetary Fund, through its World Economic Outlook Database, April 2006, provides a listing of the Ten Poorest Nations in the World 2005.Ten Poorest Nations in the World 2005

Grants to Australian Organisations Program
The Attorney-General's Department administers grant funding under the Grants to Australian Organisations Program (GAOP).The GAOP is not advertised.The GAOP is a discretionary grants program. Grants are made to Australian organisations to assist them with projects or activities focussed on the pursuit of an equitable and accessible system of federal civil justice.As Attorney-General, I approve grants under the GAOP.No funding was received by any community organisation, business or individual within the electoral division of Charlton under the GAOP in the 2003 - 04 financial year.
The Family Relationship Services Program
children, young people and adults in all their diversity are enabled to develop and sustain safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships; andthe emotional, social and economic costs associated with disruption to family relationships are minimised.The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and I are jointly responsible for allocating funds for family relationship counselling under the FRSP. As Attorney-General, I am responsible for the remainder of FRSP referred to in part (1).
Legal Aid Program
The Attorney - General's Department administers the Commonwealth Legal Aid Program through which the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales is funded to provide legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth laws. The Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales has regional offices located at 51 - 55 Bolton Street, Newcastle NSW 2300 and Level 2, 37 William Street, Gosford NSW 2250, through which individuals and organisations in the electoral division of Charlton can apply for legal assistance.The Attorney - General's Department does not advertise the Commonwealth Legal Aid Program. The Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales may advertise its services from time to time.The purpose of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Program is to ensure disadvantaged persons are able to access legal services for matters arising under Commonwealth laws.The Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales is responsible for providing legal assistance services for matters arising under Commonwealth laws under an agreement with the Commonwealth. The agreement provides for the provision of a range of services including grants of aid for legal representation.Some individuals or organisations located in the electorate of Charlton may have received grants of legal assistance for matters arising under Commonwealth laws. However privacy guidelines prevent the disclosure of information in relation to the recipients of legal aid grants and statistical information on the provision of grants of legal assistance is not collected on the basis of electoral divisions.
Financial Assistance Program
The Attorney - General's Department administers schemes for the provision of financial assistance for legal and associated costs. These schemes exist to provide legal or financial assistance in cases where legal aid is not generally available from legal aid commissions and where the circumstances give rise to a special Commonwealth interest. People and organisations in the electoral division of Charlton can apply for assistance directly from the Australian Government under these schemes. It has been a long - standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys - General, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence and not to provide information in relation to individual applications.
Community Legal Services Program
The Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program is a national program which provides funding to community organisations for the provision of legal and related services to those in need. However, funding under the program is currently fully committed on a recurrent basis.When new funding becomes available, the allocation of funds to any new community legal services is undertaken through a competitive tendering process following a needs - based assessment of possible locations. When such funding opportunities arise, paid advertisements are placed in the primary State newspapers and relevant local newspapers.The purpose of the Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program is to provide free and accessible legal information and/or advice to disadvantaged members of the community who are not eligible for legal aid and who cannot afford a private solicitor.The Attorney - General's Department administers funding to community legal centres under the Commonwealth Community Legal Services Program. The Department provides recommendations to me on the allocation of any new funding under the program.There are no community legal centres funded by the Community Legal Services Program in the electoral division of Charlton.
Indigenous Law and Justice Advocacy Program
The Attorney - General's Department administers grant funding under the Indigenous Law and Justice Advocacy Program. These funds are available for advocacy projects and legal test cases that would have a significant impact on the rights of Indigenous Australians.Public advertisements are placed by the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination towards the end of each calendar year for all Commonwealth grant - funded programs for Indigenous Australians. Such advertisements appear in national, State-wide, regional and Indigenous-specific newspapers.The exact cost of this advertising cannot readily be identified from other costs that were borne by the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination in relation to the program.I have appointed a delegate, who is responsible for allocating funds in accordance with program guidelines. These guidelines are available on the Department's website.The purpose of the Indigenous Law and Justice Advocacy Program is to support Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committees, Deaths in Custody Watch Committees and relevant research and education projects.I have appointed a delegate, who is responsible for allocating funds in accordance with program guidelines. These guidelines are available on the Department's website.Under the Indigenous Law and Justice Advocacy Program, Yulawirri Nurai Indigenous Association received funding of $80,040 in 2003 - 04 and $95,040 in 2004 - 05. The Yulawirri Nurai Indigenous Association is located at 43 Dora Street, Morisset NSW 2264.
Indigenous Prevention, Diversion, Rehabilitation and Restorative Justice Program

Legal Aid for Indigenous Australians
The Attorney - General's Department administers the Indigenous Legal Aid Program.

The core rules of the consolidation regime were introduced in 2002. Since that time, an additional 44 measures have been introduced. 19 of those measures insert new provisions into the income tax law to cover areas not dealt with initially. The remaining 25 measures clarify the operation of the law and ensure it operates as intended.The consolidation regime represented a major structural reform to the taxation of corporate groups. The Government actively consulted with business and professional groups during the development of the legislation to implement the regime. In this regard, at the First National Consolidation Symposium in February 2003, Ken Spence of Shaddick &amp; Spence stated that 'the formulation of the consolidation provisions should be seen as a benchmark in consultation with tax professional bodies and associations'.The Government has continued to consult with business and professional groups to ensure that the consolidation regime is operating effectively. The amendments have been made in response to issues raised by those groups as they get practical experience in applying the consolidation regime. Those amendments have enhanced the operation of the consolidation regime by addressing issues affecting special classes of taxpayers and by clarifying extensive interactions with other parts of the income tax. No substantial amendments have been made to modify the core rules or to correct errors.Information in respect of consultation at the policy and/or draft legislation stage on announced tax and superannuation measures is available on the Treasury website and is updated three times a year..The website provides details of the consultation strategy on announced tax and superannuation measures and the progress of consultation.The number of consultations conducted using confidentiality agreements is a function of the type and number of consultations conducted and therefore varies from year to year.</DOC>

Although responsibility for the day-to-day administration of SAAP rests with the State and Territory Governments, the Australian Government is very serious about its commitment to provide support for homeless people. As a result, the Australian Government will contribute $931 million in funding to States and Territory Governments to help them meet their responsibilities in this area. Details of Australian Government funding to States and Territories under SAAP V is set out in the SAAP V Multilateral Agreement (available online at www.facsia.gov.au/aboutfacs/programs/house-saapv).SAAP funding figures up to and including 2004-05 are available in the annual data reports for SAAP, Homeless People in SAAP  -  SAAP NDC Annual Report (available on-line at www.aihw.gov.au). They are also published in the statistical supplement to the Report on Government Services (available online at www.pc.gov.au/gsp).The Multilateral Agreement for SAAP V was signed on 30 September 2005 and the Bilateral Agreements with the States and Territories were signed over the period 25 January to 31 January 2006.SAAP data on people assisted and unable to be assisted on an average day is collected by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) in a demand survey conducted twice a year. The methodology is explained in the AIHW report Demand for SAAP accommodation by homeless people 2003-04.The SAAP National Data Collection 2004-05 and the AIHW report Demand for SAAP accommodation by homeless people 2003-04 are both available on the AIHW website (www.aihw.gov.au).SAAP does not fund beds. It funds support services to people in accommodation managed or accessed by SAAP agencies. SAAP is not administered by electoral division nor is such data readily available.</DOC>

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is unable to consider an application for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidy for a medicine outside its terms of registration. The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved the registration of the extension of indications for trastuzumab (Herceptin®) for use by women with early breast cancer on 21 April 2006.On 17 March 2006 Roche Products submitted an application to PBAC for PBS listing of trastuzumab for the early breast cancer indication.At its July 2006 meeting, PBAC recommended that the Australian Government subsidise, under the PBS, the drug trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with HER-2 positive early stage breast cancer following surgery, for a maximum period of 12 months to be commenced concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy.PBAC further specified that:- Eligible patients would require a HER-2 gene amplification test to ensure that they are in the group for which the drug is clinically effective.- The sponsor company, Roche Pharmaceuticals, would need to enter some commitments to ensure that the listing could go ahead, particularly in regard to unnecessary wastage and alerting PBAC to fuller studies on optimal dose and duration of treatment.- Patients who have a particular vulnerability to heart damage should not receive the drug.Negotiations with the company and formalisation of conditions of listing are in progress. The outcome of these negotiations will inform Government consideration of the PBAC recommendation.Because the dosage of trastuzumab relates principally to body weight, the cost of treatment can vary between patients. The Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee estimates the average cost of treatment for one year as approximately $67,000.Yes.Yes.No. Consultations between a doctor and patient are private.Yes. The registration and consideration of trastuzumab for PBS listing for the new patient group have been managed as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to comply with legal requirements to ensure that the drug is safe, effective and cost effective for this group.</DOC>

The Hansard and transcripts of my comments are readily available.and (3) ABS publication 5302.0 contains the latest estimates of the CAD, including revisions.Australia is a large, resource rich country with a high demand for capital, and has relied upon foreign investment to meet these needs over most of its history. The result has been persistent CADs  -  or net lending from the rest of the world, which have resulted in a higher standard of living compared to a situation of no net lending.By running budget surpluses while economic growth is strong, the Commonwealth Government does not contribute to the CAD, but instead adds to Australia's national saving. The Commonwealth Government has delivered seven cash budget surpluses in the last eight years, with the budget for 2006-07 forecast to be a surplus of $10.8 billion. This represents a turnaround from the situation for the majority of the 1980s and early 1990s, when the Commonwealth Government was a major contributor to the CAD.</DOC>

This is an issue for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), I am advised that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is responding to Question on Notice 3436.This is an issue for the Department of Defence.Customs has an informal arrangement with Sea Ranger groups. Customs provides training to indigenous communities in the Northern Territory on what type of information Customs is interested in receiving in respect of border protection under its Community Participation Program (CPP). Customs also uses Sea Ranger groups to: facilitate introductions to key personnel in indigenous communities, act as guides to indigenous community out-stations and geographical locations in their area, participate in land and sea patrols and provide charter boats if available to assist with responses.Yes. Sea Ranger groups regularly report unusual activity to the Customs Hotline number 1800 06 1800. Customs seeks to provide feedback to reporters that can include confirmation of report details and potential response. In some instances sea rangers are asked to monitor the activity and provide updated reports to facilitate foreign fishing vessel apprehensions.The Government has no such policy.Customs will pay for services if they use Sea Ranger assets or officers in patrol or response activities.Customs has trained approximately 80 individual Sea Rangers in the past two years in the Northern Territory under the Customs CPP.Customs has provided items such as caps and mugs, which have the Customs Hotline Logo and 1800 06 1800 number inscribed on them. There is no intent to provide sugar, flour or tobacco.</DOC>

(b) The revenue collected from NICNAS registrants this current financial year, up to 31 March 2006, is $4,293,840.For this registration year, which commenced on 1 September 2005, NICNAS has registered 5,600 companies or individuals, as at 14 June 2006.All companies and individuals who register with NICNAS pay the annual registration fee of $353., (b) and (c) It is not NICNAS's practice to collect actual import and/or manufacturing values for relevant industrial chemicals based on a policy to ensure no unreasonable administrative cost to industry. NICNAS asks companies and individuals to estimate their Tier for registration purposes. First registration requires that the prescribed form is completed including actual value but this is not mandated. Renewal forms simply require a self estimate of Tier. In relation to import values, an examination of the data provided by the Australian Customs Service for 2004-05 for companies or individuals importing relevant industrial chemicals estimates that:- 821 imported less than $5,000;- 621 imported less than $3,000;- 307 imported less than $1,000.In accordance with the Australian Government's cost recovery policy, cost recovery arrangements for NICNAS were reviewed in 2004-05 to ensure they complied with guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and Administration. NICNAS registration fees and charges are scheduled to be reviewed during 2009-10, as part of the overall review of NICNAS cost recovery arrangements.and (b) The NICNAS compliance team monitors all companies importing or manufacturing relevant industrial chemicals to ensure that they are registered in compliance with the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. For the registration year commencing 1 September 2005, as at 14 June 2006, NICNAS has made follow up enquiries into the registration obligations of 1,636 companies or individuals. NICNAS has investigated 514 companies or individuals this registration year. There have been no fines or prosecutions.</DOC>

A firm advertisement date was not provided at that point, as explained in the letter, to avoid confusion in the industry in case of delays due to unforeseen circumstances.The RFT was conducted in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The RFT was placed on the AusTender website, the DVA website (www.dva.gov.au), in one national newspaper and major metropolitan newspapers in each State and Territory.The RFT was open to all providers of community nursing services and DVA considered all applications that met the requirements of the RFT.The RFT outlined the process by which the Department would fill any gaps that might occur in the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers at the end of the tender process. The tender process was completed in April 2006 and the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers came into effect on 1 May 2006.approaching the members of the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers to determine their interest and capacity to fill gaps; andapproaching other community nursing providers that did not participate in the tender process to fill gaps that could not be filled by the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers.One of the fundamental principles of the CPGs is undertaking procurement processes that ensure value for money.The aim of the RFT was to ensure that veterans and war widows/widowers continue to receive quality community nursing services. The Department has implemented a transition strategy to ensure that any veterans and war widows/widowers that have to transfer community nursing providers as a result of the outcomes of the tender process, will have a seamless transition between providers to ensure continuity of care and minimum disruption to the veteran or widow/widower.The Department has identified, and is currently addressing, a number of gaps in the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers in rural and remote areas. Maryborough District Health Service has been invited to apply to fill one of these gaps. Any community nursing provider who is direct sourced must meet all of the requirements of the original RFT to be offered a Deed of Standing Offer to join the panel of DVA-contracted community nursing providers.Yes.</DOC>

Australia follows the Council of Europe Guidelines for the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components. These guidelines provide the gold standard for blood transfusion services and form the basis for many national guidelines within and outside Europe.While not a requirement under the Council of Europe Guidelines, Australia does use Filtered Red Cell Transfusion Technology for removing white blood cells from blood products (a process known as leucodepletion). There are two types of leucodepleted blood products currently available in Australia - red cells and platelets.It is up to individual states and territories to place orders for the specific blood products they require under the national blood supply arrangements. There has been a national trend towards the purchase of leucodepleted products, with nearly all states and territories ordering 100% leucodepleted platelets for 2006-07.I am aware of recent media concerns in relation to benefits of leucodepleted versus non - leucodepleted products. It is recognised that the removal of white blood cells from blood products provides a number of clinical benefits for patients, including a reduction in adverse transfusion reactions and complications in patients with compromised immune systems. It is a matter for treating physicians to determine the most appropriate use of leucodepleted products based on best clinical outcomes for the patients under their care.The Australian Government supports the purchase of leucodepleted products required by the states and territories by contributing 63% towards their costs.</DOC>

In September 1993 the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation, the Commonwealth Trading Bank, the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the Commonwealth Development Bank were listed in Part I of Schedule 2 to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act). Part I of Schedule 2 to the FOI Act lists bodies which are deemed to be not subject to the FOI Act.Yes.The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is not subject to the FOI Act as it does not fall within the definition of an 'agency' in the FOI Act. Therefore, the CBA is not referred to in the FOI Act or the Schedules to the FOI Act, and it is not required to respond to an FOI request. The bodies referred to in the answer to Part (1) of the question were removed from Part I of Schedule 2 to the FOI Act as a result of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995.No. It would not be appropriate for the Attorney-General to provide legal advice in relation to such matters.</DOC>

Yes, I am aware of the comments.On 22 December 2005, the Government released its Biofuels Action Plan, which consists of individual Action Plans drawn up by the major oil companies, members of the Independent Petroleum Group, and the major retailers. These set out volumetric goals and business plans, including marketing and retail strategies, for both ethanol and biodiesel blended fuels. Based on the plans submitted, the industry expects to exceed the Government's biofuels target of at least 350 megalitres by 2010.The Government is monitoring the progress towards the biofuels target and I am confident that the industry is on track to achieve it by 2010.In 2006 there have been a number of new contracts that have been signed, and announcements made by the oil majors and the biofuels industry. The level of activity by the industry, in conjunction with the Government's new and existing support for biofuels, indicates that the industry is well placed to achieve the 2010 target.</DOC>

The other is entitled the Personal Guide (orange coloured folder) and was delivered with Personal Forms. The Australian Statistician has advised that some Personal Guides were delivered with Household Forms, which may have given rise to a perception that some information in the booklet did not match the form.The Australian Statistician further advises that no booklets are known to be incorrect, this should not result in any incorrect information being collected and that no additional work will be required.</DOC>

These addressed a range of obligations including those relating to income tax, PAYG, GST and Excise.An additional 2,400 visits to businesses were conducted by field officers to review risks and issues in industries not in the cash economy program.With the tools now available under the New Tax System and the range of approaches being employed by the ATO, it is more likely than ever before that those not meeting their obligations will be detected and brought to account.The ATO also has augmented its efforts to identify and deal with people who are operating outside the system by implementing an expanded program of data matching. Data-matching enables the ATO to draw information together from a variety of internal and external sources to identify potential areas of risk and to highlight individual's circumstances which are worthy of review.The ATO uses data matching in a variety of ways:it facilitates the identification of undeclared income and assists in the efficient allocation of compliance resources; andmatches lists obtained from sources outside the ATO with ATO records to detect people who are operating outside the tax system.The ATO is and will continue to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Commissioner and all information obtained under the data matching programme is subject to strict privacy and confidentiality safeguards.</DOC>

The Minister is aware of the article.The mandatory Australian Content Standard set by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) does not apply to the national broadcasters, which are given independence in programming decisions by their enabling legislation.The Government provides the ABC with over $800 million a year in funding and it is the role of the ABC Board to allocate resources as it sees fit.The 2006-07 Budget provided $30.0 million over three years to enable the ABC to establish an independent commissioning arm to invest in high quality drama and documentaries from the Australian independent production sector. This funding will assist in addressing the reduction in Australian content on ABC television over recent years and provide a significant boost to the local production sector.</DOC>

to (3)The sum of money expended on leadership coaching in the Department during the 2005-06 financial year is a total of $10,360.73 (excluding travel expenses). The cost per hour of the leadership coaches has been as follows:Secretary - $924.91 average per session for three sessions (excluding travel expenses)First Assistant Secretary - $250 for one 1-hour sessionAssistant Secretary (1) - $2475 for two x 2.5 hour sessionsAssistant Secretary (2) - $900 approx for a series of sessions over 9 monthsAssistant Secretary (3) - $350 per hour x 9.5 hours (excluding travel expenses)Assistant Secretary (4) - $386 for one 1-hour sessionEL2 - $250 for one 1-hour session.In addition, 372 Executive Level staff have received a single one-on-one individual follow-up training session as part of their participation in their Executive Leadership Programme. This programme equips DIMA Executive Level staff to be effective leaders and to support cultural change in the Department. The follow-up session is included in the cost of the programme.This leadership training is a direct response to the recommendations of the Palmer and Comrie reports, which identified leadership as a critical factor in the Department's improved performance. Well trained and supported staff is a key theme of the Department's change and improvement programme. The government has invested an additional $780 million in new and redirected funding over the period 2005-06 to 2009-10 in this change agenda.</DOC>

All personnel assigned to HMAS Huon and HMAS Hawkesbury have previously served on a Huon-class vessel or been appropriately trained in the full functionality of the vessels.Both crews will be drawn from either existing Huon-class crews or other parts of the Navy.One reserve officer is currently serving on Huon. This officer will leave in August 2006. There is currently no intention to use other reserve personnel for crew augmentation.Yes. Customs, Fisheries, Quarantine, Australian Federal Police and other Australian Defence Force personnel may be embarked on an as required basis.Crews would have been employed within the Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Force Element Group or in other Navy positions suitable to their qualifications.and (b) HMAS Huon was not taken out of service, but was deactivated. Huon is in the process of being reactivated. HMAS Hawkesbury was never deactivated and is currently en route to commence operations in northern Australian waters. The total cost for reactivation of Huon is expected to be approximately $2.6 million.Hawkesbury will be available to commence patrol duties on or around the end of July 2006 and Huon will be available on or around the beginning of November 2006.The task will be met on an ongoing basis by rotating Huon and Hawkesbury. Defence does not anticipate the need to use other vessels once Huon and Hawkesbury commence patrol duties.</DOC>

No specific agreements or arrangements exist between the Department of Defence and the Northern Territory Government in relation to the Joint Facility Pine Gap. The Facility and the agencies who manage it, the Australian Department of Defence and the United States Department of Defense, maintain good working relations with a number of local and Northern Territory Government agencies and departments. Issues are dealt with on a case-by-case basis as they arise.
Any actions at the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap that have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on the environment must be referred to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for further consideration under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999).

For Financial Year 2005-06, $8,752,615 (excluding GST).For Financial Year 2005-06, US$16,625,524 (equivalent to $23,750,749 Australian currency).Negotiations concluded in late February 2006. Defence formally advised the United States (US) Navy of its acceptance of the proposed draft wording of the new agreement on 10 March 2006, and requested that the US Navy provide formal advice of its own acceptance. Such advice is still outstanding.In the interim, Defence and the US Navy have agreed in writing to continue the existing agreement until such time as the new treaty and technical arrangements are implemented.The schedule for the finalisation of the new agreement was on track until late September 2005, when face-to-face discussions on the sole remaining issue for negotiation were conducted in Washington. The US Navy was expected to advise Australia of their acceptance of this issue at this meeting, but did not in fact do so until February 2006.Although Australia has now forwarded a formal acceptance of the draft agreed text to the US Navy, the US Defense Office of General Counsel has not yet reciprocated with formal notification of its acceptance of the draft agreed text. In the absence of the US Defense General Counsel's formal acceptance, Australia is unable to proceed with obtaining Executive Council approval to sign an agreed text. Consequently, the remainder of the ratification process for the agreement, including review by Parliament, will also be delayed. It is estimated that at least six months from the time of receipt of the US Defense General Counsel's formal acceptance of the draft text will be required before the new agreement can proceed to signature.</DOC>

Agreement on the text of a MoU on Trade in Live Animals has been reached with Qatar and officials are optimistic that signature will occur before the end of 2006. Good progress has been made in negotiating MoUs with Oman, Bahrain, Iran and Egypt. Preliminary discussions on MoUs have occurred with Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Israel and Iraq.
 
Countries in the Middle East region that import Australian animals but have not yet signed MoUs on the trade in live animals are subject to additional export measures which are aimed at reducing the risks associated with exporting livestock to those countries. These measures include, inter alia, requirements on exporters to carry additional fodder, additional space requirements, increased scrutiny of contingency plans and certain shipping conditions.It is not clear when all the MoU under negotiations will be signed. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is actively pursuing progress on all MoUs on trade in live animals.</DOC>

The Ombudsman is currently investigating a number of cases with the descriptor 'released not unlawful'. The Ombudsman investigates the administrative actions of departments and can report on actions that he believes were unlawful. Accordingly, the Ombudsman may report on whether or not the 'released not unlawful' cases involve 'wrongful detention.' To date, the Ombudsman has only reported on the Mr T case, in which he found that (paragraph 2.4): 'It is probable - though only a court of competent jurisdiction could conclusively determine this issue after a proper trial of the matter - that Mr T's detention for at least part of the overall period of detention was unlawful, lacking any reasonable suspicion to support the view that he was an unlawful non-citizen.'to (5) Any instances of 'wrongful detention' will be considered by the Ombudsman, so answers to these questions are not yet available.</DOC>

The number of people estimated to reside in each detention centre in 2006-07 is difficult to predict with certainty. This is due to detainee populations and demographics being subject to rapid changes and external factors. However, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimates that around 9,800 people will need to be accommodated in the onshore detention network during 2006-07.This detention caseload is expected to comprise:Illegal Foreign Fishers (IFFs) - approximately 6,000;visa overstayers and breaches - approximately 3,000;people refused entry at air or sea ports - approximately 700; andother unauthorised arrivals including via sea  -  approximately 100.IFFs will be accommodated in the Northern Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) with the overflow going to Baxter IDC. Visa overstayers and breaches and those refused entry will be assessed individually and appropriately accommodated within the onshore detention network. This will be in an IDC or a Residential Housing Centre. In some cases, a residence determination may be granted by the Minister to allow women, children or families to live in the community with non-government agency support.The detention network has the capacity to respond to the accommodation needs of detainees at this level of predicted demand and provide sufficient contingency capacity should there be a surge in detainee numbers.</DOC>

Costs to 28 March 2006 associated with the processing of the claims for protection made by the 43 Indonesians from Papua Province, who arrived in Australia at Cape York in January 2006, amounted to some $270,000, including associated travel costs.Around 29 per cent of the expenditure of processing the claims for asylum set out in (1) above can be attributed to conducting the process on Christmas Island.All asylum claims are judged on their merits and are not influenced by other considerations.The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) commenced systems-generated reporting of time taken to process initial protection visa applications from 1 January 1999. DIMA records as at 24 March 2006 indicate that the average number of days taken from lodgement to primary decision of all initial protection visa applications lodged during the period 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2005 was 83 days.</DOC>

and (3) The sum paid by the Department and agencies in the Minister's portfolio to recruitment agencies in 2005 is listed below. The payments recorded include salary and administration payments for IT contractors, non IT contractors, short term employees, placement fees and recruitment/scribe costs.Agencies generally invoice a sum total, rather than an itemised account, which is then entered into the financial system under relevant general ledger codes. This prevents the Department from being able to distinguish between salary and administration costs paid to recruitment agencies. In the example of Paxus the bulk of the figure reported comprises IT contractor salaries.

The appropriateness of the implementation of the Government's anti-terrorism laws has been considered in the context of a number of reviews into the operation of the counter-terrorism legislation that the Government has facilitated.
Security Legislation Review Committee
Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002;Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act 2002;Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Act 2002;Border Security Legislation Amendment Act 2002;Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2002; andCriminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003The other members of the Committee included:Mr Ian Carnell  -  Inspector-General of Intelligence and SecurityMs Karen Curtis  -  Privacy CommissionerDr Sev Ozdowski OAM  -  former Human Rights CommissionerProfessor John McMillan  -  Commonwealth OmbudsmanMr John A Davies APM OAM  -  former ACT Chief of PoliceMs Gillian Braddock SC  -  Law Council of AustraliaMr Dan O'Gorman  -  Law Council of AustraliaWhilst conducting its review the SLRC received 35 submissions and held public hearings in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra over February and March 2006. After extensive public consultation, the SLRC concluded that separate security legislation is necessary and noted that there was no indication of excessive or improper use of the provisions that fall within the scope of the review. The SLRC report was tabled in Parliament on 15 June 2006 and is publicly available along with the transcripts of the public hearings at www.ag.gov.au/slrc.Further, in accordance with subsection 29(1)(ba) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001, a public review of the same legislation is also being conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJC). The SLRC presented its report to the PJC on 21 April 2006 and the PJC held public hearings on 31 July 2006 and 1 August 2006. The PJC is yet to report on the findings of its review. The public submissions and transcript of the PJC hearings are publicly available at www.aph.gov.au/pjcis.
Council of Australian Governments review
There will also be a further review in 2010. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) is statutorily required to commission a review of schedules 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No 2) 2005 which include the amendment to the definition of terrorist organisation to cover organisations that advocate terrorism, preventative detention, control orders, financing of terrorism and stop, question and search powers. On 10 February 2006, COAG agreed on details concerning the scope, process and form for the review. The Council agreed that the review should be conducted by a small committee and should review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the relevant amendments in each jurisdiction. In conducting the review, the committee will have regard to the agreement of COAG leaders on 27 September 2005, in which it was agreed that any amended counter-terrorism laws must be necessary, effective against terrorism and contain appropriate safeguards against abuse, such as parliamentary and judicial review, and be exercised in a way that is evidence-based, intelligence-led and proportionate. More information regarding these measures and the review is publicly available at www.coag.gov.au.
Reporting obligations in the Criminal Code
Subsections 104.29 and 105.47 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 which were inserted into the Code by the Anti-Terrorism Act (No 2) 2005 require the Attorney-General to table a report on the operation of Division 104 (preventative detention orders) and 105 (control orders) before each House of Parliament. The report into control orders must contain the number of interim control orders made under Division 104 and particulars of any complaints made or referred to the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the Internal Investigation Division of the Australian Federal Police.The report into preventative detention orders must contain the number of initial preventative detention orders made, the number of prohibited contact orders made and the number of preventative detention orders/prohibited contact orders that a court has found not to have been validly made or declared to be void. The report for the year ending 30 June 2006 was tabled on 16 August 2006.
Other measures to ensure appropriate operation of counter-terrorism legislation
The Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security have sufficient powers to oversee the operations of the Commonwealth law enforcement and intelligence agencies. All legislation, including the anti-terrorism legislation is subject to the scrutiny of the Courts.
Commonwealth Ombudsman
The Commonwealth Ombudsman is able to investigate the actions of Federal Government departments and agencies. The Ombudsman Act 1976 provides that the Ombudsman may investigate complaints received by the Ombudsman's office or investigate on his/her own motion.In addition to this complaint investigation function, the Ombudsman's office is required under other legislation such as the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and Crimes Act 1914 to scrutinise the accuracy of records maintained by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Australian Crime Commission (ACC).The Ombudsman Act 1976 requires the Ombudsman to submit to the Minister for presentation to the Parliament, an annual report detailing the operations of the Ombudsman during the year. Further, where the Ombudsman has investigated a matter, forwarded a report to the relevant minister and is of the opinion that inadequate or inappropriate action has been taken, the Ombudsman may forward a copy of his/her report to the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives for presentation to both Houses of Parliament.Section 84 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and section 61 of the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 also requires the Ombudsman to report to the Minister in writing the results of inspections made under subsection 83(1) into the agency's records. In addition, under section 100 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and section 50 of the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 law enforcement agencies are required to prepare annual reports detailing how many applications for a warrant have been made, the number of warrants issued under each Act, particulars about the duration of the warrants and information regarding the effectiveness of the warrants. These reports are required to be tabled in Parliament each year by the Attorney-General and are made publicly available on the Attorney-General's Department's website at www.ag.gov.au/publications.
Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security
compliance by the agency with the laws of the Commonwealthcompliance by the agency with directions or guidelinesacts or practices of the agency that may be inconsistent with or contrary to any human right, that may constitute discrimination or may be unlawful under the Age Discrimination Act 2004, Racial Discrimination Act 1975 or Sex Discrimination Act 1984.The Act also authorises the Inspector-General, in certain circumstances, to inquire into action that should be taken to protect the rights of a person who is an Australian citizen.Section 35 of the IGIS Act requires the Inspector-General to prepare and furnish to the Prime Minister, an annual report of the operations of the Inspector-General. The annual report must contain the Inspector-General's comments on any inquiry conducted by the Inspector General and the extent of compliance by ASIS and DSD with rules made under section 51 of the Intelligence Services Act 2001.The Act requires the Prime Minister to provide a copy of the report to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and to lay a copy of the report before each House of Parliament.In addition to the IGIS annual report, under section 94 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act), ASIO is required to prepare a report each year which details the number of warrants issued under various Divisions of the ASIO Act, the number of hours each person appeared before a prescribed authority for questioning under the warrant and the number of hours a person spent in detention under a warrant. This report is then tabled in Parliament by the Attorney-General and a copy is also provided to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives.(2)   See reply to part (1).Documents tabled in Parliament may be accessed by members of the public via the internet on the Australian Parliament House web site at www.aph.gov.au or at the relevant department or agency's web site.(3)   In addition to my response to Question 1 and 2, my Department developed a pamphlet that outlines the key provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No 2) 2005. In January 2006, the Department arranged for 4500 copies of the pamphlet to be printed. This number included 1000 pamphlets printed in English, 500 printed in French, 500 in Vietnamese, 500 in Traditional Chinese, 500 in Spanish, 500 in Arabic, 500 in Bahasa Malay and 500 in Turkish. In addition, in July 2006 the Department ordered a further 4400 copies of the pamphlet to be printed.These pamphlets are distributed by Departmental officers at forums and seminars that Departmental officers are invited to speak at about the Australian Government's counter-terrorism legislation. Departmental offices have spoken at six forums around the country.</DOC>

and (2) I understand that Decree 8750 was issued in August last year by the Iraqi Transitional National Government, with the aim of legalising the state of union organisations in Iraq. The Decree provided for the freezing of union assets until democratic union elections to appoint a union executive were successfully held.These elections did take place, but newly elected union leaders were prevented from taking office due to legal action on the part of the former union leadership, which challenged the legality of the Decree. Iraq's Supreme Court has yet to reach a verdict on the matter. In the meantime the Iraqi Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, Mahmoud Muhammad Jawad al-Radi, has requested the Maliki Government either to cancel the Decree, or ask the Court to expedite its decision. The Australian Government continues to monitor developments; however as the issue is still before the Supreme Court, we have not made representations on Decree 8750.</DOC>

Yes.The Prime Minister's statement to the House of Representatives on 14 August 2006 (Hansard, pages 26-29) addresses the issues alluded to by the Member for O'Connor.The Government is providing $766.1 million over the years to 1 July 2014 to encourage private purchases or conversions of LPG vehicles. A tax-free grant of $2000 will be provided for private LPG conversions and $1000 for new private LPG-dedicated or dual-fuel vehicles. Taking into account revenue foregone, the total cost of this program is more than $1.3 billion over eight years.The Government provides an Ethanol Production Grant of 38.143 cents per litre on ethanol produced for use in transport applications. As of 31 July 2006, $60.2 million had been paid to producers under that program. In addition, in 2004 the Government announced Biofuels Capital Grants to three companies, CSR Distilleries, Schumer Pty Ltd and Lemon Tree Ethanol Pty Ltd, worth $12.41 million to provide new or expanded ethanol production capacity.The Government sought and gained the cooperation of the oil companies in Australia to assist in the effort to meet the target of 350 megalitres of biofuel use by 2010. The Prime Minister announced the Biofuels Action Plan, which comprises voluntary Industry Action Plans drawn up by the major oil companies, members of the Independent Petroleum Group and the major retailers, on 22 December 2005.The Government is providing $17.2 million from 1 October 2006 to enable service station operators to upgrade their equipment to increase the sale of ethanol blended fuel. The final format of the program will be concluded after a consultation process has been completed.</DOC>

 Amnesty International Website.The Government takes a considered approach to when and how it discusses the death penalty with other countries. The Government respects the sovereign right of other governments to enforce their laws but it will always make representations on behalf of Australian sentenced to the death penalty. This comes under my Department's consular responsibilities for the welfare of Australians abroad and is consistent with the abolition of the death penalty within Australian territory.Since August 2005. Australia has discussed the death penalty with a range of countries that still impose the death penalty. The issue has been discussed at Ministerial and officials level both generally and in relation to individuals. In some cases, sentences have been commuted.The Australian Government will continue to encourage those countries that impose the death penalty to commit to the principles espoused in the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</DOC>

The combined population of Iran's East and West Azerbaijan provinces (both in northern Iran) is approximately 6.5 million. Azeris, a Turkic ethnic group, make up approximately one quarter of Iran's population of 70 million and live throughout Iran.The Australian Embassy in Tehran is active in making representations to the Iranian Government urging them to respect the human rights of ethnic minorities.Australian representations to Iranian authorities have urged them to respect the rights of all ethnic minorities.In December 2005 Australia co-sponsored a United Nations General Assembly Resolution on the human rights situation in Iran. The resolution expressed serious concern at the continuing discrimination, and other human rights violations, against persons belonging to ethnic minorities and called on Iran to eliminate such practices.</DOC>

Salary Packaging At The ASC
 02 6214 1379Attachment CSBSDo you have pre-school aged children in child care?Have you thought about using the SBS Child Care Centre?The SBS Certified Agreement allows SBS employees to package their salaries. This is of real benefit to Sydney SBS employees who use the SBS Child Care Centre.What is Salary Packaging?Salary Packaging refers to an arrangement between an employer and an employee to provide some salary as a 'benefit' instead of cash. In most cases, the 'benefit' is subject to Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT), which must be met from the employee's overall remuneration. FBT is usually charged at the same rate as the top income tax rate.Child care is a 'benefit' that could be packaged and child care provided on SBS business premises for SBS employees does not attract FBT. So if an employee has a child using the SBS child care centre, their child care fees could be packaged, and no tax would be payable on these fees.This gives significant benefits to the employee.An ExampleHere is an example of a full-time employee, paid at SBS Band 3 ($45,000 pa) who has their child in care 4 days per week at the SBS Centre. The fees at the Centre are $54 per day, or $432 per fortnight in this example.Before Packagingfortnightly gross$1,725.24less tax402.00net$1,323.24less child care fees432.00net cash$891.24After Packaging Child Care Feesfortnightly gross$1,725.24less child care fees432.00new gross$1,293.24less tax266.00net cash$1,027.24In this example, the employee who packages their child care fees only pays $266.00 per fortnight tax, instead of $402.00 tax. This employee would have an extra $136.00 cash each fortnight.Another way of putting it is that packaging effectively brings the daily fees down to about $37.00 per day in this example.If you are interested in finding out how packaging child care fees would work for you, call Simon Douglas-Robertson (ext 3647) or Krystyna Chawa (ext 3657) in Human Resources to make an appointment to talk about this.SBS Child Care CentreThe SBS Child Care Centre provides high quality care for pre-school children aged from six weeks to six years. It is open between 8am and 7pm, Monday to Friday. All meals are provided for the children.The Centre is run by experienced staff who are qualified in child care. Its aim is to provide a caring and educational environment for the children.Please contact the Centre Director on extension 3189 to make an appointment to visit the Centre. Alison Lamaro can also assist if you would like to talk to another parent who is already using the Centre.</DOC>

The NH90 is not yet in service with any country. Germany will accept its first aircraft on 8 September 2006 and will be the first nation to operate a qualified NH90 variant.Even in August of 2004, when the Commonwealth decided to procure the Tactical Transport Helicopter version of the NH90, developmental work was complete. At that time, over 2,500 hours of test flying had been completed with five prototypes. By the end of 2004, NH90 were in production.As indicated by Brigadier Patch on 31 May 2006 at the Senate Legislation Committee, we are buying an aircraft that is being purchased at this stage by 14 other nations. Our first aircraft will be the 51st off the production line. To date, Germany, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Greece have received NH90 aircraft and commenced either aircraft acceptance testing or operational test and evaluation. Twelve of the German aircraft will be delivered and operational before the first NH90 is delivered to Australia in December 2007.</DOC>

Operation ASTUTE has been classified non-warlike following an assessment of both the military and environmental threats to Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel in Timor-Leste. Non-warlike operations can encompass duties exposing individuals or units to a degree of hazard above and beyond that of normal peace-time duties.Unlike previous ADF involvement in East Timor, there is no identified threat of deliberate targeting of ADF personnel by factional groups, gangs or individuals. Should the threat change, an immediate nature of service review will be conducted.</DOC>

For the period since 1996, the table at Attachment A lists each type of temporary entrant visa currently issued by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA), including a description of each visa's conditions and purpose, together with the number issued.For the period since 1996, the table at Attachment B lists each type of temporary entrant visa no longer issued by DIMA, including a description of each visa's conditions and purpose, together with the number issued.Note: Visa conditions are listed by number. Attachment C provides a list of all visa conditions by number.Yes. DIMA records the names of individuals issued temporary entrant visas on a number of computer systems.Currently, the names of temporary visa applicants and the details of their visas are found on the Department's Integrated Client Services Environment (ICSE), Immigration Records Information System (IRIS) and Electronic Travel Authority System (ETAS)  -  depending on the applicant's circumstances.The names of all individuals granted visas are also loaded onto the Department's Travel &amp; Immigration Processing System (TRIPS) which includes the Movements database. Data from TRIPS is also uploaded into other systems such as Advanced Passenger Processing System (APPS) and ETAS.The Department also keeps paper file records on some temporary visa holders. Some records of visas issued before 1990 are also available on microfiche and some related electronic documents are stored on the Department's Total Records Information Management (TRIM) system.The records available on different departmental systems commence at different times. ICSE records date back to 1998 and IRIS records date back to late 1981.Automated data on temporary visa holders is available on TRIPS from 1990 onwards. Earlier data is available, however, drawing on data entered manually from passenger cards.Paper records on temporary visa holders have been created by the Department since its inception. Since 1999, these records have been registered on the Department's TRIM system.All records held by the Department on temporary visa holders, whether paper or electronic, are managed in accordance with the Archives Act 1983 and are subject to related legislation such as the Privacy Act 1988, the Evidence Act 1995 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982.Onshore applications for temporary visas are destroyed two years after departure of the visa holder is confirmed.The majority of offshore applications for temporary visas are destroyed two years after the relevant period of temporary entrance has ended or a decision has been made to refuse the application. Some tourist visa applications are, however, destroyed immediately after approval or within six months of the decision to refuse the application.Electronic departmental records on temporary visa holders are retained indefinitely.Other details of visa holders recorded by the Department vary. At a minimum, departmental computer systems record basic biographical data, including a visa holder's date of birth, country of birth, sex, marital status, passport number, country of passport and date of passport grant.More detailed information about visa holders is, however, often available, particularly on ICSE and IRIS, depending on the nature of the case and the information provided to the Department during the visa application process. For example, IRIS case notes could contain details about the visa holder's family composition, financial status, study commitments and employment status.Departmental paper records similarly contain any details of the visa holder included in the relevant visa application, any supporting documentation provided and any written correspondence between the visa holder and the relevant departmental officer.Attachment ALIST OF TEMPORARY ENTRANT VISAS CURRENTLY ISSUED BY SUBCLASS* Visa grant numbers below 1000 have been rounded to the nearest 10.

I have been advised of Telstra's Payphone Rationalisation Program which proposes to reduce the number of payphones by approximately 5,000. There are currently more than 60,000 payphones in Australia.Yes. The Government accepted in full or part 31 of 33 recommendations of the Payphone Policy Review Report, which are aimed at improving service levels, in recognition of the clear social requirements for payphones for people needing to make emergency calls, people without access to a phone at home, young people and low income earners. Telstra's Standard Marketing Plan (SMP) was amended as a result of the recommendations of the report to include a payphone siting criteria to accommodate the needs of people without access to a phone.Yes, and the Government agreed with the Inquiry's finding that the previous approach required improvements, including amending Telstra's SMP to implement recommendations of the Payphone Policy Review Report. The report was published in 2004 and Telstra's SMP has been amended to implement recommendations of the report. Furthermore, on 8 June 2006, I announced a package of payphone initiatives that Telstra is now implementing. One of these initiatives involves a commitment from Telstra to further amend its SMP to give a clearer description of what constitutes having 'reasonable access' to a payphone.Telstra, as the primary universal service provider, is required by the Universal Service Obligation (USO) to make payphones reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra's SMP sets out the circumstances in which Telstra can remove payphones. ACMA's role is to approve and monitor Telstra's compliance with the SMP. This means that Telstra is unable to remove payphones that it is obliged to maintain under the USO, including those in the electoral division of Lowe.As primary universal service provider, Telstra has a legal obligation under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra's SMP describes how it will provide payphones under USO.No. The Government has already exercised its powers under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standard) Act 1999 to legally require Telstra to ensure that payphones reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. The package of initiatives I announced on 8 June 2006 will provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra's processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in its compliance role. ACMA will now have a more active role in monitoring Telstra's compliance with the USO and investigating payphone removals. ACMA will have dedicated staff on hand to fulfil its new complaints handling responsibility. Every Telstra payphone removal or relocation notice will also notify payphone users of ACMA's role in handling complaints. ACMA has broad powers to take remedial action if it considers that Telstra has breached its Universal Service Obligations.No. There are already enforceable mandatory requirements on Telstra to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business under the USO.</DOC>

A United States legislative prohibition has been placed on the overseas sale of the F-22A since approval of the Financial Year 1998 United States Defense Appropriation Bill. Australia has never formally sought release for sale of the F-22A. Ongoing assessment continues to reaffirm the Defence assessment that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will mature to most cost-effectively meet Australia's future air combat capability requirements.Australia joined the System Development and Demonstration phase of the JSF Program in 2002 after consideration of the full-range of aircraft available for Project AIR 6000. Ongoing detailed Defence analysis reaffirms this decision and the Government remains confident that the stealthy, fifth generation, multi - role JSF will mature to meet Australia's air combat capability requirements in the most cost-effective way.While there has been press reports suggesting that Japan may be considering pursuing an F - 22A acquisition, the Government can not confirm if such an action is being formally pursued.</DOC>

The F-22A is currently facing obsolescence issues in relation to its avionics and sensor suite.These obsolescence issues are being addressed now.The Joint Strike Fighter Program will avoid obsolescence issues through a number of strategies:An open systems approach has been adopted for both hardware and software to ensure new systems can be readily accommodated.JSF sustainment will be managed through a performance based logistics approach in which responsibility for addressing obsolescence issues will rest with Lockheed Martin and the subsidiary original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).The linking of production and sustainment of components with OEMs provides surety of business to the OEMs.The JSF global fleet will be of sufficient size (compared to the F-22) to make the demand for replacement and repair of parts sufficiently high to make viable continued OEM investment into product improvement and continuity of supply.The JSF follow-on development program will include a scheduled minor upgrade every two to four years, providing an opportunity to pre - empt obsolescence issues.A key factor for assuring uninterrupted production and sustainment of the JSF Air System will be process-driven and proactive mitigation of the effects of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), which is defined as the loss, or impending loss, of manufacturers of items or suppliers of items or raw materials that support the F-35 JSF Program. In order to accomplish this, the F-35 JSF Program will institute a proactive, technology management process with the objective of protecting aircraft manufacturing, deliveries, and sustainment by ensuring that DMSMS does not preclude the availability of sufficient materials and/or parts-on-hand.</DOC>

The Government recently announced its response to the Report of the Taskforce on Reducing the Regulatory Burdens on Business (Banks Report). Some of the benefits from the Government's response have already begun flowing through to small business and other changes which will directly benefit small business have already been locked into the Government's agenda. The benefits which have or will flow to the business community include:Halving of the incorporation fee from $800 to $400 effective from 1 July 2006;On 31 August 2006 I launched the New to Business Checklist which helps people starting or buying a business to understand the steps involved and tells them where to look for more information;Introduction of a simplified GST accounting method for small restaurants, café and caterers streamlining GST obligations and compliance costs from 1 October 2006;An increase in the minor fringe benefits exemption threshold from $100 to $300, effective from 1 April 2007;An increase in the fringe benefits reporting exclusion threshold from $1000 to $2000, effective from 1 April 2007;Streamlined business name and ABN registration processes and making improved information available to businesses is being undertaken through COAG;Enhancing www.business.gov.au at a cost of $29.6 million over three years to implement the use of electronic signatures so that electronic forms can be verified; andAnnouncing the review of the Privacy Act 1988 by the Australian Law Reform Commission to consider, among other things, the impact of privacy requirement on business compliance costs.Benefits to the business community from the $50 million Regulation Reduction Incentive Fund (RRIF) are already evident. Although projects under the competitive grants component of the RRIF are still at an early stage, the demonstration projects have been completed and the results are outlined on the Australian Government business website business.gov.au. The RRIF has also provided a catalyst for councils to work together on the standardisation and rationalisation of regulatory compliance processes across local government regions and state boundaries. Details of the projects funded in the competitive grant component of the RRIF can be found on the AusIndustry website, www.ausindustry.gov.au.</DOC>

From June 2004 to May 2006, the delay from graduation to operational conversion has taken, on average, four months. Averages from each Force Element Group are:Air Lift Group  -  6.1 months;Surveillance and Response Group  -  3.9 months;Air Combat Group  -  2.4 months; andRoyal Australian Navy  -  3.5 months.From June 2004 to May 2006, 45 per cent of Air Force graduates attended the Intermediate Flying Scheme (IFS), which is designed to keep graduate skills proficient on PC9 aircraft while waiting for operational conversion. The IFS is conducted at 2 Flight Training School with an average time of 6.5 months (longest period 14 months). The remaining 55 per cent either commenced operational conversion training or were gainfully employed on work experience, further training (non flying), or commenced work at their units as Operations Officers. On completion of the RAAF Advanced Pilot course at Pearce, Navy pilots conduct Pilot Basic Rotary Course conversion at HMAS Albatross (723 Squadron).Some Air Force pilots have required re-currency flying before commencing operational conversion. This is not re-training and has not occurred in the past 12 months. No newly qualified Navy pilots have required re-training at Pearce.Members who have experienced delays in commencing operational conversion courses have performed to the required standard without any appreciable increase in training effort. There have been no removals from conversion training due to delays in commencement of that training.</DOC>

Unlike other exit programmes administered by the Australian Government, such as Farm Help, the re-establishment grant component of the Sugar Industry Reform Programme 2004 provides assistance to those farmers who may not wish to sell their farm but would still like to exit the sugar industry. As a result, cane growers are also able to access the grant, albeit on a taxable basis, if they exit the sugar industry either by leasing their land or diversifying into another agricultural operation. This is not possible under other exit programmes.Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant. This is the same treatment that applies to farmers who exit agriculture altogether under the Farm Help programme.However, re-establishment grants for the sugar industry operate with the most flexible assets test of any similar arrangement and provide the highest grant payment of $100,000 compared with $50,000 under the Farm Help programme.Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant, consistent with the provisions of other exit programmes such as Farm Help. The fact that growers who exit the sugar industry by diversification into another agricultural operation or by leasing their farm can also obtain assistance, albeit on a taxable basis, is a significant additional benefit compared to those farmers who exit other agricultural industries under similar programmes.Re-establishment grants for the sugar industry also operate with the most flexible assets test, and the highest grant payment, of any similar arrangement.The Government is not in a position to provide additional concessions under the programme.Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant, consistent with the provisions of other exit programmes such as Farm Help.However, the re-establishment grant component of the Sugar Industry Reform Programme 2004 also recognises the importance of helping farmers to move to another agricultural operation and still qualify for a grant. Providing a taxable grant in these cases maintains the objective of the programme and also provides additional assistance for those farmers in the most severe financial difficulties to establish themselves outside the sugar industry. This is consistent with the treatment of grants to individual farmers under other schemes, which are normally taxable unless specified otherwise under relevant legislation.The provision of tax free grants to farmers who exit agriculture altogether also recognises that they are highly unlikely to return to the sugar industry, as may occur with many who exit through leasing or diversification.</DOC>

When a company is being liquidated because it is insolvent, proofs of debt are lodged with the liquidator and the task of determining who is a creditor falls to the liquidator of the company, not the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. A liquidator may accept or reject a proof of debt, in whole or in part. A creditor dissatisfied with a decision by a liquidator to reject all or part of a claim may appeal to a court. Ultimately the question of who is a creditor is a question of fact and law to be determined by a court. Where superannuation contributions are owed to an employee, the employee can lodge a proof of debt for the unpaid contributions. Where the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has determined the employer has a superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) liability, the ATO can also lodge a proof of debt in respect of that SGC liability. The Government has announced that it proposes to clarify the status and priority of the SGC in insolvency. Amendments will ensure that SGC attracts the highest priority, along with wages and superannuation, that employee entitlements enjoy under the law. It is expected that the Government will be releasing draft amendments for public comment later in 2006.</DOC>

A list of agencies that are used by ANSTO on a preferred supplier basis follows.Southside Staffing Services, Commercial Design Consolidated (NSW), Southtech Personnel, ETM Placements, Mantech International Systems Recruitment, Hays, TMP/HudsonAIATSIS, Questacon and the Australian Research Council did not use recruitment agencies in 2004-05.</DOC>

Mr Eddie Watkin, Learn 2 Lead
9 Pimelea Street Everton Hills, Queensland 4053
To inform the Commission's evaluation of agency approaches to attraction and retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees a number of focus groups (37) were conducted with staff from other APS agencies. The majority of these focus groups were conducted by Commission employees.
The Commission engaged the services of Mr Eddie Watkin, Learn 2 Lead, to assist with facilitation of 15 of the aforementioned focus groups at a total cost of $5465.55. The Commission also met the cost of travel, up to the value of a standard return economy airfare from Brisbane to the relevant location and associated transfer costs. These focus groups were conducted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander APS employees and were held in a variety of locations across Australia (Darwin, Canberra, Townsville, Brisbane and Sydney).

As part of the survey development process, a focus group was conducted for the purpose of testing the survey instrument.

At the invitation of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs three experienced officers in identity verification from the Exit/Entry Administration of the Ministry of Public Security (People's Republic of China) interviewed detainees to assist in establishing the nationality of detainees believed to be Chinese nationals.Detainees were asked about various matters including their place and date of birth, their family composition, and their education and employment background.In all but two cases persons who met with the delegation had no outstanding matters with either the Department, at merits review, or with the courts. In the case of one individual who was interviewed and who did have judicial proceedings underway, the Minister was subsequently advised of this and decided to intervene and grant the person a visa.In the other case an interview was commenced, but terminated after the individual asked to speak to an immigration officer, explained that he had litigation ongoing, and showed the officer a piece of paper referring to the Federal Court. The detainee was requested to return to his room and the officer informed the PRC delegation that he was not to be interviewed. The PRC delegation handed back the bio-data details. DIMA has examined the relevant transcript and does not consider that the individual's short exchange with the delegation raises protection issues.</DOC>

1 Job Network is a national service administered by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) and is available for indigenous and non-indigenous people Job Network expenditure includes Job Network Service, Job Placement, New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, Harvest Labour Services, National Harvest Labour Information Service and the Employment Innovation Fund.
 Structured Training and Employment Projects, Wage Assistance, Community Development Employment Project Placement Incentive, Indigenous Employment Centres and National Indigenous Cadetship Project. We cannot quantify the assistance in the same way for the remaining IEP programme element, i.e. 'Other' programmes.
3 Potentially all Indigenous Australians are eligible to be assisted through IEP  -  these figures only quantify those assisted.
4 Indigenous Employment Centres (IEC) services are contracted through a competitive purchasing process. A single organisation is contracted to deliver IEC services in the electorate of Chifley. For reasons of commercial sensitivity details of contracted funding for this individual provider of Australian Government Employment Services is not identified.
5 'Other' programme elements of the IEP include the Indigenous Small Business Fund, the Emerging Indigenous Entrepreneurs Initiative, Indigenous Community Volunteers, the Indigenous Capital Assistance Scheme, Indigenous Youth Employment Consultants, Public Awareness initiatives and the Aboriginal Employment Strategy.
6 'Other' programme elements of the IEP do not have information readily available at a Federal electorate level.
7 There is only one funded organisation in the electoral division of Chifley. Funding for each CDEP organisation is negotiated on an individual basis and cannot be identified for commercial-in-confidence reasons.
8 Includes all commencements in the TtW programme during 2005-06. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
9 The TtW Programme is open to all eligible job seekers, targeting parents, carers and those of mature age. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
10 Includes all commencements in Vocational Rehabilitation during 2004-05. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
11 Includes all commencements in JPET during 2004-05. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
12 PSP does not have a target number of people to be assisted each year. This table reflects the actual number of people assisted. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
13 Does not include expenditure for assessments undertaken post 30 June, related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006. Projected total expenditure is $24.4m.
14 Approximate cost based on contracted cost of face-to-face assessment for referrals from Centrelink's Blacktown, Mt Druitt and St Mary's Customer Services Centres. This does not include the cost of assessments to be undertaken post 30 June related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006.
15 Better Assessment is a demand driven programme. During 2005-06 approximately 111,353 people underwent a Better Assessment. This figure does not include assessments to be completed post 30 June, related to referrals up to and including 30 June 2006.
16 Reflects the number of completed assessments following referral from Centrelink's Blacktown, Mt Druitt and St Mary's Customer Service Centres. This figure may increase following the completion of assessments in July and August 2006 for referrals made up to and including 30 June 2006.
17 Disability Employment Network (DEN) figures include jobseeker numbers only. Workers that are being supported by DEN members are not included. Some of these job seekers may be Indigenous.
18 Expenditure in the electoral division of Chifley is not available because IBA data collection is aligned to the former ATSIC regional council areas, not electoral regions.

The decision to increase the private health insurance rebate for people aged over 65 years was made to provide assistance to older Australians by reducing the costs of premiums and to help them retain their private health insurance at a time in their lives that they most need it.The government does not plan to extend the increased private health insurance rebate to members under the age of 65. However, all Australians under the age of 65 will continue to receive the 30% rebate.</DOC>

I am aware of an article in the Sun-Herald on 22 January 2006 on revenue from SACL commercial trading.Yes. Under Treasurer's Direction No. 27 and pursuant to Part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is responsible for monitoring the prices, costs and profits of a range of aeronautical and aeronautical related services at the seven major airports.The ACCC's 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 price monitoring reports provide details of each major airport's car parking rates. Details of these reports can be obtained via ACCC's website  -  www.accc.gov.au.The ACCC's 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 price monitoring reports do not provide the specific information to answer this question. However, analysis of the car parking prices obtained from SACL's website (www.sydneyairport.com.au) available from 2003, indicates that car parking rates in total have increased by less than CPI since privatisation and in many cases have remained at the same rates or have been reduced.No. Given ACCC's responsibility for investigating pricing complaints under the Trade Practices Act 1974, any complaints about the level of charges would be a matter for the ACCC to consider in the first instance.Moreover, the Productivity Commission is currently considering a wide range of issues as part of its Inquiry into Price Regulation of Airport Services. In particular, the Productivity commission will examine whether airports including SACL have acted in a manner consistent with the Government's Aeronautical Pricing Principles released in its response to the Productivity Commission's 2002 Report on Airport Price Regulations. The Government will consider the Commission's recommendations following receipt of the Commission's final report.</DOC>

The visits have identified areas in which the Government of Indonesia is likely to be interested in longer term exchanges and PM&amp;C is working with Setneg and Setkab to identify the scope for specific further exchange activities in areas of mutual interest.</DOC>

Prior to 26 February 2001 New Zealand citizens entering Australia under the Trans Tasman Travel Arrangements held temporary visas but were, for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (the Act), treated as permanent residents under the auspices of an Instrument issued under the Act.In support of the new bilateral social security arrangements between Australia and New Zealand, a new Instrument was issued under the Act with the effect that New Zealand citizens entering Australia under those new arrangements are not treated as permanent residents for citizenship purposes.New Zealand citizens continue to be regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Act if they:were present in Australia on 26 February 2001; orhad been in Australia for at least 12 months in the two years immediately before 26 February 2001 and returned to Australia after that day; orwere residing in Australia on 26 February 2001 but were temporarily absent; orcommenced or recommenced residing in Australia by 26 May 2001.Applications could be made to Centrelink to obtain a certificate stating that either (c) or (d) was applicable. The certificates for those New Zealand citizens in category (c) were issued until 26 February 2002 if the person was not a recipient of a Centrelink payment. If the person was a recipient of a Centrelink payment, the person was required to return to Australia by 26 August 2001. For those New Zealand citizens in category (d) certificates were issued until 26 February 2004.If New Zealand citizens do not come within the above categories they are not regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Act and must hold a permanent visa issued under the Migration Act 1958 to be eligible for Australian citizenship.
 
were present in Australia on 26 February 2001; orhad been in Australia for at least 12 months in the two years immediately before 26 February 2001 and returned to Australia after that day; orwere residing in Australia on 26 February 2001 but were temporarily absent; orcommenced or recommenced residing in Australia by 26 May 2001.As indicated at (3) above, the changes were widely publicised. However it has become evident that there are a very small number of New Zealand citizens who were likely to be eligible for, but did not obtain a certificate from Centrelink.As indicated in response to (2) above, New Zealand citizens had no entitlement to Australian citizenship, but prior to 26 February 2001 were regarded as permanent residents for the purposes of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. New Zealand citizens who did not obtain a certificate from Centrelink prior to 26 February 2004 must obtain an Australian permanent residence visa if they wish to be eligible for Australian citizenship.</DOC>

Special Category Visas (SCVs) are only granted to New Zealand citizens.New Zealand citizens who were in Australia on 26 February 2001 and held a Special Category Visa (SCV) are classified as 'eligible New Zealand citizens' not 'permanent residents'. An 'eligible New Zealand citizen' is able to apply for Australian citizenship, sponsor relatives for Australian permanent residence and access certain Social Security payments. The definition of 'eligible New Zealand citizen' came into effect on 27 February 2001 (further revised on 1 July 2001).Not all New Zealand citizens who were absent from Australia on 26 February 2001 were affected by the changes announced by the Australian Government. New Zealand citizens who were outside Australia on 26 February 2001, but were in Australia and held a Special Category Visa for at least 1 year in the 2 years prior to that date; or had been issued with a Centrelink certificate prior to 26 February 2004 stating they were residing in Australia on a particular date were not affected. These Special Category Visa holders were, and still are, able to apply for Australian citizenship, sponsor relatives for Australian permanent residence and access certain Social Security payments. These transitional arrangements were intended such that New Zealand citizens who were temporarily outside of Australia were not disadvantaged and retained the benefits of the pre-February 2001 arrangements.The overall outcome of the changes announced by the Australian Government on 26 February 2001 was that most New Zealand citizens arriving in Australia after 27 February 2001 are required to obtain an Australian permanent residence visa if they wish to access certain social security payments, be eligible for Australian citizenship or sponsor people for Australian permanent residence.New Zealand citizens are still permitted to travel to, live and work indefinitely in Australia under terms of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangements while the holders of Special Category visas.'Non-Protected' Special Category visa holders is not a term used under the Migration Act 1948 or Migration Regulations. New Zealand citizens who met the transitional provisions and therefore were not affected by the changes introduced on 26 February 2001 are classified as 'Eligible New Zealand citizens'. As detailed in (3) above, transitional arrangements were put in place so people who had been recent long-term residents but were temporarily outside Australia on 26 February 2001 would not be disadvantaged.Australian permanent residents who depart Australia and wish to return, are required to obtain a Resident Return Visa (RRV). To be granted an RRV, the applicant must be:a permanent resident holding a valid permanent visa (if they are in Australia),a former permanent resident whose last permanent visa was not cancelled, ora former Australian citizen who has lost or renounced their Australian citizenship.In addition to the above, to be eligible for the grant of a five year RRV, the applicant must:have been lawfully present in Australia for a total of at least two years in the five years immediately before lodging the application for the visa, orhave substantial and beneficial business, cultural, employment or personal ties to Australia and compelling reasons for having been absent from Australia for more than five years, orbe a member of the family unit of a person who holds a valid RRV or who has applied for and met the criteria for an RRV.Persons who do not meet the above criteria, but are required to leave Australia for compassionate and compelling reasons, may be eligible for a three month RRV.Former permanent residents, who are unable to meet the criteria for an RRV, and wish to return and live in Australia are required to apply for and be granted, a migrant visa.(6)   Yes.(7)   I am aware of General Recommendation 30 of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.(8)   A media release from the Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs dated 26 February 2001 stated in part:'The new arrangements have been introduced with the express purpose of implementing the new social security agreement and apply to all New Zealand citizens, regardless of place of birth. It provides a more equitable base for the free flow of people between each country.'(9)   Yes. The new Instrument issued under the Act, which gave effect to the requirement that New Zealand citizens entering Australia under those new arrangements are not treated as permanent residents for citizenship purposes, was required to support the new bilateral social security arrangements(10) Yes.(11) The Combined Thirteenth and Fourteenth Periodic Report of the Government of Australia under Article 9 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination 1966, was presented to the Committee on 25 November 2003 and covered the reporting period 1998 to 2002. It was also tabled in Parliament on the same day. The report referred to some changes to the citizenship legislation but did not specifically refer to the changes affecting New Zealand citizens as these changes were not considered to come within the ambit of the Convention (as per the answer to question 12).(12) The Office of International Law in the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the legislative changes which were introduced in 2001 to implement a social security agreement between New Zealand and Australia do not breach the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Further, the changes do not constitute racial discrimination for the purposes of CERD.Article 1(1) of CERD provides that:'the term 'racial discrimination' shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life'.The changes do not constitute racial discrimination against New Zealanders, because there is now no distinction applied in relation to social security access between New Zealanders and other nationalities that arrive in Australia as migrants. Previously New Zealanders received preferential treatment, and any withdrawing of that treatment is not discrimination, but merely places New Zealanders on an equal footing with people of other nationalities.</DOC>

Any surplus from the ticket levy will be used for the benefit of aviation and the tourism sector, including a commitment to improve security for regional airports. The amount of surplus is yet to be determined but is nowhere near the $200 million that has been reported.Any distribution by the Administrators reflects the legal obligation of the Administrator to distribute funds in accordance with s556 of the Corporations Act. The Government will not be fully repaid by the Ansett Administrators, unless all former employees are also paid any outstanding redundancy entitlements over and above SEESA.</DOC>

Yes. Defence facilitates access to childcare for Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and Defence Australian Public Service (APS) employees through the Defence Child Care Program., (ii) and (iii) The Defence Child Care Program offers access to long day care, family day care, and outside school hours care. Under separate programs, Defence Force families may also have access to respite care for families with recognised special needs, occasional care or, in some cases, to emergency support when the Defence Force member is serving away from home, which may include child care if required. Some Defence Groups also operate holiday programs for the children of APS employees.The Defence Child Care Program includes 41 long day care centres, including 14 centres on or adjacent to military bases, and three sites that are yet to commence operation. Defence Force members and APS employees may also apply to utilise three other Commonwealth sponsored centres in the Australian Capital Territory. All centres are considered to be located at Defence or Commonwealth Government business premises. Defence's 38 operational centres currently provide a total of 2,633 long day care places.and (iii) Non-Defence families may use Defence centres where spare capacity exists. Preference is given to Defence Force and Defence APS families under discrete priority of access guidelines, which cater for the mobile Defence lifestyle. When a community-based family enrols in a Defence child care centre, they are made aware of the priority of access guidelines that operate in that centre and are alerted that they may be given notice to vacate their place for use by a Defence family.Child care related information for members and employees, including the locations and capacity of each centre and a copy of the Defence priority of access guidelines, are available on the Defence Community Organisation website at:Yes. The option to salary sacrifice is available in the 19 Defence child care centres, which constituted the Defence Child Care Program as at 30 June 2005 and at the three ACT centres indicated in part (2)(b)(i). It is not available at the additional Defence Corporate Centres brought into the Program since that time.and (5) As at 30 June 2006, 342 ADF members and 82 APS employees were salary sacrificing for child care expenses, all of whom were using one of the 19 centres or the three ACT centres mentioned in part (3).No.Yes. The published 2006-2009 Defence Collective Agreement, which covers APS employees, is available on the Defence website at:www.defence.gov.au/dpe/dwr/Defence Force families may have access to financial assistance for childcare related to respite care for families with recognised special needs, occasional care or, in some cases, to emergency support in the absence of the Defence Force member. The Family Support Funding Program also provides financial assistance to community group committees for child care during formal committee meetings. For APS employees, occasional care and holiday programs are available at some sites.Defence submitted an application for a private ruling for salary sacrifice to apply to the new Defence Corporate Centres coming within the Defence Child Care Program since 1 July 2005. This application was made to the Australian Taxation Office on 3 February 2006.Yes.</DOC>

Yes. Each year the ATO investigates approximately 13,000 complaints, either by phone or correspondence, from employees who believe their employer has not fulfilled their superannuation guarantee obligations. The ATO investigates all complaints.The length of time a complaint takes to finalise may be shorter or longer depending on a range of factors including the number of employees, the number of periods that are being investigated, the quality of information that is given by the complainant and the responsiveness of the employer to our inquiries. Many complaints are made after the employee has left the employer and debt recovery action can also be difficult.As part of the Federal Government's 2006-07 Budget Measures, the ATO was funded an additional $19.2 million over four years to improve responsiveness to taxpayer inquiries. The aim of the measure is two-fold: to support greater disclosure to employees about the progress of investigations into their complaint and to reduce the backlog of inquiries and provide more timely completion of future investigations.to (c) The Commissioner has advised me that he is unable to provide data on employee complaints about unpaid superannuation by electoral division.</DOC>

Yes. Motor Neurone Disease is an uncommon degenerative disorder that occurs at similar rates in most countries of the world. The Australian Motor Neurone Disease Association of Australia estimates that there are presently about 1,400 people in Australia with Motor Neurone Disease.Sufferers of Motor Neurone Disease may be eligible for Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) funded services.This is not the case.To be eligible for CSTDA services the disability must have manifested before the age of 65.However, there are various Commonwealth Government programs which offer in-home accommodation support to people over 65 suffering from chronic disease, such as Motor Neurone Disease, and their carers, such as the Home and Community Care Program (HACC) and Community Aged Packaged Care Programs.HACC provides for services that assist frail elderly Australians, those with a disability and their carers to remain living independently. Whilst people with Motor Neurone Disease may be eligible to receive HACC services, eligibility is not solely assessed on having such an illness. Eligibility for HACC services is based on the frailty of the individual related to their disability, and the individual's need for assistance due to their moderate, severe or profound disability.Community Aged Packaged Care Programs are designed to meet the needs of frail older people, generally aged 70 years and older (or 50 years and older for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples), who have a preference to remain living in the community, and are able to do so with the assistance of a package of care.Yes. The average age of onset of the disease is 50 years.This is not correct. As outlined above, there are various Commonwealth Government programs which offer services and support to people diagnosed with Motor Neurone Desease after the age of 65, and their carers.The Commonwealth Government already provides funding to ensure that all people with a disability, including those with Motor Neurone Disease receive services that meet their specific needs. This is done through HACC and Community Aged Packaged Care Programs and by working with state and territory governments to meet the needs of people with disability, their families and carers. The Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) provides the national framework for the provision of government support to services for people with disability.The state and territory governments continue to be responsible for services for people with a disability. Over the five years of the current CSTDA, the Commonwealth Government will provide state and territory governments with more than $2.8 billion to assist them to meet their agreed responsibilities.</DOC>

The Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council ('the Council') endorsed a set of Objectives and Principles to Guide Future NRM Programmes at its tenth meeting, on 21 April 2006. These objectives and principles provide guidance to Australian Government Ministers, and their State and Territory colleagues, in their consideration of possible future natural resource management arrangements. However, the objectives and principles do not represent the final view of any government on these arrangements.A copy of the objectives and principles is attached.The climate change priorities and draft initial actions for 2006-08 were also endorsed by the Council in April 2006. These priorities and actions were reflected in the National Agriculture and Climate Change Action Plan 2006-2009, which was published in August 2006, and is available on the Internet at:http://www.daff.gov.au/content/output.cfm?ObjectID=163EC4D8-6CD3-48F8-8954C0BAD154C28&amp;contType=outputs.A copy of the Action Plan has been provided to the honourable member and a copy is also available from the Table Office.
ATTACHMENT A
Objectives and Principles to Guide Future Natural Resource Management ProgramsThe current funding arrangements for the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality will conclude in June 2008. As a part of our continuous improvement approach, the Australian and State and Territory governments are considering arrangements for any future natural resource management programs. To ensure we build on the strengths of the partnership model, a Working Group of officials from State, Territory and Australian Governments, and the Australian Local Government Association, have developed the following set of principles and objectives to guide the development of future NRM. These principles and objectives are designed to establish broadly indicative but useful guidelines rather than to establish prescriptive 'rules' for future NRM arrangements.
Principles
Maximising investment return, especially in relation to demonstrable, positive and strategic NRM outcomes;Recognising that it is more cost-effective to prevent damage than repair it;A program architecture that addresses strategic NRM concerns in an integrated manner and that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate regional variability; andIdentifying, protecting and rehabilitating high value NRM assets; andAddressing areas of high and emerging demand for NRM action (such as climate change and urban and peri-urban issues); andThe establishment of decision-making processes and structures that are informed by the best available scientific and socio-economic information and advice, and that provide for the timely review of this information and advice.
Objectives
The establishment of cost-sharing arrangements that take account of the interests of, and benefits flowing to, all parties;Continued support for a regional investment element that effectively integrates regional, multi-regional, State and national NRM objectives;The establishment of mechanisms to address cross-regional issues, recognising that there are practical limits on the extent to which individual regions can contribute to extra-regional outcomes;Encouraging integrated landscape management, including through removal of barriers to investment in strategic NRM priorities;The development of arrangements that provide for the maximum practicable community engagement in NRM;The development of arrangements that encourage industry, including primary industry, to be involved in private investment in NRM in partnership with all levels of government;The development of arrangements to further engage and encourage participation of Indigenous communities in NRM programs;The development of arrangements that draw on the operational experience of current and previous NRM models.</DOC>

The Australian Government does not compile data on total Commonwealth expenditure on property and services procurement but does have in place a centralised reporting system for departments and agencies to report the value of awarded procurement contracts.Prior to 1 January 2005, all departments and agencies governed by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 were required to report procurement contracts and standing offers with a value of $2,000 or more on the Government's Gazette Publishing System. This requirement applied to all contracts except those exempt from notification by the Chief Executive of an agency under the Freedom of Information Act 1982.Following the issue of new Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines ('the CPGs') taking effect from 1 January 2005, the reporting requirements were changed to cover contracts and standing offers with a value of $10,000 or more (in place of $2,000 or more). In addition, the reporting requirement was extended to cover certain contracts and standing offers of those agencies governed under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 that are also required to apply the CPGs in respect of certain procurements as set out in the Finance Minister's (CAC Act Procurement) Directions.The Gazette Publishing System has now been incorporated into the Australian Government's AusTender system.The following table presents a summary of the value of contracts reported by departments and agencies for the years 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05.Year Industry Sector1

This recognises the complexity and substantial administrative burden that would ensue from attempting to collect such information. However, it is possible, through the www.contracts.gov.au website for an enquirer to identify relevant suppliers for individual reported contracts.</DOC>

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) provides for the protection of matters of national environmental significance, including listed threatened species. The Golden Sun Moth (synemon plana) is listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act. New proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on any matter of national environmental significance must be referred for consideration under the EPBC Act, and cannot proceed without approval.As a nationally listed threatened species, the Golden Sun Moth is required to have a recovery plan in place under the EPBC Act. A recovery plan sets out the actions necessary to protect the species and reduce threats. While there is no national recovery plan currently in force for the Golden Sun Moth, a national plan is being prepared by the New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation. I am advised that a draft of the plan is at an advanced stage of development.Serrated Tussock (Nasella trichotoma) is a Weed of National Significance in Australia. The responsibility for the management of Serrated Tussock ultimately rests with individual landowners and land managers, with state and territory governments having overall legislative and administrative responsibility. Weeds of National Significance such as Serrated Tussock, however, are considered of national importance and require national coordinated effort amongst all levels of government. For each of the Weeds of National Significance a national strategic plan has been developed that outlines strategies and actions required to control the weed, including identifying responsibilities for each action.The Australian Government contributes half the funding for a Serrated Tussock management coordinator who, in conjunction with a National Serrated Tussock Management Group, oversees the implementation of the goals and actions of the Serrated Tussock Strategic Plan, including the coordination of priority actions.The Australian Government has also funded the development of a Serrated Tussock Weed Management Guide to aid land managers in their efforts to control Serrated Tussock.My Department was contacted by Broadcast Australia on 20 December 2005. Broadcast Australia sought advice about their property management obligations having regard to the recent discovery of a significant population of the Golden Sun Moth on their St Albans site and the need to undertake urgent fuel reduction measures. The Department agreed with measures proposed by Broadcast Australia to reduce the potential fire hazard of the site whilst ensuring that there would not be a significant impact on the Golden Sun Moth. Broadcast Australia, as the responsible land manager for the site, has since completed, and is implementing, a vegetation management plan to ensure protection of the Golden Sun Moth on the site, including control of Serrated Tussock.See above.</DOC>

Mr Arnan Rouse, the Director of Aged Care Services Australia Group (ACSAG), to which Mirridong belongs, has advised the Department of Health and Ageing that he has introduced a new staffing structure which improves outcomes for residents, staff and relatives. He indicates that the new structure involves more Registered Nurse (Division 1) hours, with a Registered Nurse (Division 1) on duty for all shifts; decreased Registered Nurse (Division 2) hours and more hours for Personal Care Workers. In the case of Mirradong, this will increase the number of floor hours by 55 hours per fortnight.The Government has legislated a set of standards for the provision of quality care and services by residential aged care homes - the Accreditation Standards. These include the requirement that homes have appropriately skilled and qualified staff sufficient to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with the Accreditation Standards. Accreditation decisions are made by the independent Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency.        The appropriate number and required skill sets of staff are affected by factors such as the nature of the care and service needs of residents, the nature of the building or buildings, the way work is organised and the extent to which some services are conducted in house or are outsourced. Thus the number and skill sets of staff will vary from home to home and from time to time as changes in the mix of residents' needs within a home occur.The aged care provider has the responsibility for making this decision based on the requirements of state or territory law affecting the responsibilities of nurses. In addition, the Quality of Care Principles 1997 require an approved provider to provide 'nursing services' for residents 'receiving a high level of residential care'. This includes a requirement that 'initial and on-going assessment, planning and management of care for residents [is] carried out by a registered nurse'.The issue of who may or may not administer medication is legislated by state and territory governments.Approved providers are required to meet their responsibilities under the Aged Care Act 1997 (the Act). The Accreditation Standards which have been developed under the Act cover a comprehensive range of care outcomes for residents that must be met by aged care service providers and cover much more than basic physical need. In order to meet these outcomes, the Act requires that approved providers maintain an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff and have in place a skills mix appropriate to the care needs of the residents. Providers must also have in place arrangements for the ongoing development of staff skills to ensure quality of care continues to be delivered. Providers must be able to demonstrate the achievements of these outcomes for residents, and this is done during the course of an accreditation audit directed by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency.The Accreditation Standards were developed in close consultation with service provider and consumer organisations. They were designed to ensure that residential aged care services have quality systems in place and strategies for continuous improvement that meet defined performance standards based on outcomes for residents.The current system of aged care provision recognises that changes in residents' needs, and the mix of residents, varies over time. Specifying inputs for every scenario would make it difficult to operate an aged care facility and would be difficult to monitor. Neither are inputs alone necessarily a reflection of the provision of good care. Quality outcomes for residents is the goal of Government and they are measured against the Accreditation Standards.</DOC>

The product was registered in June 2002 following a direction from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 11 February 2002 that the product 'be approved pursuant to s.25 of the Therapeutic Goods Act in accordance with the terms of that application'.The Cochrane review identified no trials meeting the full inclusion criteria however the review was looking specifically at smoking cessation criteria, assessed at follow up at least six months from the start of treatment, following the recommendations of the Russell Standard. The review identified two old studies that didn't meet these criteria for inclusion. The fact that these studies did not meet the criteria does not mean that they are necessarily invalid.It doesn't appear that the Cochrane review was looking at evidence criteria aimed specifically at assessing the indications for this product, that is the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms.It is a requirement of therapeutic goods advertising that all advertising complies with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code and it is a requirement of the code that an advertisement for therapeutic goods must contain correct and balanced statements only and claims which the sponsor has already verified.These claims were brought to the attention of the TGA Advertising unit which has referred the complaint to the Complaints Resolution Panel set up in the Therapeutics Goods Legislation to deal with complaints about therapeutic goods advertising directed to consumers.The Therapeutic Goods Act came into effect on 15 February 1991. With the implementation of the Act, Section 66 provided for a six month period in which sponsors, who had medicines on the market prior to the commencement of the Act, were able to apply for registration or listing of these products onto the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. It is not possible to state the number of residual 'grandfathered' products.Since February 1991, all new registered medicines have been fully evaluated. The Act also provided a number of post marketing powers such as auditing of products, sampling and testing, investigation of advertising concerns or adverse events. Of the products that were in existence prior to 1991 and entered onto the register as 'grandfathered' products, the registration details of most have subsequently been investigated by the TGA.</DOC>

The overarching legislation regulating the sale of all consumer products (including contact lenses) in Australia is the various state and territory trade practices legislation and the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974, which is administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Trade practices legislation ensure general consumer products are of high quality and fit for purpose.Specific regulatory controls on the sale of contact lenses, differ depending on whether the contact lenses are for cosmetic or therapeutic use, as follows:Novelty contact lenses for cosmetic useThe responsibility for regulating the sale of novelty contact lenses such as coloured lenses and cats' eyes for cosmetic purposes resides with the states and territories. New South Wales currently regulates novelty contact lenses under the Optical Dispensers Act 1963 which requires that cosmetic contact lenses can only be purchased through an optometrist or optical dispenser. Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are in the process of drafting similar legislation.Contact lenses for therapeutic useThe sale of contact lenses for therapeutic use (eg vision correction) is also regulated under state and territory legislation. In NSW this is the Optometrists Act 2002 which ensures that the sale and dispensing can only occur with a prescription from an optometrist. Similar legislation exists in all states and territories.The role of the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is confined to regulating the quality, safety and performance of contact lenses for therapeutic use. These contact lenses are regulated as low-medium risk medical devices and must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be legally supplied for sale in Australia.The TGA does not regulate coloured contact lenses or cats' eyes lenses for cosmetic use. These are novelty consumer products that do not have a therapeutic purpose and hence are outside the scope of TGA's mandate.Regulatory controls on the sale of these types of products through markets and unregulated commercial entities are most effectively administered at the point of sale. The states and territories have either implemented or are in the process of developing legislation to restrict the sale of these products.TGA's mandate applies only to products for therapeutic use. Novelty contact lenses are not therapeutic goods and hence cannot be regulated as medical devices under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 or included on the ARTG.</DOC>

Yes.Yes.There is no legislative requirement for domestic passengers to present identification at check-in at Australian airports. From a security perspective, the screening of passengers and their baggage is considered more effective than identity checking, in terms of deterring and preventing security incidents. This is particularly the case in domestic airports as passengers are able to mix freely with other people inside the airport terminal after being issued a boarding pass.The Australian Government requires a range of stringent measures to be applied to all persons travelling on domestic screened air services that operate from our major airports. These include screening of their person for weapons and prohibited items, screening of their personal carry-on baggage, the application of random and continuous explosive trace detection testing, as well as the screening of checked baggage. All persons entering a sterile area at an airport, whether they are travelling or not, must undergo the security screening process to gain entry to that sterile area.The self check-in arrangements adopted by Qantas and Virgin Blue are a matter for the airlines.</DOC>

Yes.On 22 August 2006, I announced my decision to list the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of patients with HER-2 positive early stage breast cancer. The drug will be listed from 1 October 2006. It will be subsidised for use following surgery, commenced concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy, and continued for a maximum period of 12 months.The duration and form of treatment was based on the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). PBAC is an independent, expert advisory body whose members include medical practitioners, health scientists, other health professionals and a consumer representative.In making its decision, PBAC considered all the evidence before it and determined that the proposed treatment regime was the most effective and cost effective.</DOC>

For 2005-06, phone cases made up 39% of small business (up to $10m turnover) compliance activity in the ATO.As indicated above, phone cases made up 39% of small business compliance activity. However, office and field based audits, reviews and letter products are also used. Telephone calls are made from the call centres for some issues, and by compliance case officers (not based in a call centre) for other issues.No, a small business can be contacted by different tax officers, depending on the nature of the enquiry. Each officer will establish the client profile by accessing business systems for information prior to contacting the business.The ATO does not provide binding oral rulings to small business clients on business tax issues.and (b) The ATO does not currently collect specific data in this regard.The ATO wants to see viable businesses continue to trade. Businesses are encouraged to approach the ATO where they face difficulties in making payments. Correspondence and phone contact are made before firmer action strategies are applied. Legal action is generally only taken after appropriate warnings are given and, where necessary, the ATO will take action leading to bankruptcy or company wind-up where debts are not addressed.In answering this question 'took legal action in a reporting period' has been interpreted to mean resolved through court proceedings (whether by obtaining judgment on a summons or the making of a winding-up or bankruptcy order) in that period (regardless of the commencement date). The dollar value of the debt is based on the amount initially claimed, which may be different from the amount referred to in final orders.In 2004, 62.8 % of court debt recovery cases involved debts of less than $25,000. The average time between issuing a summons and obtaining judgment was 177 days. The average time between lodging a winding-up or bankruptcy application and the making of final orders was 114 days.In 2005, 65.4 % of court debt recovery cases involved debts of less than $25,000. The average time between issuing a summons and obtaining judgment was 124 days. The average time between lodging a winding-up or bankruptcy application and the making of final orders was 128 days.</DOC>

In addition, street posting boxes will be provided to ensure that residents have access to a lodgement point within 2 kilometres.        In providing street posting boxes, Australia Post will give preference to locating them at:Regional and strip shopping centres,Commercial estates,Well used railway stations and transport interchange points,Universities; andAreas such as CBDs where heavy postings can be anticipated.In rural towns and communities, a street posting box will be provided at or near postal outlets.Additional factors to be considered in site selection include:Safe access, including good street lighting for customers and Post, employees/contractors clearing street posting boxes,Traffic restrictions and local/State laws and/or regulations,Customer access to nearby posting facilities; andCommunity views/needs.Consideration will be given to the provision of street posting boxes in special cases to cater for the needs of concentrations of the aged and disabled people, including hospitals.'In so far as relocation and removal are concerned, Australia Post has advised that the policy states:'From time to time consideration may need to be given to the relocation or removal of individual street posting boxes where, for example:Safety factors for either customers or staff have changed and the continued provision of the street posting box is considered dangerous (eg changed traffic conditions or changed traffic flows),The location of the street posting box is or has become contrary to Australian Road Rules,The average amount of mail posted per day is less than 25 items and an alternative street posting box is available,A postal outlet is relocated; orOngoing vandalism is a problem.Where a street posting box is considered for possible relocation or removal, a comprehensive consultation process will be undertaken to ensure community views or special needs are taken into account. Specifically,The local Federal Member and businesses likely to use the street posting box will be advised of the proposal and the rationale,Other users of the street posting box will be informed via:- a sign on the street posting box for a minimum of 30 days, and- a paid advertisement in the local newspaper.Any concerns will be discussed with respondents and the local Federal Member; andOnce a decision has been made, the local Federal Member, businesses and respondents will be advised accordingly, including the reasons for the decision. Other users will be informed of the outcome by means of a paid advertisement in the local newspaper.No relocation/removal action will commence until the consultative process is completed and the decision endorsed by senior management.In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to expedite the relocation of a street posting box for emergency or safety reasons (eg changed traffic conditions). In such cases, local residents and businesses would be appropriately informed. A general notice would also be placed in the local newspaper.'Australia Post has advised that it currently has plans to install one additional street posting box in postcode area 3029.</DOC>

The AFP has four Regional Rapid Deployment Teams (RRDT) deploy to airports around Australia. These teams are based at Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney airports, with each team having a geographic area of responsibility within Australia.The AFP received $20.7m over a five year period to fund the RRDT. The annual budget figure for the four RRDT is $4.1m per year. This gives an average cost per team of $1.025m per year.Each RRDT is made up of eight AFP Protective Service Officers. A team consists of a Team Leader (Senior Protective Security Officer), Deputy Team Leader (Protective Security Officer Grade 2), five Protective Security Officers and one Firearms Explosive Detection Canine and Handler. One team member will also perform the role of Bomb Appraisal Officer, which is a separate role to the canine handler.Each RRDT has one Firearm and Explosive Detection (FED) canine team, comprised of one canine and one handler, allocated to it for operational duties.Each RRDT is made up of eight AFP members.The average duration of training to develop a canine and their handler is 15 weeks which can be broken down into the following components:Pre-selection of canines, duration one week;Pre-course development of canines, duration two weeks; andCourse canine and handlers, duration 12 weeks.There is an ongoing requirement for revalidation training, which occurs after 12 months of operational deployment and runs for 4 weeks. Proficiency maintenance training requires one day per week and quality assurance requires two days every six months.(g)   The cost to train one FED canine team is $90,000. The ongoing revalidation training is $15,000 per annum per team.</DOC>

My Department also provides legal information to individual marriage celebrants who seek it in order to fulfil their obligations with regard to specific marriages they have performed or will be performing in the future. This information is provided in response to phone calls, e-mails and other requests in writing for information.Marriage celebrants appointed under the Marriage Celebrants Program are not officers of the Commonwealth, nor are they employed by the Commonwealth. They are authorised by the Commonwealth to perform marriages in accordance with the law and fulfil responsibilities provided for in the Marriage Act.I am not certain what body the honourable member is referring to as a 'non-elected national advisory council'. There is an organisation called the National Council of Authorised Celebrants Australia which consists of representatives from some of the marriage celebrant representative associations. In addition, there are 17 marriage celebrant associations across Australia which marriage celebrants may join. These associations are outside Government and it is not appropriate or possible for them to implement policy. They are at liberty to liaise with my Department and with me on behalf of their members and press for reform. Officers of my Department attend meetings of associations regularly. I have told marriage celebrant associations that I am available to meet with them at any mutually convenient time. I have met with a number of associations.and (b) The Australian Bureau of Statistics in the latest edition of its publication Marriages in Australia reports that, for the calendar year 2004, 110,958 marriages were solemnised in Australia. Of these, 65,100 or 58.7% were performed by civil marriage celebrants. Civil marriages are performed by civil marriage celebrants authorised by the Commonwealth and by State and Territory officers authorised to perform marriages in the offices of the Registries of Births Deaths and Marriages in each State and Territory and in some courts around Australia. My Department does not have information about the breakdown of the numbers of civil marriages performed by civil marriage celebrants, and State and Territory officers. It is therefore not possible to calculate the average number of marriages performed by civil marriage celebrants. However, based on information sent to my Department by civil marriage celebrants, for 2004-05 the following information is available: 434 performed no weddings, 1448 performed 1-50 weddings, 237 performed 51-100 weddings, 50 performed 101-150 weddings, 14 performed 151-200 weddings and 9 performed more than 200 weddings.My Department keeps records of the principal place of residence of Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants but does not keep records of the location of the weddings performed by individual marriage celebrants. Marriage celebrants are authorised to perform marriages at any place in Australia.</DOC>

The Request for Tender was advertised on the AusTender website on 30 June 2006. The expected contract period is an initial term of three (3) years with two (2), separate one (1) year options that the Commonwealth may exercise at its discretion.Office consumables to Senators and Members' electorate offices are currently supplied by Corporate Express Australia Ltd (Corporate Express). The former Department of Administrative Services entered into a contract with Corporate Express in February 1997 which provided, under a common use arrangement, for the supply of offices. This arrangement remained in effect after the creation of the Department of Finance and Administration. Following the contract's expiry in 2002, arrangements with Corporate Express were extended on a month to month basis.Corporate Express has held the contract since 1997.The contract is a common use arrangement and the value of the contract varies from year to year depending on the level of ordering activity. During the last three (3) financial years the expenditure on delivery of office consumables to Senators and Members' electorate offices has been:- Financial Year 2003-04 $3,151,992.63- Financial Year 2004-05 $4,540,095.92- Financial Year 2005-06 $3,831,644.07The Request for Tender (RFT) contains 192 pages, of which the draft contract represents eighty-eight (88) pages.The Australian Government procurement policy framework is non-discriminatory including in relation to the nationality of the companies that bid against the RFT. All potential suppliers should have the same opportunities to compete for Government business and must, subject to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, be treated equitably based on their legal, commercial, technical, and financial abilities, and not on their degree of foreign affiliation or ownership, location or size.The contract, once let, will engage a service provider on a non-exclusive basis. This would allow Senators and Members to order outside the contract, for example with a local business or businesses. There is no list of accredited service suppliers. The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines provide appropriate guidance to the low value purchasing process likely to arise in circumstances when Senators and Members purchase outside the contract. The intention of the contract is to allow Senators and Members access to the benefits that flow from the bulk buying power of a national service provider. Senators and Members will be advised by circular once the contract is let.Please note: The delivery of office consumables is limited to all current Senators and Members' electorate offices and to the Commonwealth-funded offices of former Prime Ministers. The current contract and the proposed new contract will not deliver consumables to other retired Members of Parliament.</DOC>

Yes. Pages 41 and 42 of the discussion paper discuss the diversity test.A commercial media group or 'voice' would be comprised of one or more of a commercial television licensee, commercial radio licensee or associated newspaper (that is, those entities currently subject to the cross-media rules) where these are taken to be under common control, as defined in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.A market would be based on the relevant licence area as defined in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in the same manner as the existing cross media restrictions.No.The Government's media reform package has been developed after an extensive and open consultation process. Throughout the process the Government has sought to balance the views and needs of industry, consumers and other stakeholders to develop a comprehensive plan that sets the foundations for a strong media industry, ready to tackle the challenges posed by innovation and technological change in the sector.The Government received a strong response to the discussion paper with more than 200 submissions received from members of the public, media sector commentators and nearly all large, and a number of smaller, radio, television and newspaper owners and their industry associations.Given the excellent stakeholder response to the discussion paper I consider that five weeks was an appropriate period of time for stakeholders to express their views on the content of the discussion paper.No. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2006 implements the Government's decision in relation to media ownership reform.</DOC>

As noted in my reply to Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee Question on Notice 39 dated 20 February 2006, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware that certain Australian companies are importing phosphate possibly sourced from Western Sahara. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not have on record any imports from Western Sahara for the period of January 1988  -  June 2006 (ABS, 5369: International Trade in Goods and Services, Australia, Table 14b). I understand that the port of Laayoune is designated under the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/Locode) as a Moroccan port. The UN/Locode manual includes a disclaimer that designation of ports does not imply 'the legal status of any country, territory, city or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries'. Goods recorded as being shipped to Australia from Laayoune, and separately declared as originating from Morocco, are recorded as imports from Morocco.As I stated in my reply to Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee Question on Notice 39 dated 20 February 2006, I am aware of the opinion of Mr Hans Corell, former United Nations Under-Secretary General of Legal Affairs, of 29 January 2002. Mr Corell's opinion is not legally binding and does not set out measures to be taken by states to prohibit imports from Western Sahara. There are no United Nations Security Council sanctions or Australian bilateral sanctions prohibiting imports from Western Sahara or Morocco. Nevertheless, my department draws the opinion of Mr Corell to the attention of all companies which make inquiries in relation to commercial activities in Western Sahara. Further, my department has placed a notice on the DFAT website, noting that 'there are international law considerations with importing natural resources sourced from the Western Sahara'. It is recommended that companies seek independent legal advice before importing such material.</DOC>

The financial institution took appropriate steps in this case. The financial institution identified a possible suspicious client account holding and informed the Australian Federal Police (AFP), as per established protocols. The AFP confirmed that the financial institution's client was not the same entity as the listed terrorist organisation and advised the financial institution accordingly. The financial institution then 'unfroze' the assets. This precautionary approach is required to give effect to Australia's international obligations to prevent the transfer of financial resources to terrorist entities.</DOC>

I have asked my Department to assess the robustness of the SES funding arrangements and how well the arrangements meet the Government's objectives for the funding of non-government schools.The review committee will consult with targeted key stakeholder groups as necessary. This will include taking into account the outcomes of the National Catholic Education Commission's (NCEC) working party to review the effectiveness and benefits of the SES funding arrangements and any related work undertaken by other non-government school authorities.Any person or group is welcome to provide written comments to my Department's review committee.

Yes to all parts.Yes.Base salary is used primarily for the purpose of calculating a secretary's salary for superannuation purposes. As such, it should reflect the value of the cash component of a secretary's remuneration package, as is the case for other public servants. The determination made on 4 August 2006 increased base salary from 73% of total remuneration to 80% of base salary as it was considered to be a more accurate reflection of the value of the cash salary available to secretaries. While this change will increase secretaries' superannuation benefits on retirement, it will also increase their notional superannuation contributions by around $4,000 a year, resulting in an immediate reduction of the same amount in their take home pay.As required by subsection 61(2) of the Public Service Act 1999, I consulted the Remuneration Tribunal before making the determination in question. The Tribunal supported the proposed amendment.The Tribunal also agreed that it would be appropriate to change the arrangements applying to secretaries who are terminated before their appointments expire so that they would be entitled to a minimum termination payment of three months' base salary. The Tribunal noted that the holders of public offices in its jurisdiction are entitled to a minimum of four months' base salary in similar circumstances.</DOC>

The Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) did not declare the land at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre to be free of contamination in July 2002, prior to its transfer to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA).Investigation and testing works did not produce a contamination-free finding. The investigation and testing involved the excavation of test pits, visual assessment, and soil sampling. The investigation and testing was carried out by Noel Arnold and Associates Pty Ltd at a cost of approximately $13,000.Finance has been advised by DIMA that asbestos was found in 51 of the 842 samples taken in April 2006. Its sampling indicated that the concentration of asbestos in the soil was such that it would not produce unacceptable levels of fibre into the air based on enHealth Council guidelines Management of Asbestos in the Non-occupational Environment (2005) published by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing.Finance has been advised by DIMA that staff and detainees have not been contacted as they have not been able to access any of the areas where asbestos from remnant footings was discovered in May 2002. These areas were fenced off and warning signs installed at that time. In April 2006, following the discovery of surface material potentially containing asbestos in the fenced off area, a mitigation strategy was implemented by DIMA based on independent professional advice, and a number of individuals and organisations were contacted including:The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs staff at Villawood and Canberra;The Department of Health and Ageing;The Department of Finance and Administration;Comcare;The Commonwealth Ombudsman;The NSW Police;GSL (Australia) Pty Ltd; andVillawood Immigration Detention Centre detainees.Air quality monitoring was in place during the mitigation work and over the Easter period and continues in some areas of the site. To date, all results have been within acceptable levels.</DOC>

The Government has introduced a number of initiatives to promote Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as an alternative fuel.The Australian Government's Energy White Paper outlines a generous framework for the alternative fuels sector to develop and promote their products in the marketplace. CNG is excise free until 2011. There will be a transitional introduction of effective excise rates from 2011 to 2015. However, the final excise rate for CNG in 2015 will still be 50% lower than other transport fuels of similar energy content reflecting a range of industry, regional and other factors.Natural gas fuels require specialised tanks and specialised refuelling equipment. As a result, CNG in Australia to date has primarily been used in heavy vehicles such as buses, trucks and in garbage collection, which have the advantage of centralised refuelling depots and sufficient storage space in the vehicle to facilitate the additional fuel tank. CNG is used in around 1,100 public transport buses in Australia, mainly Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. Of these, 718 have been funded under the Australian Government's $33.6 million Alternative Fuels Conversion Programme (AFCP).The AFCP was launched in January 2000 and provides grants for the purchase of CNG, LNG and LPG powered heavy vehicles, and the conversion of diesel-powered heavy vehicles to these fuels.Through the AFCP, I am advised that Government officials have worked in partnership with transport operators and gas industry stakeholders on seven demonstration projects in an attempt to identify the conditions under which natural gas heavy vehicles could be developed to deliver greenhouse benefits to the community and economic benefits to vehicle operators. The results of these projects will be made available to all interested parties following completion of the trials.</DOC>

 A Summary and Addressing Barriers to the Employment and Training of Trainees and Apprentices in the Australian Minerals Industry. The first report, which focuses on access to the international labour market notes a significant amount of progress has been made in the area of skilled migration within the minerals industry. The Government response to industry requirements in this area has removed many of the perceived and real barriers to skilled migration. In particular, the minerals industry is now making greater use of temporary-entry sponsorship provisions. The report notes global competition for skilled and experienced miners has increased, and recommends the reclassification of geologists and metallurgists on the Skilled Occupation List. It also recommends that Government create a new temporary resident regional visa category to address labour shortages associated with the start-up phase of new mines and the provision of infrastructure.The second report, which focuses on training in the Australian Minerals Industry, found that there are very few structural barriers to addressing the challenges to employment and training of traditional apprentices and trainees in the minerals industry.A New National Approach to Apprenticeships, Training and Skills Recognition  -  Council of Australian GovernmentsCOAG has reached agreement on a package of measures designed to underpin a new genuinely national approach to apprenticeships, training and skills recognition and alleviate skill shortages currently evident in some parts of the economy. While governments have agreed to tackle some of the obstacles within the system of government, industry also has a critical role to play in creating solutions. In preparing these measures, COAG officials consulted with industry bodies and unions.An additional $64.3 million over four years was allocated in the 2006/07 Budget to implement the new national approach.To ensure and assure the quality of outcomes from the training system, COAG has agreed to accelerate the introduction of a national outcomes-based auditing model and stronger outcomes-based quality standards for registered training organisations in consultation with key parties including employers, regulators and unions. Specific quality assurance measures have also been built into the proposals.</DOC>

Supplies of accommodation in commercial residential premises are taxable, unless the existing option to input tax long - term accommodation in commercial residential premises is exercised.The decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia in Marana Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 307 (Marana) was about whether the sale of a unit, which was previously a room in a motel, was the sale of 'new residential premises' and thus subject to GST.A person who entered into an investment following the Marana case will be treated in the same way as the majority of taxpayers who relied upon the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO's) published view in GST Ruling 2000/20. They will not be able to claim an input tax credit on the purchase price. However, as the supply is input taxed, they will not be required to remit GST on a later sale of the property, nor on rent received.and (4) There is only a very small number of input tax credit claims in respect of premises in question that are pending with the ATO. There is only a handful of taxpayers who will have to repay input tax credits as a result of the amendments.</DOC>

Doxycycline is the principal anti-malarial prophylaxis prescribed by the Australian Defence Force to Defence personnel deployed overseas. Mefloquine Hydrochloride (Larium) is only prescribed where doxycycline is not tolerated well by an individual. Mefloquine is also not approved for use by Australian Defence Force aircrew.Mefloquine was introduced into the Defence pharmaceutical inventory on 13 September 1990. The information sought in the honourable member's question on how many personnel were prescribed Mefloquine is not readily available. To collect and assemble such information solely for the purpose of answering the question would be a major task, and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and effort that would be required.</DOC>

The investigation concluded that a breach of procurement policy had not occurred. The investigation also concluded that the individual did not possess or previously have access to privileged information pertaining to Defence Regional Information Communication Technology (ICT) service management.Formal administrative sanctions were imposed on the member as approval to work in off-duty hours should have been sought before the work was undertaken. There was no action taken against the company involved.Notice that the Inspector General was investigating a possible breach of the tendering processes was received by the Regional ICT Market Testing Project (tender authority) a few days prior to the close of the tender.The work in question was undertaken during a period of long service leave and did not conflict with the member's official duties.24 November 2005.23 November 2005.Yes. The member received signed retrospective approval for the work undertaken.The Australian Financial Review article did state that an announcement of the preferred tenderer was expected by May 2006. This was based on an estimate derived on the number of anticipated responses from industry. The number of responses received exceeded expectations and the period required to undertake a full assessment has had to be increased.It is now expected that a recommendation will be made to the internal Defence Information Technology Board by December 2006.</DOC>

The joint Commonwealth/State National Evaluation of the fourth Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP IV) provided a number of options for the future of SAAP.Although responsibility for the day-to-day administration of SAAP, including the procurement and funding of services, rests with the NSW Government, the Australian Government is very serious about its commitment to support for homeless people. As a result, the Australian Government is making a substantial financial contribution to state and territory governments to assist them meet their obligations in this area. In fact, the Australian Government has committed an additional $100 million in funds for the next five years of the programme. In particular, the Australian Government's overall contribution to NSW under SAAP V has increased by some $35 million. NSW is not contributing additional funds to SAAP V. However, they are always welcome to do so.SAAP assists some 22,000 people daily with a range of support services, including providing accommodation for accompany children. However, some people are unable to be assisted with SAAP accommodation immediately. The National Data Collection shows that although some families with children are unable to be immediately accommodated in SAAP accommodation, they are assisted with finding alternative accommodation and/or with other support services. The ratio of unmet demand to total demand for accommodation for accompanying children was 2.6 to 100. This means that of the 4,600 children seeking accommodation each day, over 97% are accommodated on the day their parents or carers sought the accommodation.Similarly, according to the Demand for SAAP 2003-04 Report, the ratio of unmet demand to total demand for single women was 1.10 to 100. This means that over 98% of all single women seeking accommodation each day were accommodated on that day. The data showed that most of those unable to be accommodated by SAAP received some kind of assistance such as referrals to other agencies, financial and material aid, transport and advice or information.Almost $120 million will be available under the SAAP V Agreement for investment and innovation projects aimed at achieving the strategic directions of SAAP V which include providing better pre-crisis intervention, better service system linkages, especially for families and children and better post-crisis transition assistance to achieve lasting outcomes and reduce repeat use of SAAP services. The support provided by these services will enable families to access and maintain stable forms of housing and reduce the risk of longer term family and intergenerational homelessness.As part of the package of mental health assistance measures announced recently by the Prime Minister, the Australian Government will also be providing $284.8 million over five years for 900 personal helpers and mentors to assist people living in the community to better manage their daily activities. As around 30 per cent of current SAAP clients have mental health issues, this additional support should help address some of the demand on SAAP service providers from this client group.</DOC>

3.1 The continued provision within the R.G. Casey Building of the Currawong Childcare Centre demonstrates the department's commitment to assist employees balance professional and personal responsibilities. In order to enhance DFAT employees' access to the Centre, DFAT employees have priority over employees from any other organisation in securing childcare places. Allocation of places at the Centre is managed by Centre management, in consultation with the department, through a system in which applicants are awarded points for a number of criteria. DFAT families returning unexpectedly from post for operational reasons and at the department's initiative will receive higher priority access to the Centre in accordance with the allocation policy. In order to provide quality, affordable child care, the department will work with the operator of the Centre to ensure that fees will be maintained at market rates. The department offers salary packaging of childcare fees for its employees with children in care at the Currawong Childcare Centre, as well as salary packaging of childcare fees for its employees with children in care at childcare centres associated with other APS agencies, consistent with taxation legislation and rulings.3.2 The department will reimburse additional childcare costs where employees are required by management to increase their hours of work to cover emergency situations or to meet short term work commitments, including short term missions.'DFAT reimburses additional childcare costs that are incurred as a result of particular work obligations, as outlined in paragraph 3.2 of the Collective Agreement - see (7) above. To support staff located overseas in the effective discharge of their representational responsibilities, limited childminding costs can be reimbursed under representation allowance provisions. In some overseas locations household maintenance assistance is provided to staff, who can access a portion of that assistance to meet informal childcare costs.Yes.

CURRAWONG CHILDCARE CENTRE ALLOCATION POLICY
Priority CriterionPointsAt least one parent/legal guardian is a DFAT employeeA DFAT family already has a child in the centreNumber of months on the waiting list (points accrue for each month)402024. In order to support DFAT employees who are asked to return to Canberra from an overseas post or state office at the department's initiative, and at short notice, to meet the department's operational requirements, the allocation policy will accord an additional priority to meet the childcare needs of these employees.5. In accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Family and Community Services on the allocation of places in childcare services, the director of the centre may give priority consideration on a case-by-case basis to departmental employees whose immediate family includes a person with a disability.6. An application must include details of the child's date of birth, an estimated date of birth, or proof of authorisation to adopt. The director of the centre will update the waiting list at least every six months. An applicant on the waiting list who is no longer pregnant, or who no longer has a child to enrol in the centre, forfeits the place on the waiting list but can reapply in accordance with this policy.7. Applications from persons who are not DFAT employees will be considered only after demand for places in the centre from departmental employees have been met. Any places offered to non-DFAT applicants (including contractors engaged by DFAT) will be of limited duration. Places will be available until 31 December in the year they are offered and will then be subject to review and possible withdrawal should they be required by DFAT applicants.8. The director of the Currawong Childcare Centre will offer a childcare place to an applicant by telephone or email, and will check to ensure the message is received without delay. If there is no sign that the message has been received, the centre will contact the applicant by other means. The department will assist if necessary. Applicants are requested to respond, if possible, within 24 hours of receiving an offer. If they need more time to consider the offer, they must seek an extension from the centre director. If no prior arrangement has been agreed for a late response, offers will be deemed lapsed 72 hours after receipt.9. An applicant who does not receive the full number of days originally requested will go on a separate internal waiting list as of the date of registration of the original application. Priority for this list will be in accordance with the order of the date of application for the days sought. When days become available, they will be offered to DFAT applicants first. DFAT applicants whose childcare needs change after the original acceptance of a childcare place will be placed on the separate internal waiting list as of the day they notified the centre of their new care requirements. Priority will be in accordance with the date of application for the new care requirements.10. In cases where a DFAT employee with a child/children in the centre separates permanently from the department, s/he will be required to notify the director and discuss mutually convenient arrangements for the possible withdrawal of the child from the centre. This should occur no later than 31 December in the year the parent separates from the department, if places are required by DFAT applicants on the waiting list.11. To facilitate management of the waiting list, DFAT parents posted or transferred to a location outside Canberra are asked to notify the centre of their intended departure date as soon as possible.12. In the first instance, the director of the centre is responsible for resolving any dispute that may arise in relation to the implementation of this allocation policy. Disputes which cannot be resolved by the director of the centre will be referred to the Assistant Secretary, Staff Development and Post Issues Branch, for consideration and decision. The Corporate Management Division of the department reserves the right to monitor at any time the management of the waiting list.I have read and understood the allocation policy detailed above. I understand that available places at the Currawong Childcare Centre will be allocated according to this policy.Applicant's Signature     ______________________________ Date     ____/____/____Director's Signature         ______________________________ Date    
ATTACHMENT B
 All staff to see              No: P048528 March 2003File No.: 02/211615Subject: Remuneration Packaging of Childcare Fees at the Currawong Child Care Centre: Entitlement of DFAT Employees to Claim Childcare Benefits (CCB)
 P0174
Administrative Circular P0174 of 2 December 1998, informed employees that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had provided a private ruling allowing Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) exemption for employer-sponsored childcare at the Currawong Childcare Centre (the Centre). It has been confirmed that this private ruling continues to correctly state the department's position with respect to the FBT exemption and work-based childcare.2. The private ruling concludes that the department is able to offer remuneration packaging of the Centre's childcare fees. The ruling only refers to the Centre, not other forms of childcare (such as other centres, family day care or in-home care provided through an approved child care service). However, legal advice indicates that the FBT exemption would also apply to childcare centres provided at other Commonwealth agencies (i.e. another Commonwealth department or agency of the Commonwealth that cannot be made liable for taxation to the Commonwealth).3. In paragraph 3 of Administrative Circular P0174, it was noted that employees who chose to package childcare costs at the Centre were not entitled to child care payments such as Child Care Assistance and the Child Care Cash Rebate. These payments have since been replaced by the Child Care Benefit (CCB), but the restrictions remain. It is not possible for DFAT employees to access FBT-exempt remuneration packaging for childcare centres and also be eligible for a CCB. This situation arises as a result of the department directly assuming liability for the fees under a remuneration packaging arrangement.4. It is possible for employees to enter into a remuneration packaging arrangement where the employee incurs the liability for the childcare fees directly, and is also entitled to the CCB entitlement. However, such an arrangement will not attract the FBT exemption, and may not be cost effective for the employee.5. Prior to contacting the department to discuss packaging childcare fees, employees should seek independent financial advice on the value of forgoing CCB in preference to utilising the FBT exempt remuneration packaging arrangements.

http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/publications_resources/profiles/student_school_achievement_report.htm.The Australian Government's consultations with parents and educators have clearly shown that many parents want to be better informed about their child's progress in terms they can understand.The Australian Government has developed its policies concerning this issue after considering research and, in particular, after discussions with, and listening to the views of, parents.Assessing students against standards is important to ensure that they are progressing at a suitable rate and that any areas that require development are identified.These standardised assessments can be used for diagnostic purposes. Teachers can use the results to identify students' strengths and areas of need. Programmes can be modified or developed to meet these needs.Not all areas of learning can be assessed by standardised testing, which is complementary to class-based assessment and teacher judgements in providing a total picture of a student's development and progress at school.It is important that such reporting mechanisms be meaningfully communicated to parents.The Australian Government's requirements provide schools and education authorities with flexibility to build on good reporting practices they may be employing in conjunction with meeting the requirements for an assessment against achievement levels or bands labelled A-E or an equivalent. A five point scale (A-E grades or equivalent) tells parents whether their child has achieved well above, above, at, below, or well below the standard expected for their year.For example, the Victorian Government has sought to ensure consistent interpretation of performance at each achievement level across all its government schools, and the Victorian Catholic school system has chosen to use the Victorian Government approach.It has done this by defining A-E grades in terms of year levels. That is, an 'A' grade is equivalent to at least 12 months ahead of the year level being assessed, a 'B' grade is equivalent to at least 6 months ahead of the year level being assessed, a 'C' grade is at the expected standard for the year being assessed; a 'D' grade is equivalent to at least 6 months behind the year level being assessed; and an 'E' grade is equivalent to at least 12 months behind the year being assessed.I am aware that Victoria is currently implementing the Victorian Essential Learning Standards.Education authorities (including in Victoria) and/or schools are responsible for determining standards against which achievement levels or bands labelled A-E (or an equivalent) are defined. A - E (or equivalent) summative reporting is supported by other forms of reporting which provide evidence of student achievement, and is complementary to prevailing school assessment and reporting practices.I am keen to ensure that the new reporting requirements suit the needs of students and parents. The requirements for plain English student reports provide scope for schools to build on their existing reporting practices to suit their particular circumstances.I am also aware, through the Australian Government's consultations with parents and educators, that parents want to be better informed about their child's progress in terms they can understand.I am aware of reports that some teachers in Victoria are experiencing difficulty with reporting on English and Mathematics. I understand the significant challenges facing schools and systems as they implement large scale reforms to curriculum, assessment and reporting, in particular the Victorian Essential Learning Standards.If a subject or key learning area is worth teaching, it is worth assessing and reporting on it. It is reasonable for parents to expect to be provided with good, clear feedback about their child's progress.Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points are Victorian government requirements, and are not part of the Australian Government's plain English student report requirements as set out in either the principles for student reports in the Act or the Regulations to the Act.The sample student reports on the website of the Victorian Department of Education and Training do not mention Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points.The Australian Government will continue to work with the Victorian Government to ensure that Victoria's student reports comply with the requirements for plain English reporting.</DOC>

It is usual practice for items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule to describe the medical procedure rather than the reason for the procedure. As such there can often be more than one reason why a particular service is performed.At this stage there is no consideration being given to amending the current arrangements for describing clinical services in the Medicare Benefits Schedule.</DOC>

 (a) (b) and (c) As part of the Strengthening Medicare package, the Australian Government introduced additional payments to encourage general practitioners (GPs) to bulk bill Commonwealth concession cardholders and children under 16 years of age. These incentives are currently $5.15 in metropolitan areas and $7.85 in rural areas, Tasmania, and eligible metropolitan areas with below average bulk billing rates and below average doctor-to-population ratios.These incentives encourage GPs to bulk bill senior Australians who have pensioner concession cards, and also those who qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including self-funded retirees.GPs in the electorate of Lyons can access the higher incentive of $7.85 when they bulk bill eligible patients. This incentive adds income of around $20,500 each year to a GP who provides an average mix of services.These measures were also complemented on 1 January 2005 by an increase in the rebate for all non-hospital GP attendances from 85% to 100% of the Medicare Schedule Fee. This increased the Medicare rebate for a standard GP consultation by $4.60.Statistics for the June quarter 2006 show that bulk billing for non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, has increased to 76.6%  -  up 10.1 percentage points since the December quarter 2003 (the last complete quarter prior to the introduction of the Strengthening Medicare initiatives). The bulk billing rate of 76.6% in the June quarter is the highest rate for five years. Bulk billing rates for non-referred GP attendances have now increased in 10 consecutive quarters.The bulk billing rates for non-referred GP attendances for children under 16 years and for persons in rural and remote areas are now at record levels. The rate of bulk-billing for children under 16 years increased to 83.8% and the rate of bulk-billing for persons in rural and remote areas increased to 71.3%, in the June quarter 2006.A nine-year high was also reached for bulk billing of non-referred GP attendances to persons aged 65 years and over in the June quarter 2006, with bulk-billing rates of 86.8% - the highest since the June quarter of 1997.Increases in bulk-billing rates for GP attendances in the June quarter 2006, compared with the December 2003 quarter (the last complete quarter before the Strengthening Medicare initiatives), include:New South Wales up 6.6 percentage points to 82.3%;South Australia up 15.2 percentage points to 75.8%;Victoria up 10.9 percentage points to 74.5%;Queensland up 12.5 percentage points to 74.2%;Western Australia up 9.7 percentage points to 72.2%;Tasmania up 21.6 percentage points to 70%;Northern Territory up 2.4 percentage points to 62.6%; andAustralian Capital Territory up 12 percentage points to 46.9%.Medicare bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances, by electorate, are published by the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicare Australia, on their respective web sites, on an annual calendar year basis in February/March each year.In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 76.1% of non-referred GP attendances (excluding practice nurse items) to patients with a Medicare enrolment postcode in the electorate of Lyons were bulk billed, an increase of 4.6 percentage points on calendar year 2004.The Extended Medicare Safety Net was introduced in March 2004 and protects all Australians from high out-of-pocket medical costs incurred for Medicare services outside of hospital.In calendar year 2005, over 4 million Australian families had registered for the Medicare safety nets.In calendar year 2005 (year of processing), 3,682 persons (1,894 families) in the electorate of Lyons received a total of $433,611 in supplementary benefits under the Medicare safety nets.Strengthening Medicare also introduced more services for aged care residents. A new Medicare item now covers comprehensive medical assessments for residents of aged care homes. As of 30 June 2006, over 56,000 of these comprehensive medical assessments had been conducted since their introduction on 1 July 2004. GPs are also being funded to work with aged care homes to improve access for residents of aged care homes and to improve the quality of care for all residents. Currently, every Division of General Practice in Australia has a GP aged care panel in operation.The Supporting Rural and Remote Procedural GPs initiative under Strengthening Medicare provides support for doctors in rural areas to continue providing procedural services. Procedural GPs are being reimbursed up to $10,000 for the cost of two weeks of training each year, with this funding also reimbursing doctors for the costs of employing a locum as, in most cases, doctors would be required to leave their practice to attend training in capital cities.In addition, GPs in rural and remote areas who provide anesthetic, surgical and obstetric procedural services are able to access payments of up to $10,000 a year through the Practice Incentive Program. Rural practices are provided with a rural loading of between 15% to 50% (depending on remoteness of the practice) on top of the procedural payment. From November 2006, the procedural payments for GPs delivering 20 or more babies a year will increase to $17,000 a year.Increased rural retention payments have also been continued under Strengthening Medicare for another four years to recognise the commitment of GPs who provide services to rural and remote communities for extended periods of time.Additionally, the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) includes a number of items that support primary medical care for patients, including older Australians and Australians living in rural and regional areas.
Chronic Disease Management
In addition to normal GP consultation items, specific items are available for Chronic Disease Management (CDM). In July 2005, new CDM items were added to the MBS which introduced a simplified way for GPs to assist patients in the management of a wide range of chronic (or terminal) conditions. These items are available to patients of any age. They enable the management of a patient's chronic (or terminal) condition/s to be addressed in a structured format through the development of a GP Management Plan, which includes setting management goals for the patient and identifying the health and care services they require. Where a patient has complex needs the GP is able to coordinate the involvement of multiple health care providers involved in the patient's care through the development of Team Care Arrangements.
Health Assessments for Older Australians (Medicare Items 700 to 706)
The Annual Health Assessment for Older Australians provides a Medicare rebate for GPs to undertake a comprehensive assessment of patients aged 75 years and over, or in the case of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, 55 years and over. These items provide an opportunity to assess the patient's physical, psychological and social function so that the GP can identify the need for any further intervention and plan preventative health care.
Medication Management Reviews (Medicare Items 900 &amp; 903)
Medication Management Reviews provide a Medicare rebate for GP services where a GP works in collaboration with a pharmacist to review the medication management needs of patients, either in the community or in residential aged care facilities, who are at risk of medication related problems.
Allied Health and Dental Care Initiative (Medicare items 10950  -  10977)
 Aboriginal health workers; audiologists; chiropodists; chiropractors; dentists (through the dental care plan); diabetes educators; dietitians; exercise physiologists; mental health workers; occupational therapists; physiotherapists; podiatrists; psychologists; osteopaths; and speech pathologists. While the Allied Health and Dental Care initiative is not specifically targeted at older people, almost half of the allied health services have been accessed by people aged 65 years and older.
Case Conferences (Medicare Items 734 - 779)
The MBS Case Conference items further support GPs to organise and participate in the care of patients with chronic conditions. Multidisciplinary case conferences are available for patients with at least one chronic medical condition and complex care needs who require a range of different services to support them in the community, in residential aged care, or on discharge from hospital. Around half of all GP case conferences have been provided to people aged 65 years and over.
Notes to the Statistics
Medicare statistics relate to non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, that were rendered on a 'fee-for-service' basis and for which claims were processed by Medicare Australia in calendar year 2005. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Veterans' Affairs patients and some compensation cases.The Medicare bulk billing and safety net statistics by electorate are based on 2004 electorate boundaries.The electorate statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file showing the proportion of the population of each postal area in each electorate. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data relating to post office box postcodes are excluded from electorate reporting as these cannot be appropriately allocated.Medicare safety nets only apply to non-hospital patient billed services.The statistics on the number of people who received safety net benefits include singles and people in families.Where the patient does not pay the total fee charged by the doctor prior to submitting their account to Medicare for reimbursement through a 'pay doctor cheque', Medicare Australia is unable to verify, for safety net purposes, that the total charge has been paid. This is regarded as an unsubstantiated claim. Proof of payment of the full amount charged results in a substantiated claim. The number of people in the table who have received a benefit under the safety net includes only those patients who substantiated their claims and presented a subsequent claim to Medicare Australia. Note that this number is not equivalent to the number of people reaching the thresholds.Medicare safety net information includes payments made under the original Medicare safety net and the Extended Medicare safety net.It is important to note that some people would receive assistance from services outside this electorate, and similarly services located in this electorate may provide assistance to people living in other electorates.Additional information and explanatory notes for bulk billing and safety net statistics are available on the Department's web site at www.health.gov.au/electoratereports.</DOC>

A Government-funded safety net to cover all Australians against high out-of-pocket medical costs outside the hospital system was introduced on 12 March 2004. It introduced for the first time a comprehensive Government-funded safety net to cover all Australians against high out-of-pocket medical costs for Medicare-claimable services provided outside hospital. Out-of-hospital services are defined as those services provided to non-admitted patients, such as services conducted in doctors' rooms, private clinics and private hospital emergency departments.The Australian Government was concerned at the level of out-of-pocket costs that some families and individuals face. Under the extended Medicare safety net, Medicare meets 80% of out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-claimable services provided outside hospital, once annual thresholds are reached. In 2006, the lower threshold is $500 for families entitled to receive Family Tax Benefit (A) and concession cardholders, and the upper threshold is $1,000 for all other individuals and families.Out-of-pocket costs are defined as the difference between fees charged by the doctor and Medicare benefits paid. It should be noted that the safety net covers out-of-pocket expenses for a specific Medicare service, but does not cover other fees or charges levied by the doctor that are not directly associated with the service provided or are not claimable through Medicare.The extended Medicare safety net operates in conjunction with the original Medicare safety net. The original Medicare safety net covers the difference between Medicare benefits paid and the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee for out-of-hospital services. Once out - of-p ocket costs (representing the difference between these two) accumulate to a threshold of $345.50, Medicare benefits increase to 100% of the schedule fee, rather than the standard Medicare benefit of 85% of the schedule fee. Where the original safety net threshold of $345.50 is reached first, a patient will receive 100% of the schedule fee, and any remaining out - of - pocket costs will continue to accumulate towards the extended safety net threshold relevant to their circumstances.In 2005, the first full calendar year of operation of the extended Medicare safety net, more than 4 million families were registered for the safety nets, and nearly 2 million qualified to receive safety net benefits. More than $280 million was spent through the safety nets helping almost 1.25 million people with higher Medicare rebates in 2005.The Australian Government has introduced a number of policies to ensure that Australians continue to have affordable access to medicines, primarily through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). In 2004-05 the PBS subsidised the dispensing of 170.3 million scripts at a cost to Government of $6 billion.Key features of the PBS that address affordable access to medicines include:sponsors seeking to have drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) must demonstrate that the treatments are clinically effective and cost effective;patients pay co-payments towards the cost of PBS medicines, which balance the contributions of government and patients  -  the payment to government is currently $4.70 per dispensing for concession card holders and $29.50 for general patients;PBS safety net arrangements protect patients who need very large numbers of prescriptions;there are clear conditions on the use of restricted PBS medicines with particular emphasis on high cost medicine groups;special access arrangements are in place for particular highly specialised drugs and their provision is managed in cooperation with state and territory governments through hospitals;other special programs ensure affordable access, such as the Human Growth Hormone Program and a special Indigenous program;the 12.5% price reduction policy, which took effect in August 2005, promotes value for the taxpayer when generic competition occurs. When the first new generic brand of a drug is introduced, all listed brands of that drug must take a 12.5% price cut and the price reduction flows on to other drugs in the reference price group; andthe prices of all PBS-listed medicines are reviewed annually by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority.The Government has a range of programs to support the provision of GP services after hours.Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP ServicesAs a result of the Government's election 2004 policy 'Round the Clock Medicare: Investing in After Hours GP Services', the Government is providing $555.8 million over five years for:new Medicare items from 1 January 2005 for after hours GP attendances, set at $10 higher than the corresponding in-hours items; andthree new grants (operating subsidies, start-up grants and supplementary grants), available through competitive annual funding rounds which commenced in 2004-05, to support both new and established after hours general practice services.The 2006-07 round of Round the Clock Medicare grant funding was advertised in April 2006. (details about the 2006-07 round are available at www.health.gov.au.) More than 160 applications were received and are currently being assessed.To date, some 46 grants across Australia including operating subsidies, start-up grants and supplementary grants have been announced from the 2005-06 and 2004-05 rounds of Round the Clock Medicare grant funding. More grants are expected to be announced in the future.Medicare emergency after hours itemsThe Round the Clock Medicare after hours Medicare items outlined above are in addition to the Medicare items for emergency after hours attendances which were introduced in 1990. The emergency items are intended to remunerate GPs who have to return to their surgery or provide a home visit to a patient who requires immediate treatment, in the after hours period.The $10 Round the Clock Medicare after hours loading introduced from 1 January 2005 was also added to the rebates for the emergency after-hours items.After Hours Primary Medical Care (AHPMC) ProgramThe Round the Clock Medicare grant funding outlined above builds on the Government's AHPMC Program, which was announced in the 2001-02 Budget. A number of after hours services across Australia continue to receive funding support through the AHPMC Program.Practice Incentives Program (PIP)The PIP After Hours Incentive aims to encourage GPs to provide quality after hours services.There are three tiers of payments for the After Hours Incentive:Tier 1  -  The practice ensures all regular practice patients have access to 24 hour care, including access to out of hours visits (at home, in a residential aged care facility and in hospital) where it is safe and reasonable for these visits to be provided.Tier 2  -  Practices must meet Tier 1 requirements. Practices with less than 2,000 SWPEs (or Standardised Whole Patient Equivalents) must provide at least ten hours per week of after hours cover for practice patients, while practices with 2,000 SWPEs or more must provide at least 15 hours per week of after hours cover.Tier 3  -  The practice GPs must provide 24 hour cover, seven days a week, including out of hours visits (at home, in a residential aged care facility and in hospital), where it is safe and reasonable for these visits to be provided.Around 21% of PIP payments are for the After Hours Incentive. This equates on average to around $12,000 per PIP practice. In 2005-06, the total expenditure on the PIP After Hours Incentive was around $56 million. In May 2006, 97% of practices were participating in Tier 1, 66% in Tier 2 and 27% in Tier 3.National Health Call Centre Network (NHCCN)The Government is also working with the states and territories to establish a NHCCN. Once established, the NHCCN will enable anyone, anywhere in Australia, to ring for health advice and information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NHCCN will provide callers with round-the-clock phone access to nurses who will assess their symptoms, how urgently they need to be seen and, if treatment is necessary, where they should be seen (e.g. at a hospital or by a GP). In regional areas, where medical services are not always easily accessible, the NHCCN will provide a readily available source of basic medical advice.The NHCCN is expected to take first calls in July 2007, with national coverage achieved within four years.(d)   The Government provides the 30% rebate for all people aged under 65. The rebate is 35% for people aged 65 to 69 and 40% for people aged 70 and over. The rebate applicable to a health insurance policy is based on the age of the oldest person covered by the policy. The estimated total cost of the Private Health Insurance Rebates in 2005-06 was $3,179 million.</DOC>

(a) and (b) As part of the Strengthening Medicare package, the Australian Government introduced additional payments to encourage GPs to bulk bill Commonwealth concession cardholders and children under 16 years of age. These incentives are currently $5.15 in metropolitan areas and $7.85 in rural areas, Tasmania, and eligible metropolitan areas with below average bulk billing rates and below average doctor-to-population ratios.These incentives encourage GPs to bulk bill senior Australians who have pensioner concession cards, and also those who qualify for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, including self-funded retirees.GPs in the electorate of Capricornia can access the higher incentive of $7.85 when they bulk bill eligible patients. This incentive adds income of around $20,500 each year to a GP who provides an average mix of services.These measures were also complemented on 1 January 2005 by an increase in the rebate for all non-hospital GP attendances from 85% to 100% of the Medicare Schedule Fee.

Medicare bulk billing statistics for non-referred GP attendances, by electorate, are published on an annual calendar year basis in February/March.In 2005, 66% of non-referred GP attendances to persons in the federal electorate of Griffith were bulk billed.
Notes to the Statistics
This statistic relates to non-referred GP attendances, excluding practice nurse items, that were rendered on a 'fee-for-service' basis and for which claims were processed by Medicare Australia in 2005. Excluded are details of non-referred GP attendances to public patients in hospital, to Veterans' Affairs patients and some compensation cases.The statistic is based on 2004 electorate boundaries.The statistic was compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file showing the proportion of the population of each postal area in each electorate. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data relating to post office box postcodes is excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated.Additional information and explanatory notes for bulk billing statistics are available on the Department's web site at www.health.gov.au/electoratereports.</DOC>

Yes.The Government is aware of differing assessments of the allegations of widespread organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners. Mr Kilgour and Mr Matas concluded the allegations were true, but others have come to different conclusions.US Embassy and Consular officials visited Sujiatun, the location most frequently referred to in Falun Gong media reports, and found no evidence that the site was being used for any function other than as a normal public hospital.Harry Wu, a renowned activist on human rights in China, had his contacts examine Sujiatun and the surrounding area over the course of three weeks from 12 March. These contacts produced several reports and photographs from their investigations, which Mr Wu says show no signs of a 'concentration camp'.The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Mr Manfred Nowak, said in March that he would look into the allegations and submit a report to the Chinese Government if he found that the allegations were well-founded. He has not so far submitted any report.Reputable human rights organisations have issued no public comment to date.My Department has sought information from and exchanged views with other governments, reputable human rights organisations, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. A senior DFAT official also met Mr Kilgour during his recent visit to Australia and discussed the report with him.Yes.My Department raised this issue with China during our annual human rights dialogue on 25 July 2006, and suggested that China address the allegations by allowing an independent, credible investigator unfettered access to facilities of his/her choosing. Australian officials have since reiterated this suggestion to the Chinese.The Chinese said the allegations were fabrications.Yes. The Government strongly opposes China's ban on Falun Gong and its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, which we consider breach fundamental human rights, including the rights of assembly and free expression.We have raised China's treatment of Falun Gong practitioners regularly since Falun Gong was banned in 1999. We have done this through our annual human rights dialogue, through our Embassy in Beijing and during high-level visits. I raised the issue myself during a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Li Zhaoxing, during his visit to Australia in April this year, and with the leader of the Chinese delegation to the human rights dialogue, Assistant Minister Cui Tiankai, in July.China responds that practitioners who have been arrested and imprisoned have broken Chinese laws.No.</DOC>

No. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post's board of directors and management are responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation and do not require ministerial approval for changes such as this. Australia Post is required, as far as practicable, to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post's board determines the terms and conditions, including rates of postage, of the services supplied by Australia Post.Australia Post has advised that it undertook extensive market research before making its decision.In relation to the possible impact of the decision on export-oriented businesses, Australia Post has advised that the international parcels business operates in a fully deregulated environment with Australia Post offering a commercial service in competition with a range of other service providers.Post currently has a commercial agreement with the Australian Booksellers Association which provides significant discounts for members on published prices. The current agreement is due to expire at the end of October and negotiations on new contractual arrangements have begun.Other export-oriented businesses with regular international parcel despatches may be in a position to negotiate special contract rates with Australia Post.See the answer to part (1).</DOC>

I am aware of the reports, but cannot confirm the details. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, from 1995 to 2005 most of Sudan's military arsenal came from Russia and not China. Nevertheless, China is a major arms exporter, and it is widely understood that China is the source, either directly or indirectly, of many of the weapons and other items of equipment employed in the ongoing conflict in Sudan.I am aware of the reports, but cannot confirm them.China has resisted efforts to apply international pressure on the Government of Sudan. But China has allowed the passage of a number of United Nations Security Council resolutions addressing the situation in Darfur by not exercising its veto power.The Government is very concerned about the situation in Darfur. We would be disturbed by any activities which exacerbated the situation.China is well aware of Australia's views. The Australian Government is a strong advocate of responsible arms exports, including exports with assurances about the end-user and purpose for the export, and has regular exchanges with China on these issues through our bilateral arms control and regional security dialogue. Australia also conducts outreach activities with China on a range of arms control issues, including through the Wassenar Arrangement and the Australia group.Australia is not a member of the United Nations Security Council but we did call for, and have supported, strong Security Council action on Darfur. Australia was active in ensuring the Security Council, through Resolution 1591 of 29 March 2005, implemented an arms embargo in Darfur, established a no-fly zone over Darfur and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on individuals who impede the peace process or commit crimes or atrocities. Australia also supported the UN Security Council's Resolution 1593 of 31 March 2005 which referred crimes committed in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC), of which Australia was a key proponent. UN Security Council Resolution 1672 of 25 April 2006 imposed financial and travel sanctions on four individuals because of their activities in Darfur. One of those four is a Regional Commander in the Sudanese Air Force. Australia is in the process of implementing these sanctions against those four individuals.The Government welcomes the UN Security Council's Resolution 1706 of 31 August 2006 calling for the transition of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to a United Nations force by no later than 31 December 2006. We call on the Government of Sudan (GoS) to accept United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur and we call on the international community to urge the GoS to accept the transition of AMIS to a United Nations force.</DOC>

The issue of Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs), sometimes referred to as terminator technologies, was most recently considered under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) during the eighth Conference of the Parties (COP 8), which was held in Brazil from 20-31 March 2006.Yes. (i) The Australian delegation was led by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and included participation by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the South Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage. (ii) In relation to GURTs, the Australian delegation's position was to support the existing CBD recommendation made in 2000.There is no international ban or moratorium on the technology under the CBD. COP 8 reaffirmed Decision V/5 of the Fifth CBD Conference of the Parties (COP 5) held in Nairobi, Kenya from 15 - 26 May 2000. The COP 5 decision recommended that products incorporating such technologies should not be approved by Parties for field testing until appropriate scientific data can justify such testing, and for commercial use until appropriate, authorized and strictly controlled scientific assessments have been carried out.The Gene Technology Act 2000 provides a comprehensive system for regulating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Australia, to protect human health and the environment. Any application to release a GURT in Australia would be the subject of a scientific assessment of risks, on a case-by-case basis under the Gene Technology Act 2000, as is the case for any other GMO. This approach is consistent with the recommendations and decisions of the CBD.No. See (2) above.</DOC>

The CSHC is one of a small number of Australian Government concession cards that can be issued to people who are not receiving a social security payment, and is intended to support and encourage self-provision in retirement. The current CSHC income thresholds are $50,000 for singles and $80,000 combined for couples, with no assets test. Almost 85 per cent of people over Age Pension age qualify for an Australian Government concession card under the current arrangements. The CSHC income limits were indexed until 1999, when they were raised significantly, and indexation ceased. This increase to the limits was substantial  -  from $21,320 to $40,000 for singles, and from $35,620 to $67,000 combined for couples. In July 2001, the income limits were again increased to the current levels. If the CSHC income limits had remained linked to the CPI, they would now be $36,991 for a single person and $61,906 for a couple, far less than the current limits.</DOC>

and (b) The former Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) did not have an office in Geneva. Special Labour Advisers appointed by the Australian Government from 1973 to 1996 were officers of DIR seconded to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva. On 2 May 1996 the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Peter Reith MP, informed the House of Representatives that the Special Labour Adviser would be withdrawn from Geneva as a budget saving measure.and (f) The Department has not reopened or established an office in Geneva. The Australian Government decided in 2003 to engage more closely with the ILO. Against that background, funding was provided by Government through the 2005-06 additional estimates to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the Department) for the attachment of a Departmental officer to Australia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva to represent Australia's interests at the ILO. The funding formed part of the additional funding associated with the Government's workplace relations reforms. The Departmental officer is attached to Australia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva.No further staff have been engaged by Australia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva as a result of the Departmental officer being attached to the Mission.Consistent with the practice adopted in respect of the appointment of Senior Labour Advisers between 1973 and 1996, the Department gave careful consideration to the skills and expertise of senior departmental officers before selecting an officer well qualified to represent Australia's interests at the ILO.The appointment is for an initial period of two years with an option to extend to three years. The Departmental officer took up the appointment in August 2006.The projected annual operating cost of the Departmental officer attached to Australia's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva for each of the next three financial years is AUD62,150 per annum (excluding capital establishment costs) or AUD66,250 per annum (including capital establishment costs amortised over a 3 year period). Figures are unavailable for the fourth year as the appointment is for a period of up to three years.Other costs include the officer's remuneration package and a range of conditions and allowances. These conditions and allowances are consistent with those paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to officers posted overseas and vary depending on the officer's personal circumstances.The annual rent payable for the Departmental officer's residence is CHF 127,980, which at the current exchange rate is approximately AUD132,000 per annum. This provides accommodation of a standard commensurate with that provided for other Senior Executive Service officers at the Geneva post.</DOC>

I am aware of Chen Guangcheng's arrest and imprisonment in China.China's MFA has advised that Chen was tried for damaging property and blocking traffic in an incident on 11 March. I cannot confirm whether or not Chen in fact attended that protest.I am aware that the China Family Planning Agency has admitted that some forced abortions were carried out by local officials. I understand the agency promised disciplinary action, but I am not aware whether any punishments have been carried out in these cases.The Government regularly raises women's and children's rights during our annual human rights dialogues with China, including the issue of forced abortions.The Government regularly expresses to China our concerns about continuing shortcomings in China's legal system, including the lack of judicial independence. We do this through our annual human rights dialogues, and through our Embassy in Beijing.We also regularly raise our concern about China's use of torture, including to obtain evidence. We did this most recently at our human rights dialogue on 25 July 2006.Australia will raise Chen's case at the next human rights dialogue and on other appropriate occasions if it remains a case of concern. Australia raised Chen's case at this year's dialogue, and on two other occasions earlier this year.</DOC>

The Commissioner is aware that service arrangements have become an established part of ordinary business practice and can serve commercial purposes.Draft taxation ruling TR 2005/D5 has now been issued in final form as TR 2006/2. It explains the ATO view of the legal considerations involved in determining the deductibility of fees and charges paid to service entities. These legal principles, which are based on decisions of the courts, apply to service arrangements generally. These common principles apply to all professions, including medical practitioners. There is no basis on which to distinguish between professions in terms of the application of these legal principles.The draft booklet on service arrangements has now also been issued in final form. It provides practical guidance to help taxpayers decide whether payments made under their service arrangements are commercially realistic and reasonably connected to the main business. The booklet has been prepared around the common types of services that are provided by service entities. The guidance relevant to these services is considered common across professions. The booklet also provides two case studies that deal with medical practice arrangements that differ from conventional service arrangements. The ATO has worked with the Australian Medical Association to develop this specific guidance.There is no requirement for any taxpayer to restructure their business affairs because of the Commissioner's approach. Taxpayers can continue to use service arrangements, and continue to claim expenses that can be reasonably connected with services and benefits provided to the main business.Taxpayers across all professions are required to comply with taxation laws. Members of all professions should conduct their service arrangements in a manner compliant with relevant taxation laws.The Commissioner has and will continue to work with the medical profession to minimise any adverse individual and community effects that are associated with obligations on taxpayers to comply with tax laws. The ATO has worked with the Australian Medical Association to develop specific guidance for the medical profession already contained in the guide.Legal restrictions exist on divulging and communicating information on the affairs of taxpayers. Further, settlements reached with taxpayers contain standard confidentiality clauses that prevent the disclosure of details about the settlement.When settling disputes with taxpayers, the ATO operates pursuant to guidelines set out in the Commissioner's Code of Settlement Practice. Under these guidelines, regard is had to a range of factors in settling disputes.The Commissioner's booklet on service arrangements provides guidance on rates that the Commissioner accepts as commercially realistic. These rates are described as comparable market rates and are based on work undertaken during earlier audit and other compliance, risk and intelligence activities.There are also rates included as specific guidance for the medical profession in terms of medical practice arrangements that differ from conventional service arrangements, following consultation with the Australian Medical Association and a degree of independent verification. These rates are based on a fixed percentage of gross practice fees to calculate service fees, as opposed to a mark-up on costs approach. These rates can only be relied upon by general practitioners who operate under those unconventional arrangements. The risk of being audited will increase according to the degree of divergence above those rates.In 1996, work began to scope the risks associated with the use of service arrangements in the accounting and legal professions. In his 2000-01 Annual Report, the Commissioner identified concerns over the use of service arrangements in the accounting and legal professions. Prior to these concerns emerging, service arrangements were not the subject of systemic audit activity.ATO records at 30 June 2006 indicate the following information about audits and reviews of service arrangements:Size of businessNo. of audits1
No. adjustedLarge Business(over $100m turnover)2 completed3 cases finalised without further action2Nil2
Small BusinessSmall to Medium Enterprises (SME) ($2m-100m turnover)1 completed2 cases finalised without further action1Nil2

Micro (up to $2m turnover)17 completed3 in progressNil2
50% on salaries and 15% on non-salary expenses,30% on all expenses.A gross mark-up is considered inappropriate where it cannot be reasonably associated with net profit margins comparable to arm's length arrangements as set out in the Commissioner's booklet.The same gross mark-up figure can be acceptable in one arrangement and not be acceptable in another. This depends on the nature and extent of the business activity of the service entity and the expenses that it meets or expects to meet out of these mark-ups in carrying on these business activities.(11) Taxation ruling TR 2006/2 (previously released in draft as TR 2005/D5) supplements existing Ruling IT 276 and is not a departure from the existing law or from the Commissioner's administration in relation to service arrangements. Accordingly, the release of the ruling is not expected to have an appreciable or systemic impact on the supply or profitability of medical services.The Commissioner has given taxpayers 12 months to review their service arrangements. During this time, only the highest risk cases will be subject to audit activity. For this purpose, the Commissioner has announced that he will be looking at cases where the service fees paid are over $1 million, represent over 50% of the gross fees earned by the professional practice, and the net profit of the service entity is over 50% of the combined net profit of the entities involved.The Commissioner will also look at cases where there are serious doubts as to whether the services were actually provided by the service entity.Any changes made to existing arrangements to support their compliance with tax laws are not expected to affect adversely the profitability of medical enterprises.</DOC>

The NEVSF provides grants for projects that boost the recruitment, retention and training of volunteer organisations at the frontline of emergency management.The R&amp;I Program is intended to fund projects that enhance community safety. The four priority areas for research are currently:1. Building individual and community resilience2. Risk perception, including warnings and community action3. Innovations in disaster mitigation4. Methods for assessing disaster impacts, including long term, social and economic           effects.(b)   Responsibility for deciding the priority of applications made under the LGS and NEVSF is taken by a State/Territory Selection Committee formed within each jurisdiction and comprising a representative of the State/Territory's emergency management organisation, local government (for LGS), emergency volunteer organisations (NEVSF), and EMA. The Committees assess and rank applications based on that State or Territory's priorities. A composite priority list, comprising the individual State and Territory priority lists are submitted to me for approval. The Community Development Branch within EMA is responsible for the preparation and management of funding agreements between the Commonwealth and grant recipients.Applications for the R&amp;I Program are assessed by a panel of independent experts with expertise in both emergency management and the priority areas identified. The final decision on which projects are to be funded is taken by the Director General EMA, based on the recommendations made by the assessment panel.(4)   and (5) The first full year of operation of both the LGS and NEVSF was 2005-06 and accordingly, no community organisations, businesses or individuals in the Newcastle electoral division received funding for projects through either program in the 2003-04 or 2004-05 financial years.No community organisations, businesses or individuals in the Newcastle electoral division received funding for projects through the R&amp;I program in either the 2003-04 or 2004-05 financial years.</DOC>

People and organisations in the electoral division of Chifley can apply for assistance directly from the Australian Government under these schemes. It has been a long - standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys - General, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence and not to provide information in relation to individual applications. The practice developed in order to protect information supplied by applicants which would be covered by solicitor - client confidentiality and in order to comply with obligations imposed by the Privacy Act 1988.

The Local Grants Scheme is aimed at local governments to assist them in enhancing community safety, including that of indigenous communities and, by extension, of individuals.The four year initiative was announced in 2004 in recognition of the need to develop self-reliance at both the community and local government level to enhance community safety.For the 2005-06 financial year $14.4 million was appropriated for these grants nationally however, no funding has been provided for the people of the electoral division of Chifley since the program's inception in financial year 2004-05.The program has a national focus and is intended to benefit all eligible communities including indigenous communities. Local government agencies within the electorate of Chifley are eligible to apply for grants to assist in enhancement of community safety.</DOC>

All terminated Ansett employees have received 100% of their outstanding SEESA entitlements. Where former employees have entitlements in excess of the assistance already provided by the Australian Government under SEESA, their entitlements remain the responsibility of the Ansett Administrators.The Air Passenger Ticket Levy was administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. The distribution of the ticket levy is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.This is a matter for SEES Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank to answer.The Australian Government's primary objective was to put in place a mechanism to ensure that Ansett employees received their entitlements under SEESA in a timely and efficient manner. A further objective was that this mechanism should be designed in a way that would minimise its impact on the budget.No. SEESA has met the objectives set by the Australian Government.See answer to Question (1).</DOC>

Australia's opposition to the death penalty is well known. In addition to co-sponsorship of an annual resolution on the death penalty at the former UN Commission on Human Rights, Australia has raised this issue with many of the countries we reported on in our answer to No. 3906 since August of last year.Regarding the conditions and results of our interventions, while we do not have information available that directly links a death penalty commutation to our efforts in every case, we do know that in some instances, our efforts have been successful.For example, we have made representations on four cases in Vietnam in recent years- An Australian citizen was arrested on 16 June 2003 and charged with illegally trading in narcotics and sentenced to death. An application for Presidential clemency, supported by a letter from myself, was made in August 2005. Senator Ellison also wrote to his counterpart in Vietnam, and personal representations were made by Prime Minister Howard to the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Mr Billson also raised the issue with the Vietnamese Government during a visit to Vietnam in 2005. His application for clemency was granted on 30 December 2005.- A Vietnamese citizen and Australian permanent resident was arrested in December 2002 for illegally trading narcotics and sentenced to death. An appeal for clemency to the President, supported by myself, was submitted in August 2005. Senator Ellison also wrote to his counterpart in Vietnam, and personal representations were made by Prime Minister Howard to the Prime Minister of Vietnam. Mr Billson also raised the issue with the Vietnamese Government during a visit to Vietnam in 2005. His death sentence was commuted to life early in January 2006.- An Australian citizen received a death sentence in 2002 for drug trafficking. She made a request for clemency on 27 December 2002. The Prime Minister and I made representations to the Vietnamese authorities on her case. Her death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment on 8 July 2003.- An Australian citizen arrested on 2 July 2003 in Ho Chi Minh City for illegal trading of a narcotic received a death sentence. His appeal for clemency was supported by the Prime Minister and myself. In August 2005 the President of Vietnam commuted his sentence to life imprisonment.The Australian Government will continue to encourage those countries that impose the death penalty to commit to the principles espoused in the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</DOC>

APRA has advised that within its Insight publication, it has ceased publishing separate statistics for Lenders Mortgage Insurers (LMIs) as a sector within Direct Insurers to avoid possible breaches of APRA's confidentiality obligations. LMI data is included in the 'other' category for assets, liabilities and the performance measure tables. However, mortgage insurance is still reported as a separate class of business in the revenue and expense tables.There are four profit measures published in Insight, calculated using figures reported in the APRA returns as follows:Profit from general insurance (underwriting result + investment income + other operating revenue  -  operating expenses) as a percentage of net premium revenue (premium revenue  -  outwards reinsurance expense)Operating profit (profit from general insurance  -  goodwill amortisation  -  income tax) as a percentage of total revenue (premium revenue + investment income + other operating revenue)Operating profit as a percentage of shareholders equity (average of opening and closing balances)Operating profit as a percentage of total assets (average of opening and closing balances)and (4) Current profit/loss ratios for LMI are not comparable to periods prior to 1 July 2002. At that time, APRA changed its reporting regime to a prospective basis which removed the unearned premium and deferred acquisition cost components of AASB1023 and replaced those with a requirement to provide for premium liabilities (PL). PL recognises claims that have not yet been incurred but are expected to be incurred over the remaining period of the current book of business. Premium income figures also changed as a result of APRA's new reporting regime. Premium income from that date needed to be fully recognised when written on a prospective basis from the date of acceptance of the contract rather than on an earned basis as required by AASB1023. This change increased premium income in comparison to prior years. The below enables calculations for each of the profit measures on a year-by-year basis to facilitate comparison. Data has not been provided for the 2002 and 2003 years as these figures are distorted by the one-off effects of change in reporting requirements.Given the change referred to above, caution should be exercised when making direct comparisons between periods after and before 1 July 2002. There is a large negative incurred claims figure for the 2004 year which resulted from revaluation of the reserves created in 2002 and 2003 and which is not necessarily indicative of normal claims activity.(i)Item ($'000)19951994199319921991Gross Premium revenuea65,02362,83154,10127,327naNet Premium revenuea49,96742,90738,30724,05631,550Gross Claims incurred21,7659,58440,26284,314naNet claims incurred15,14211,16023,77237,33219,721(ii)Item ($'000)20001999199819971996Gross Premium revenuea170,762108,22281,26138,87968,106Net Premium revenuea120,88582,01060,10229,74056,880Gross Claims incurred29,08717,02120,26114,56750,520Net claims incurred21,92812,45114,2259,09840,566(iii)Item ($'000)20052004200320022001Gross Premium revenuea

Any new entrant would have to meet the same prudential requirements that apply to LMIs currently operating in the Australian market. These requirements provide for financial stability and consumer protection in the insurance sector.Australia's prudential framework aims to treat the same risks in the same way regardless of the institution or industry sector. Regulation should not artificially favour or disadvantage any particular section of the market  - the same risks should be regulated in the same way regardless of the institution holding that risk or the type of instrument being used. As outlined in the answer to Question 7, under new arrangements, prudential requirements for LMIs are more appropriately aligned with the risks that they face and with other institutions with the same risks.</DOC>

Due to delays in preparing and finalising contract/tender documentation the positions will be advertised in October 2006.Funding for these two positions was initially only guaranteed until 30 June 2006. Further funding through to 2008-09 is now confirmed and the positions will be advertised. Defence Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Service specialist advice has been provided by the ATODS Clinical Coordinator (a nurse practitioner with post-graduate Alcohol and Other Drugs qualifications), a part-time specialist Alcohol and Other Drugs consultant (through until the end of financial year 2005-06) and a specialist psychiatrist.The contracts that are being developed will ensure that appropriately experienced and qualified ATODS professionals are contracted to the National Coordinator and Training Coordinator positions. The Australian Defence Force will thus have a highly experienced and qualified core of ATODS professionals to provide best practice ATODS policy, training and service to all Australian Defence Force personnel.</DOC>

The only programme funded under the New Apprenticeship Access Program (now the Australian Apprenticeships Access Programme) line of Output 2.2 is the Australian Apprenticeships Access Programme (The Access Programme). This programme offers disadvantaged jobseekers a pathway to an Australian Apprenticeship or employment or further education and training. The Access Programme provides pre-vocational training, job search assistance and post-placement support in the workplace. The pre-vocational training must be drawn from a qualification that leads to an Australian Apprenticeship pathway.The Australian Government contracts brokers to provide the Access Programme services, who may then sub-contract providers. Brokers and providers run training courses in a number of industry areas, including the traditional trades, aged care, retail, child care, hospitality and business administration. Brokers are contracted to a specific value of commencements and outcomes to be achieved within the contract period, usually two to three years. Brokers are only paid for the commencements and outcomes they achieve within the contract period and they are expected to run at least one course in each designated site in each region for which they have contracted places. However, funding is not related to the specific courses, but rather overall contracted commencements and outcomes.Funding has been provided for 9,500 commencements annually in the programme. Over 6,000 commencements have been achieved in the programme in the current calendar year and over 8,000 in the last financial year. It has delivered over 7,000 apprenticeship, employment or further training outcomes since the beginning of the 2002/03 financial year.The Budget estimate for the Access Programme for the current financial year (2006/07) is $27,587,000. (b) The figures for the forward estimates period are $26,939,000 for 2007/08, $26,006,000 for 2008/09 and $24,199,000 for 2009/10.</DOC>

To ensure Australia's continued diplomatic representation, Heads of Missions positions are never vacant as letters of recall are only prosecuted when letters of credential for a subsequent Head of Mission are presented. The position of (a) Ambassador to France, (b) Ambassador to the United States and (c) the High Commissioner to United Kingdom have not been advertised. There are no generic selection criteria for Heads of Mission positions. Appointments for (a) Ambassador to France and (c) the High Commissioner to United Kingdom have been announced.The Minister for Foreign Affairs can recommend to the Prime Minister any suitably appropriate candidate for a diplomatic appointment. Once the Prime Minister has agreed to a candidate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs then recommends the candidate to the Governor-General. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is not required to consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on his recommendations for diplomatic appointments.Heads of Mission Diplomatic appointments are announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs following agreement by the Governor-General in Executive Council, and the host government to the recommended candidate. Consequently, the timing of announcements cannot be predicted.Ambassador to France. Announced on 14 January 2005.Ambassador to the United States.

The access card will be phased in over a two year period beginning in 2008. This new card will be available across Australia and will replace the Medicare Smartcard.Any type of digital information can be stored on the Medicare smartcard such as images, text and digital certificates. The quantity of information that can be stored is only limited by the size of the chip.The information currently stored on the Medicare smartcard is the same as that stored on the standard Medicare card, with an option for customers to store their photograph on the chip if they choose to do so. There are mechanisms, under Medicare Australia's existing legislation that would enable additional information, such as emergency contact details and allergies information, to be stored on a voluntary basis on the Medicare smartcard.At present the Medicare smartcard cannot be used to access any information other than what is held on the card itself.The data held on the Medicare smartcard is stored on both the magnetic stripe on the back of the card as well as on the chip, with an option for customers to store their photograph on the chip if they choose to do so. Access to the data stored on the magnetic stripe of the Medicare smartcard is the same as it is for the standard Medicare card. The data stored on the chip can only be accessed by the card holder placing the card into one of the kiosks located in the seven Medicare offices in Tasmania.The currency of the information held on the Medicare smartcard is dependent on customers keeping Medicare Australia advised of information changes.The security features on the chip require the use of a digital certificate to make any changes to the information held. This digital certificate is only held by Medicare Australia.The Medicare smartcard currently has the same functionality as the standard Medicare card and is compatible with existing magnetic stripe card readers used by health professionals to access the stored data on the magnetic stripe.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 22 hours at an estimated cost of $1280.</DOC>

There is no policy of administrative detention called 'catch, kiss and release'. The Fisheries Management Act provides for legislative forfeiture and this is used in limited circumstances.The Minister does not confirm the estimates indicated in the question. It would be impossible to confirm or provide estimates as the nature of sightings cannot be used as a basis to determine a 'success rate'.In areas of concentrated surveillance the same vessel may be sighted by successive flights on the same or subsequent days. Additionally, vessels sighted may also include those that could be fishing lawfully or are legitimately transiting Australian waters.,  (b) and (c). During the recent Budget process, the Australian Government set a forecast of Foreign Fishing Vessel apprehensions for the purposes of operational planning and resource allocation; however agencies will continue to apprehend as many illegal foreign fishing vessels as possible, irrespective of whether those apprehensions would result in the nominated figures being exceeded.The performance information is detailed in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2006/07 (Attorney-General's Portfolio).</DOC>

In April 2005, I had agreed with the Indonesian Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Dr Hamid Awaludin, that Australia and Indonesia would commence discussions about a bilateral treaty. In August and October 2005, I again met with Dr Awaludin to discuss the ITP scheme.On 16 February 2006 I wrote to Dr Awaludin requesting clarification about the domestic processes required to give effect to a treaty in Indonesia.On 29 June 2006, the Attorney-General, Hon Philip Ruddock MP, and Dr Awaludin agreed on key points on the proposed treaty including the following:- the agreement will cover all offences- the agreement will apply to prisoners already in custody in either Australia or Indonesia- the agreement will provide that a prisoner will serve the sentence imposed by the laws of the country in which the person was convicted- the agreement will not apply to people facing the death penalty unless that penalty is commuted to a prison sentence, and- the agreement will set up a framework for decisions to be made about individual cases on a case by case basis.On 13 September 2006, the Hon Philip Ruddock and I sent a joint letter to Dr Awaludin confirming the desirability of concluding negotiations by the end of 2006.On 9 October 2006 the Hon Philip Ruddock MP, and I both held meetings in Canberra with where a number of outstanding issues were agreed.In June 2005 and December 2005 officials from the Attorney-General's Department travelled to Indonesia and discussed the ITP regime and the possibility of negotiating a bilateral treaty between Australia and Indonesia. On 10 and 11 August 2006, officials from the Attorney - General's Department again visited Indonesia for discussions.The ITP scheme was discussed with Indonesian Government officials during a visit to Australia in July 2004.Details of any treaty discussions and negotiations are confidential between the parties until a treaty is signed.Dialogue between Australia and Indonesia about an ITP treaty is active and continuing. Ministers at the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum in Bali in June 2006 announced that it was desirable that a treaty be signed this year.</DOC>

Testimony provided by Mr Bashford at the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee in May 2006 was prefaced by the statement that final decisions on the design and operation of the access card had not been made. The final design of the card will be undertaken in consultation with the Lead Advisor, Chief Technology Architect and the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce headed by Professor Allan Fels, AO.Pending advice from the Lead Advisor, Chief Technology Architect and the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce, the access card will have a digital photograph on the face of the card and in the chip. The chip will also contain the names of dependants to facilitate Medicare billing and rebates in the same way that dependants are currently embossed on the face of the current Medicare cards.Although the collection of signatures is a common occurrence in doing business with private and public organisations, for historical reasons, they have generally been captured in paper-format. People registering for the health and social services access card will be fully informed about the use of the digital signature.Every cardholder and dependant will have a unique access card number. Whether the card itself has a unique identifier is a technical design issue that will be considered by Government in due course.The final data elements have not been decided. Advice will be sought from the Lead Advisor, Chief Technology Architect and Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce.The Government is examining what legislation is required to ensure the successful implementation of the access card. The specifics will be dependant upon business processes and technical specifications which are not yet finalised.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 3 hours at an estimated cost of $183.</DOC>

No, this is not true.For the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991 a marriage-like relationship exists if two people of the opposite sex, who are not close relatives, are considered to be living together as husband and wife. The Act requires the application of a test based on five factors to determine whether or not a marriage-like relationship exists.In determining the nature of a relationship Centrelink will consider the following five factors:1.     financial aspects of the relationship;2.     nature of the household;3.     social aspects of the relationship;4.     presence or absence of a sexual relationship; and5.     nature of the commitment.Any decision taken to determine that a marriage-like relationship exists must be supported by adequate evidence.Section 4 (6) of the Act makes provision for certain customers to not be considered as a member of a couple. These may be those assessed under the provisions of Section 24 and certain Youth Allowance customers.No, the Minister does not accept this assertion.If Centrelink accepts that a person is single, they would not be treated as a member of a couple by using another person's income and assets in their assessment. As in question (1), the question would not be asked about the other person's income and assets.A person who is sharing accommodation as a single might be defined as a 'sharer' and receive the sharer rate of rent assistance. The sharer rate of rent assistance is less than the normal rate because the person does not pay all the rent themselves. However, that rent assistance is still unaffected by the income and assets of other tenants.No. Section 4 (2) of the Social Security Act provides the definition of a 'couple' and Centrelink applies the provisions of this legislation and associated policy in undertaking any assessment of relationship status.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 2 hours and 46 minutes at an estimated cost of $156.</DOC>

Between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2005, there were 7,530 reports by Coastwatch aircraft and Defence assets of sightings of vessels in the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone suspected of being in breach of fisheries laws. This figure does not, however represent the actual number of vessels fishing illegally as, in areas of concentrated aerial surveillance, the same vessel may be sighted and counted by multiple flights. It should be noted that vessels sighted may also include those that could be fishing lawfully or are legitimately transiting Australian waters. Of the sightings reports, 839 vessels were confirmed as fishing illegally.Of the 839 vessels, 414 were apprehended and 3226 crew were detained. The remaining 425 had all of their catch and fishing equipment destroyed.Of the 414 vessels that were apprehended, 63 were released on payment of bonds.</DOC>

The Mature Age Worker Tax Offset was implemented on 1 July 2004. Processing of income tax returns relating to the 2004/05 income year is not yet complete. For income tax returns relating to the 2004/05 income year, processed by 30 June 2006:Around 1,034,000 individual taxpayers had claimed the mature age worker tax offset;9.55% of total individuals have claimed the offset; andIndividual taxpayers were allowed around $437 million of Mature Age Worker Tax Offset., (ii) and (iii) Details of claims for the entrepreneurs tax offset (ETO) will not be available until tax returns for the income year ending 30 June 2006 have been lodged. This is because the ETO first applies to tax assessments for the income year that commences on or after 1 July 2005.More than 600,000 taxpayers have elected into the simplified tax system since its introduction. As a result of legislative changes to or associated with the STS which came into effect from 1 July 2005, (i.e. accrual accounting method, entrepreneurs tax offset and shortened period of review), we expect to see an increase in take-up when 2006 income tax returns are lodged.The Review of Business Taxation  -  A Tax System Redesigned (July 1999) says (at page 74) 'Over 95 percent of businesses have annual turnover below $1million representing 850,000.' Costings used in the report were based on the assumption that 60% of these taxpayers would take up the option of a simplified tax system. It was not expected that all eligible taxpayers would benefit from the STS or elect into it.Whilst the STS has reduced costs from the outset, the Government has continued to respond to community feedback and has modified the system to increase both its accessibility and its benefits.The ATO did contact a number of accountants who were not recommending the STS to their clients to understand their concerns. One major concern was that the STS previously required taxpayers to adopt a cash accounting system whilst financiers required accrual accounts to be kept for their purposes. The system has since been changed to allow the use of either the case or accruals accounting method.The simplified tax system was originally promoted to all businesses through the media and targeted education of tax practitioners.The ATO has released a broad range of products on the simplified tax system to assist taxpayers and practitioners. These are available on the ATO web site; www.ato.gov.au , and many are available in paper form.Products included a decision support tool STS  -  is it for you to help taxpayers asses their eligibility and calculate the potential benefits from electing into the simplified tax system.Further promotion of the simplified tax system and the entrepreneurs tax offset was undertaken in May and June 2006. Tax agents and related intermediaries were the major focus of this campaign, and supportive promotional activities such as placing advertorials in the Taxation Institute of Australia's Taxation in Australia Journal and Tax Agent Newsletter published on the ATO's website at www.ato.gov.au, as well as presentations in the ATO's June 2006 Satellite Seminar were undertaken. All simplified tax system and Tax Time 2006 products were updated and a specific fact sheet on the entrepreneurs tax offset was incorporated into both product sets.Amounts spent on media campaigns were $280,000 in 2002 and $250,000 in 2003.Product and staffing costs are part of the ATO's day to day operational costs and have not been separately quantified.The Government announced a number of measures in the 2006-07 Budget to assist small businesses by improving the alignment of eligibility thresholds for small business concessions and increasing access to the STS and small business capital gains tax (CGT) concessions. The measures include changes to:increase the STS average annual turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million and remove the $3 million depreciating assets test from the STS eligibility requirements.increase the net assets threshold from $5 million to $6 million for the CGT small business concessions and allow STS taxpayers to be eligible for the concessions without having to satisfy the net assets threshold;increase the cash accounting turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million for the goods and services tax (GST) concessions for small businesses and align certain GST definitions of turnover with the STS definition; andallow STS taxpayers to pay quarterly pay as you go instalments on the basis of GDP-adjusted notional tax.</DOC>

The Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) administers a wide range of programs and services available to Indigenous communities and individuals. A summary of DOHA's health programs and initiatives for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be found on the department's website at:http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/Content/health-oatsih-pubs-progsum.This webpage provides details of progress on the implementation of DOHA's Indigenous specific and non specific health programs impacting upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.The Department's Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) provides funding for the following programs available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the electorate of Chifley:Bringing Them HomePrimary Health Care ServicesChild and Maternal HealthMental HealthSubstance UseGeneral Practice Education and Training (GPET) has developed a Framework for General Practice Training in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health.

This national program includes Daruk Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) which is located in Mt Druitt in the electorate of Chifley.GPET also reimburses the salaries of General Practice Registrars undertaking a training term in an AMS through funding provided by DoHA from the Medicare Training Pool. This funding is provided to assist the registrar undertaking training, the Daruk AMS in the electorate of Chifley, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are clients of Daruk AMS.(2)   (a)   (i) In 2004-05, the department spent $265.5 million on Outcome 7  -  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health. Of the Indigenous programs that are available in Chifley, the department spent $161.3 million nationally in the 2004-05 financial year (see Attachment A).

This amount includes funding for training as part of the Framework for General Practice Training in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, and the reimbursement of annual salaries of General Practice Registrars undertaking a training term in an AMS.(ii) It is not appropriate to provide funding information on Indigenous programs at the electorate level as this data may compromise the financial privacy of some community groups and/or individuals.(b)   (i) At the 2001 Census, approximately 2.2 per cent of the Australian population identified as Indigenous.(ii) The electorate of Chifley has an estimated population of 150,400 as at 30 June 2004.

The MOU does contain conditions relating to the transportation of live animals.The MOU does not contain information relating to slaughter practices.The MOU does contain information to the extent that it obliges members to follow measures as outlined under the World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines for animal welfare.The MOU on the Trade in Live Animals is an arrangement between governments and sets out a variety of commitments. The Australian Government and the Middle East signatories are committed to the content of the MOU, and whilst considered politically and morally binding, it is not a treaty and as such does not have legal force.Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon.Negotiations for the MOU will be completed as soon as is feasible.Australia, like all members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE), is working to ensure animals are treated humanely and is determined to do its part to eliminate cruelty to animals. The Australian government and livestock export industry take animal welfare issues very seriously and have been working with countries in the Middle East to support efforts to improve animal handling and facilities, from offloading at the port until the point of slaughter.If the MOU were activated, inspections would be carried out upon the consent of both parties.The government has been kept informed of animal welfare concerns in Middle East markets. The government has suspended the live animal trade to Egypt pending agreement concerning the post-arrival animal welfare and handling of Australian live animals imported into Egypt. The resident Australian government veterinarian based in the Middle East is actively engaging key trading partners on animal welfare issues.See 3(c).</DOC>

The responsibility for the x-ray of checked passenger luggage (both international and domestic) rests with the airlines. As such, the Australian Customs Service does not keep this type of information. The relevant policy department is Transport and Regional Services who will be able to assist in answering this question.During the 2005 calendar year, Customs inspected (X-rayed) 138,136 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) nationally. Inspections occurred at the Container Examination Facilities (CEFs) in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle and Adelaide, and at the Container Examination Building in Darwin. The facilities Customs has built integrate x-ray with physical examination, other law enforcement and regulatory agency activity, and the necessary interactions with industry. The Customs facilities also integrate x-ray with a range of other technologies. In addition to a powerful container x-ray, the facilities utilise pallet and mobile x-ray units, ion scan technology, detector dogs, and radiation chemical warfare agent detectors. Between the container examination initiative commencing in November 2002 and 31 July 2006, over 393,000 TEUs have been x-rayed. Prior to the container x-ray strategy, between 4,000 and 5,000 TEU per annum were examined by the equivalent area in Customs. Customs continues to risk assess all sea cargo entering Australia.Customs Standard Operating Procedures stipulate that a hand-held radiation detector is used at each CEF to measure radiation levels when containers are checked in for an X-ray. Customs intends conducting trials of radiation portal technology in the 2006-07 financial year.</DOC>

,  (c), (e) My Department provided advice on a variety of options for the allocation of this funding, including an open tender process. I accepted the advice that providing the funding to AbaF to manage would be the most efficient and effective use of the funding. AbaF already provides business training around Australia through a number of programs that provide practical skills for arts organisations and individual artists. As well as assisting arts organisations in securing partnerships and philanthropic support, AbaF also conducts seminars by experienced professionals on a range of business essentials. AbaF therefore has the capacity to move quickly to modify its existing offering and to develop especially tailored modules. AbaF will be consulting with key stakeholders in the visual arts sector to ensure that the training package accurately reflects the needs of visual artists across the country.AbaF is well positioned to ensure the training is delivered on a national scale, through its existing network of State offices. Using existing structures and resources will reduce start-up costs and time, thereby maximising the results the initiative can achieve in this financial year. AbaF is also singularly well placed to expand the effect of this funding through its existing partnerships with business.The ability to provide value for money, existing infrastructure and expertise to deliver training on a national scale, and the potential to leverage extra value from the funding received.and (g) No.</DOC>

Six.The AFP has 22 explosive detection canines, comprising 16 Counter Terrorism First Response and six specifically trained for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) duties.20 canines are in pre-course development assessing their suitability to undertake a full training course. Six canines will be assigned to new APEC handlers at the conclusion of the handler's course in December 2006.An APEC course for sworn handlers runs for 12 weeks. Ongoing training is required post-course to induct new canine handling teams into the operational areas.The estimated cost per operational canine at the completion of all training is $90,000.Cost distribution includes purchase of the canine, training aids, veterinary expenses and specialised canine equipment. This figure also contains a contribution to the cost of conducting a course and support infrastructure for the canine teams.Eight years.Three primary categories of explosive and then specific compounds within each category. The numbers of compounds within each category is:Powders - Two;Commercial explosives - Four; andMilitary explosives - Three.This will vary on a case by case situation, with consideration to climate, canine attitude, search difficulty (terrain) and the specific search requirements. Searches can take 5 - 20 minutes, but if required can deploy for hours. There is nothing to preclude a canine team from working a 24 hour period, provided suitable breaks are allowed to ensure the canine maintains its determination.</DOC>

I refer the honourable member to my response to questions HS48-50 asked by Senator Evans on 1st November 2005.
At that time I advised the Senator that there is no category of stress leave. Therefore no staff of the department or its agencies are on this type of leave.
To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes at an estimated cost of $101.

The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs administers a wide variety of programs to assist individuals and communities. Information about programs administered by the department is regularly published on the department's website and is publicly available at www.facsia.gov.au and in the department's Annual Reports and Portfolio Budget Statements. In addition details of contracts, including funding agreements, to the value of $100,000 or more are published on the department's website at regular intervals, in accordance with Senate Order 192.I consider that the preparation of answers to the questions placed on notice would involve a significant diversion of resources and, in the circumstances, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified.</DOC>

Depending on the timeframe in which claims are made by companies under the Ethanol Production Grant Program, there are instances where claims are received in a particular month but are not able to be processed and paid until the following month.Tarac Technologies Pty Ltd made a claim for a grant under the Ethanol Production Grant Program after the June 2006 financial close for processing claims under this program. Therefore the grant to Tarac Technologies Pty Ltd was paid in July 2006, rather than in June 2006.</DOC>

Data by federal electorate is not available.Data on the number of Year 12 completers who commenced at a higher education institution is available from the public higher education statistics collections, specifically Students: Selected Higher Education Statistics. These may be found at http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/higher_education/publications_resources/statistics/publications_higher_education_statistics_collections.htmfor the years 1997 to 2004 and from the hard copy publications for previous years.Equivalent information at institutional level for vocational and technical education is not available. These data fall under protocols between the National Centre for Vocational Education Research and the States and Territories which govern the Australian Vocational Education and Training Management Information System (AVETMIS) collections.Data by State and Territory for the years 1997 to 2004 is shown in Table 1 below for Year 12 completers commencing higher education, and in Table 2 below for Year 12 completers commencing vocational and technical education. Interpretation is subject to the caveats in the notes to the tables. Note that the results in Tables 1 and 2 cannot be directly added. Some students may have enrolled in both higher education and vocational and technical education courses. Also, Table 1 is based on State or Territory of the student's home residence, while Table 2 is based on State or Territory of the provider.The data show an overall increase of 5.9% between 1997 and 2004 in the number of domestic Year 12 completers going on to university or vocational and technical education immediately after leaving school, but a decline of 5.1% between 2000 and 2004. This recent decline reflects primarily three factors.The strong labour market creates additional options for young people. The proportion of Year 12 completers in employment straight after leaving school increased from 24% to 29% during in the decade to 2006.The expansion of Australian Apprenticeships. The number of 15-19 year olds with Year 12 commencing an Australian Apprenticeship increased by 127% from 1996 to 2005 (19,000 to 43,200).Many young people go later into education and training. Around 9% of Year 12 completers take a gap year before commencing university. Further, the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth (LSAY) indicates that the percentage of young people who were in Year 9 in 1995 who had attended university at some time increased from 31% at a modal age of 19 to 49% at a modal age of 24.Regardless of when they leave school, young people's participation in education and training has risen over the last decade. On Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Labour Force Survey figures, in the ten years to July 2006 the proportion of 15 to 19 year olds in school or full time tertiary education increased from 67% to 70%. For 20-24 year olds the proportion rose from 16% to 25%. Table 1 Number and proportion of Year 12 completers commencing higher education at bachelor level or below in the year after completing Year 12 or in the same year, by State and Territory of home residence, by year in which the higher education course commenced19971998199920002001200220032004StateNo%No%No%No%No%No%No%No%NSW20 18536.421 20938.922 41334.322 72439.521 01236.121 22436.419 69732.618 66828.9VIC20 17146.620 46045.519 66145.119 10343.018 49241.218 46139.317 69836.617 21935.6QLD12 09537.412 16136.412 42135.711 96432.712 57932.913 72236.212 77432.812 50232.1SA4 80239.55 02340.35 55742.44 51833.55 23437.95 39838.04 99234.44 89734.0WA6 41641.46 13244.46 41438.36 18736.45 97134.06 19334.95 80031.65 76530.6TAS1 43631.31 54130.11 57331.91 52329.01 45327.91 60832.61 51030.41 53626.4NT18117.424122.7774.328412.528234.228834.028222.823527.9ACT1 36935.11 46134.01 34933.31 30433.91 16329.71 20031.882621.51 22431.7unknown796623541550410393346371AUS67 45339.968 85140.470 00837.668 15437.566 60436.368 48436.963 92133.462 42331.8Notes:a.

The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimates that the gross value of production of the cattle industry for the 2005-06 financial year was $7.4 billion.ABARE collects fisheries production data from Commonwealth fisheries and State and Territory fisheries on an annual basis. The most recent information available on Australian fisheries production is for the 2004-05 year. 2005-06 data will not be available until April-May 2007.In 2004-05, Australian fishing production, including pearl production, was valued at $2.048 billion.In 2004-05, Australian pearl production was valued at A$122 million. Note: This figure for pearl production will significantly underestimate the total value of pearl production in Australia because data from the Northern Territory is not included in the total for confidentiality reasons. Australian Pearl exports were valued at A$291 million in 2004-05.(2)   There have been numerous Government reports on biosecurity threats to Australia's primary industries since 1996.

The Department does record the number of people approved to receive aged care but who have not yet entered care. However, not all people with an approval are actively seeking to enter aged care, so we do not know how many can reasonably be said to be waiting for care.</DOC>

Eligibility for Family Tax Benefit is based on a family's adjusted taxable income. Adjusted taxable income includes taxable income, fringe benefits, net rental property losses, tax - free government pensions and benefits, and foreign income, less any child support paid.Family Tax Benefit is designed to direct assistance to those families most in need and assessment on adjusted taxable income is considered to be a fair, objective and equitable way of determining a family's relative financial need.Dividend payments from the Ansett Administrators to former Ansett employees are taxable income in the tax year that the payments are received, and are therefore included as income for Family Tax Benefit in that tax year. Any further dividend payments will not be included until the tax year in which those payments are received.If the dividend payments were not included as income for Family Tax Benefit, these families would receive greater financial benefit than other families with the same adjusted taxable income. The Australian Government considers that this could be seen as involving different treatment for some families, and as being inconsistent with the targeting of payments according to relative need.</DOC>

The figure quoted from Defence was based on the average cost of the F-22 over the entire production. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) cost was based on a smaller window towards the end of production and thus is less expensive, that is, it is based on the program maturing. However, the ASPI report also stated that this figure was the minimum purchase cost for the United States (US) and that Australia would incur additional costs. (These would include development costs associated with making the aircraft available for export, Foreign Military Sales surcharges, recoupment charges for initial research and development, upgrades to radar and other systems).The figure was derived from multiple open-sourced US Government documents. These included the US Government Accountability Office (primarily documents 05-304 and 05-390T), US Department of Defence Budget document (Air Force 2006/2007 Budget Estimate  -  Aircraft Procurement) and the US Selected Acquisition Report (September 2005).The average procurement cost for the F-22 is still approximately US$175 million in 2006 dollars. As noted above, however, this is the price for the US only and additional charges would apply for any export customer.Escalation in the average unit procurement cost for the JSF would occur if the program incurs significant schedule slips and/or reductions to numbers produced. That said, the impact of any change to the JSF is ameliorated by the large number of aircraft in the JSF Program, expected to be approximately 20 times the size of the F-22 program.</DOC>

With effect from 27 March 2006, the Australian Government established the Office of Workplace Services (OWS) as an independent agency with an expanded scope to monitor workplaces and provide information, education and compliance services to employees and employers under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. On this basis, references in Ms Grierson's questions to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are being read as references to the OWS.Cash-in-hand matters are primarily the responsibility of the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink. OWS' policy is to refer suspected breaches of taxation and social security laws to the appropriate agency.OWS' responsibility in this area is to ensure that employees are paid in accordance with the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and that employers comply with record their keeping requirements under the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006. The details of referrals to OWS on such matters are not routinely collected.N/AThis information is not available as the date of birth of employees is not routinely collected.This breakdown cannot be provided for the reasons outlined above. However, since OWS was established as an independent agency on 27 March 2006, it has recovered in excess of $2.5 million for over 2,300 employees. Four prosecutions (matters/decisions pending) have been commenced during this period. OWS has also assisted 66 employees to obtain the recovery of underpayments though small claims actions.</DOC>

From 1 October 2004 to 31 August 2006 the ATO has found 43 cases of ATO officers accessing taxpayer records where they were not authorised to do so.Over the same period, 917 taxpayers have had their records accessed inappropriately. Two cases account for accesses to 517 of these taxpayers' records.The ATO takes very seriously its responsibilities for ensuring that taxpayer information is protected. The ATO employs a three-pronged approach involving education, detection and investigation.The ATO's systems have comprehensive audit trails and both reactive and proactive investigations are conducted to identify unauthorised access and/or modification of taxpayer records. For example, regular proactive investigations are conducted, the last of which was completed in August 2006, to find any unauthorised access by ATO staff to high profile taxpayers such as celebrities and sports personalities.Where unauthorised access is alleged or detected, the ATO may initiate misconduct proceedings or criminal prosecution.As part of its communication and awareness strategies, the ATO requires that all staff attend fraud and awareness training which contains specific warnings about the consequences of unauthorised access to taxpayer records. These warnings to staff are repeated on screen each time an ATO officer logs on to an ATO computer. Also the matter is regularly discussed in staff publications.From 1 March 1996 to 31 August 2006, the ATO has recorded 197 confirmed cases of ATO officers accessing taxpayer records where they were not authorised to do so.Over the same period, 1813 taxpayers have had their records accessed inappropriately.Refer to 1(c) above.The ATO continually seeks out better practice initiatives to ensure the protection of taxpayer information from unauthorised access. Discussions have taken place with a number of national and international agencies to share information on new technology or practices that may assist.The 27 staff who made unauthorised access to taxpayer records were from the following business lines:Business LineNumber of CasesClient Contact1Goods and Services Tax6Tax Practitioner and Lodgment Support2Serious Non-Compliance1Micro Enterprises and Individuals4Operations11Small to Medium Enterprises2Of the 27 staff identified, 12 resigned during the course of the investigation, 4 had their employment terminated and 11 remain in the same business area having received other forms of sanctions.</DOC>

Mackay Science and Technology PrecinctMinisterial approval for $200,000 (GST exclusive) was granted on 30 November 2005 for the development of a comprehensive business plan.The business plan was provided to the Department on 27 July 2006 and an external viability assessment is due in October 2006.Buchanan Rodeo Park in Mt IsaMinisterial approval was provided on 2 November 2004 for funding of $5 million (GST exclusive).The development application was approved by the Mt Isa City Council on 28 September 2005.Mount Isa City Council has advised that 80% of the rodeo stadium facility contracts have been let. The remaining 20% are yet to be let.Since November 2004, project costs have increased from $10 million to $15.8 million. Mt Isa City Council have sourced an extra $2.8 million partner funding.A request for additional funding of $3 million made by Cr Ron McCullogh, Mt Isa's Mayor, was not approved by the Regional Partnerships Ministerial Committee on 13 September 2006 and the Committee sought completion of work that was possible with available funds.The Department will negotiate the rescoping of the project and a funding agreement variation after the Mt Isa City Council reviews its budget.As at September 2006, the following progress has been made on the project:site works, earth works, stormwater drainage and sewage are completed;foundations for all buildings and cattle yards have been completed;security and cattle yard fencing is completed.Mt Isa City Council has advised that expressions of interest for the construction of the pavilion closed 30 August 2006 and the tender is expected to be let shortly.Mt Isa City Council also advised it is expecting to employ a Facility Manager in October 2006 to oversight the Buchanan Park official opening and ongoing management of the Park.On 11 October 2006 Mt Isa City Council launched a new website which provides a link to the Buchanan Park site. This site has descriptions and photos on the progress of the construction.The project is expected to be completed by 30 April 2007. The three day opening event is expected to take place in June 2007.Dalby Wambo Events Centre Covered ArenaThe Regional Partnerships Ministerial Committee approved this project on 30 March 2006, conditional upon the applicant obtaining all necessary licences and approvals.On 8 June 2006 Dalby Town Council appointed a tenderer to carry out the detailed design of the covered arena, develop the construction tender documents and project manage construction of the covered arena.It is anticipated that construction will commence in February 2007.Bert Hinkler Hall of Aviation, BundabergFunding of $1.5 million (GST exclusive) was provided as a commitment from the 2001 federal election.Ministerial approval was provided on 16 June 2005 for $2.5 million (GST exclusive) as a commitment from the 2004 federal election.In May 2006 the Queensland Government announced funding of $1.5 million and the Bundaberg City Council has revised the project scope accordingly.Preparatory work (soil testing and site surveys) on the site commenced August 2006.The project is expected to be completed by 30 April 2008.The Australian Equine and Livestock Centre, TamworthThe project received Ministerial approval on 3 May 2005 for funding of $6 million (GST exclusive).On 19 March 2006 the NSW State Government provided its partnership contribution of $3.5 million to Tamworth Regional Council.The Department of Transport and Regional Services made the first payment of $2 million on 9 June 2006 on execution of the funding agreement.The development application was approved by Council on 25 July 2006.Construction is expected to commence in early December 2006.Additional funding of $500,000 is being provided by both the Tamworth Pastoral and Agricultural Society and the New England Institute of TAFE.The revised construction period still anticipates a completion date of mid 2007.No.The Government has committed funds for these Election Commitments. The Department of Transport and Regional Services arranges for external viability assessments to be undertaken on major projects to minimise risks associated with the delivery of the projects. Assessments were undertaken for the Dalby Showgrounds project, the Bert Hinkler Hall of Aviation project, the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre project and the Mackay Science and Technology Precinct. An external viability assessment on the Buchanan Rodeo Park project was not undertaken as the applicant is the local council and was considered low risk. The financial projections and work plan for the project were well considered and the release of funding was strictly tied to the delivery of key milestones.</DOC>

The allegations made by the US Government against David Hicks are detailed in the particulars of the charges previously laid against him before the Military Commission on 10 June 2004. Those allegations do not refer specifically to an attack or firing of a weapon by Hicks at a US soldier. The US allegations against David Hicks include allegations that he had extensive weapons and tactical training with Al Qaida and that, armed with an AK-47 automatic rifle, ammunition and grenades, he joined others engaged in combat against Coalition forces in Konduz, Afghanistan.Yes.It would not be appropriate for me to comment.Under previous military commission rules, the accused was able to cross examine each witness presented by the prosecution who appeared before the commission.The Military Commissions Act of 2006 allows the accused to cross examine witnesses who testify against him.This is a matter for the US Government.I have had several discussions with US Attorney-General Gonzales, most recently in Washington on 29 September 2006, during which I emphasised the Australian Government's desire to see Mr Hicks' case dealt with fairly and expeditiously.</DOC>

Users of Commonwealth vehicles have been encouraged to purchase ethanol blended fuels where possible. As a result, sales of ethanol blends to the Commonwealth fleet have seen a 50-fold increase in the period from October 2005 to August 2006.An E5 and E10 vehicle testing program, managed by the Department of Environment and Heritage, is currently underway.The Government has also worked with the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries in preparing information about the compatibility of vehicles with ethanol blends. The FCAI website has a list of all the vehicles that are currently compatible with ethanol. This website can be accessed at http://www.fcai.com.au.Ethanol labelling requirements were simplified in January 2006.The Government is investigating the technical issues associated with standardising diesel/biodiesel blends.The Government has established a working group with State and Territory representatives to discuss how the results of the study into health impacts of ethanol blend fuels could be used to develop a consistent approach to setting fuel volatility standards.Tenders have been sought for a study to evaluate the health impacts of ethanol blend fuels.The Government intends to promote the environmental properties of biodiesel through a trial in Kakadu National Park.</DOC>

The required information is not available to enable a response on behalf of ANTA.DEST's responsibilities do not require the skills of typical trade/industry types of apprentices. DEST's capability requirements are predominantly found in Graduates and there are limited opportunities available for the type of work undertaken at the level of office-based New Apprentices. However, New Apprentices do form one part of the entry level recruitment initiatives (along with Cadets and Graduates) which occur as part of the agency's overall recruitment strategy. The Department conducts a full campaign each year to recruit apprentices, actively encouraging applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people with a disability.The number of New Apprenticeships which were traditional apprenticeships is 89.Final numbers will only be known at the end of 2006.</DOC>

Centrelink, Medicare Australia and the Child Support Agency all have initiatives in place to offer services online.Currently, services offered online are also available through other channels, such as phone, mail or in-person, allowing citizens to choose how they wish to interact with Human Services agencies.There are currently no initiatives underway to stop existing face-to-face or paper-based services and offer them exclusively online. As such, there is no direct and significant impact on current staffing.However, the Department of Human Services and its agencies are working to increase the take-up of online services because they are convenient for many citizens and are an efficient and effective way for government to deliver services.Initiatives to increase the take-up of online services are based on citizen demand. For example, students may be directed to online services as their 'first point of call' in the future because many students prefer to do things online and have ready access to the internet. Other options will continue to be available for those with circumstances that prevent them from accessing services online.As citizens choose to do more interactions with government online, there may be reduced demand on other channels. Over time, staffing and resources may be used in different ways in order to meet citizen demand.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes at an estimated cost of $132.</DOC>

Yes. These calls were referred to Air Force for follow-up with Mr Kerr.Yes. For safety reasons, Mr Kerr was directed to move his vehicle into the base, park and return immediately to the Pass Office for clearance.On 27 February 2006 and at peak entry time (6.45am), three heavy vehicles (semi-trailers) attempted to enter the base. Two parked in the reserved parking spaces, which allow drivers to alight to obtain entry passes. Mr Kerr's vehicle was the third to attempt entry, and he parked it in such a way that the vehicle obstructed traffic in one entry lane.One of the Chubb security guards on duty that morning approached Mr Kerr and asked him to move his truck into the base, just forward of the main access point, and then return immediately to the Pass Office for clearance. Mr Kerr became irate and verbally aggressive towards the guard and asked why the other two trucks were not required to move. The guard pointed out the traffic congestion being caused by Mr Kerr's vehicle, and Mr Kerr then complied with the guard's instructions.Yes.No.Yes. Corporate Services and Infrastructure Group Officers at Amberley have conducted an investigation. No breaches of either security or protocol were detected. Chubb security staff involved adhered to all extant security and safety procedures. Mr Kerr was treated in a polite and courteous manner at all times.</DOC>

Information on the name and location of child care services is available publicly through the Child Care Access Hotline on 1800 670 305. The Government generally funds parent rather than centres.
The Inclusion Support Subsidy (ISS) is provided to assist child care service providers with the cost of including children with additional needs in approved child care services. ISS can contribute to the provision of relief staff while the carer attends training, specialist equipment and resources and employing an additional worker to increase the staff to child ratio. It is important to note that the focus of the Inclusion Support is to build the services' capacity to include a child with ongoing high support needs.
The subsidy rate for the ISS is currently $15.04 per hour and is indexed annually.
Child Care Services are invited to contact their local Inclusion Support Agency, who will assist in identifying strategies for the service to include children with ongoing high support needs and may identify a need to access additional supports, such as ISS.
The board of the Ella Community Centre has told my Department, on 10 October 2006, that it has decided to continue the operation of its outside school hours care service. The Centre aims to increase enrolments and will continue to provide care for children with special needs.
My Office has corresponded with the Ella Community Centre and provided information on funding available through FaCSIA programs to assist the service.

Original timelines for the preparation of Water Quality Improvement Plans (WQIPs) have been extended in response to the technical challenges presented by the planning process and the need to engage a wide range of stakeholders in WQIP preparation.Yes.and (5) There is no dedicated implementation funding under the Coastal Catchments Initiative (CCI). WQIPs developed under the CCI are intended to support existing water quality management arrangements in accredited NRM plans by enhancing target setting, better defining investment priorities and identifying key institutional and policy settings required to achieve the plans' objectives. As such, their delivery will be incorporated into regional NRM investment processes. These investment processes draw on a wide range of government and private sector funds.Yes.

For example, time taken for the customer to return documents to Centrelink, waiting periods, preclusion periods, non-payment periods, availability of Centrelink staff and/or the customer for an interview, casual work resulting in the customer having no entitlement for a payment or several payments.2 Data source: Centrelink's Data Services Team, extracted the data by SAS dated 3 March 2006.It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.3 Data source: Centrelink's Data Services Team, extracted the data by SAS dated 7 April 2006.It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.4 Data source: Centerline's Data Services Team extracted the data by SAS dated 5 May 2006It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.5 Data source: Centrelink's Data Services Team, extracted the data by SAS dated 2 June 2006.It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.6 Data source: Centrelink's Data Services Team, extracted the data by SAS dated 7 July 2006.It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.7 Data source: Centrelink's Data Services Team, extracted the data by SAS dated 4 August 2006.It includes all Newstart customers with a status of current.CDEP customers have been excluded.Customers with Zero Rate have been excluded.8 Data source: Weekly Welfare to Work Reports, produced by Data Services, Centrelink extracted the data by SAS and is current as at the 11 August 2006.

I am not aware of any formal research on Australian diesel passenger car engines.However, I am aware that a number of councils around Australia have conducted trials on their fleet vehicles and buses.Newcastle City Council for example has conducted a trial of biodiesel in their fleet vehicles. This includes utility vehicles, four wheel drives and trucks. I understand that Newcastle City Council will be releasing their report on this project in the next month or so.</DOC>

Taxpayers who account on a cash basis are not required to pay the full amount of GST upon receipt of a part-payment. They are only required to pay GST on the amount actually received.Taxpayers who account on a non-cash basis may have to pay the full amount of GST upon receipt of a part payment. This will occur as a result of the operation of the normal GST rules.However, if the part payment is a security deposit, then no GST is payable until a later time when the deposit becomes part of the payment for a supply, or is forfeited. Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2006/2 explains how and when this GST deferral applies.In the circumstance described above, the business does not have to wait for a refund if the sale does not proceed as it did not have to pay the GST.If a business has paid the GST, because, for example, it does not account on a cash basis and the amount was not eligible to be treated as a security deposit (for example, because the amount of the deposit was too high to be considered a security deposit), it will receive any refund it is entitled to when it lodges its next activity statement.Small businesses are not disadvantaged by GSTR 2006/2 which explains that businesses can delay paying GST on security deposits whether they use the cash or non-cash accounting method.On 5 June 2006 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal handed down its decision in Reliance Carpet Company Pty Ltd v the Commissioner of Taxation. The case concerned a supply of real property. A 10% deposit was paid and later forfeited to the vendor as the sale did not proceed. The Tribunal ruled that a GST obligation arose in respect of the forfeited deposit. The amount that is subject to GST is the amount of the forfeited deposit and not the contract price for the sale of the property.The taxpayer has appealed the Tribunal's decision to the Federal Court and the Government awaits the outcome of the appeal.</DOC>

Preconstruction work is underway, involving design, planning, environmental assessments, land acquisitions and utility adjustments. Given the increase in the cost estimate for the project from $382 million to $765 million in July 2005, New South Wales and Australian Government officials are currently considering how best to progress the project and will report to Governments on this.The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) estimates that all preconstruction activities should be completed by early to mid 2008. This should allow for construction to commence during 2008-09.Until preconstruction activities have been completed, and project delivery issues have been finalised, estimated completion dates are not available.The RTA provided a revised cost estimate of $765 million for the project in July 2005. This is in 2005 dollars.As at the end of August 2006, the Australian Government has provided $37.4 million to the RTA for the project.</DOC>

     Amount payable as at 1 July 2006.2:     A service fee or JSKA credit will only include a highly disadvantaged supplement if the job seeker is classified as highly disadvantaged at the time of commencement into assistance. An IS Outcome fee will only be paid at the higher rate if the job seeker is classified as highly disadvantaged at the time of placement into the job or education. Highly disadvantaged Job seekers attract the rate applicable to those who are unemployed two years or longer.A job seeker is classified as 'highly disadvantaged' on the basis of their Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI) score. The JSCI is a series of questions that elicit information on the job seeker's personal circumstances. The answers to these questions are assigned weights or points depending on the extent to which they contribute to the job seeker's probability of becoming long term unemployed. These points added together constitute the JSCI score. Job seekers whose score is above a predetermined point are classified as highly disadvantaged. The JSCI is administered to job seekers when they first register with Centrelink or directly with a Job Network member. The JSCI is revised or updated by the Job Network member or by Centrelink at any time during the provision of employment services if the job seeker's circumstances change. Updating the JSCI may or may not alter the JSCI score and as a result the highly disadvantaged status of the job seeker may or may not change.The Department has a JSCI Quality Assurance plan in place to assure the accuracy of the JSCI record, including the highly disadvantaged status of the job seeker. This plan comprises a range of assurance activities, including: analysis of the number of updates of JSCI records and the proportion that result in a change in highly disadvantaged status, on the basis of Job Network site and organisation; regular and routine monitoring visits by Departmental staff that incorporate examination of the JSCI record of individual job seekers; and departmental surveys of job seekers to verify the accuracy of the JSCI record.Under the Employment Services Contract 2006-2009, employment service providers are required to maintain accurate records. If any employment service provider has claimed Commonwealth funds as a result of inaccurate job seeker records, then in accordance with the Contract the department is obliged to recover funds gained as a result of these inaccuracies. It is not considered appropriate to comment on the affairs of individual service providers.</DOC>

This was one of the Department's conclusions, however the Department also advised me that the independent Biosis Research Pty Ltd report, Wind farm collision risk for birds  -  Cumulative risk for threatened and migratory species, had concluded that the Orange-bellied Parrot has a high probability of becoming extinct within the next 50 years and while the impacts of wind farms on the species is low, almost any negative impact on the species could top the balance against its continued existence. The Department also advised me that there is Orange-bellied Parrot foraging habitat within 35 kilometres both east and west of the wind farm site. As Minister, it is my responsibility to consider input and advice from a range of sources. In relation to the Bald Hills windfarm project, I took account of all the relevant factors as set out in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act).The Woolnorth and Portland Wind Energy Installations were early approvals under the EPBC Act and both were based on the best information available at the time. The Biosis report was completed in February 2006 and contained new and relevant information that I was required to take into account when considering the Bald Hills Wind Energy Installation proposal.The Musselroe Wind Energy Installation was approved in 2005 and is not located within the known distributional range of the Orange-bellied Parrot.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows.The preparation of an answer to these questions would involve a significant diversion of resources, and in the circumstances, I do not consider that the additional work can be justified. The practice of successive governments has been not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in assembling such information on a general basis.</DOC>

The Department has not commissioned advice on or provided me with its assessment of the economic cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Department has provided me with briefing for my information, on reports that sought to estimate the economic cost of reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The reports by the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change  -  The Business Case for Early Action; and ABARE  -  The Economic Impact of Climate Change Policy: the Role of Technology and Economic Instruments are in the public domain. The Department's briefing noted the findings of these reports and that their estimates of costs vary according to the assumptions and scenarios used in their respective economic analysis.One scenario modelled by ABARE closely mirrors that proposed by the Australian Labor Party. It concluded that:Petrol prices would doubleGDP growth would be 11% lowerReal wages would be 21% lowerOil and gas production would fall by 60%Coal production would be down 32%Electricity output would fall by 23%Agriculture would decline by 44%No.No.The Department prepares annual projections that estimate Australia's greenhouse emissions out to 2020. The 2005 projections (the most recent available) estimate that Australia's greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors will be 122 per cent of 1990 by 2020. This includes projected emissions savings of 114 Mt CO2-e from Australian Government and other programmes. In the absence of these measures, Australia's projected emissions are estimated to be 143 per cent of 1990 by 2020.The projected growth in Australia's emissions reflects a number of factors including strong economic growth, the fact that Australia unlike many developed countries has a growing population, the energy intensive export driven nature of our economy and the large distances that it is necessary to transport goods.The Government recognises that climate change is likely to have an adverse impact on a number of vulnerable, threatened and endangered species and ecological communities. However, it is not possible to accurately estimate what proportion will be adversely affected.No such projections are available.</DOC>

The Government is committed to ensuring that the regulatory framework applying to superannuation is robust and has the confidence of the Australian community. As part of this commitment, the Government has in place safeguards to assist people who lose their superannuation savings through fraudulent conduct or theft. Part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) allows the trustee of a superannuation fund to apply to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, as the Minister responsible for superannuation, for a grant of financial assistance where the fund has suffered loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft.Under Part 23, the Minister has discretion to grant financial assistance of up to 100 per cent of a loss suffered due to fraudulent conduct or theft, subject to being satisfied that the loss has caused a substantial reduction of the fund's assets and it is in the public interest for a grant to be made.In relation to the superannuation funds of former employees of the now-defunct Ansett Australia Airlines, I can advise the honourable member that there were five stand-alone Ansett superannuation plans in operation when Ansett Australia Airlines collapsed in 2001. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has advised that the collapse of Ansett Australia Airlines did not necessitate any asset recovery actions in relation to any of the Ansett Plans because the collapse did not result in assets in the Ansett Plans, or the assets of the trustees of the plans, being lost. I am also advised that all outstanding employer contributions concerning the Ansett Plans have been paid.Since the collapse of Ansett Australia Airlines, all of the five Ansett Plans have been wound-up. A new fund called the Ansett Residual Superannuation Fund was established on 1 July 2004 to represent the residual assets and liabilities of two of the wound-up Ansett Plans  -  the Ansett Australia Ground Staff Superannuation Plan and the Flight Attendants' Benefits Scheme. APRA continues to supervise the administration of this fund, which is intended to be wound up once all outstanding insurance claims have been settled and surplus assets have been distributed amongst the members.</DOC>

Not applicable.and (5) No. The taxation consequences of a reimbursement of school holiday childcare is that the reimbursement does not constitute assessable income of the employee, under s 26(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as the payment is a fringe benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Accordingly, the payment is subject to Fringe Benefits Tax as an expense payment fringe benefit. This treatment is consistent with the ATOs view in Tax Ruling 92/15.The Department's Certified Agreement makes provisions for the reimbursement of some or all of the costs incurred by the employee where the Department requires that employee to be away from home outside of normal working hours.Reimbursement can be made for any care paid by the employee.</DOC>

The current average cost of a stand-alone electronic queue system is approximately $30,000 per office. This includes all hardware and software for each system plus installation. There are no maintenance costs for the first 12 months. The running costs of the electronic queue systems are absorbed into each Medicare office's overall running costs.Each queue system is a stand-alone system and is monitored for data accuracy and responsiveness in providing management reports.Electronic queue systems will not be installed in all Medicare Offices across Australia. Queue systems will be installed in Medicare Offices where there is a demonstrated business need.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 3 hours at an estimated cost of $189.</DOC>

Information relating to enforcement summonses that are issued in connection to Child Support Agency (CSA) matters are stored on the customer's hard copy file. There are approximately 4,800 hard copy litigation files, stored in various sites throughout Australia. This information is not readily accessible.Based on the information that is available, the CSA estimates that approximately 2800 enforcement summonses have been issued by the CSA since 1996.An enforcement summons is issued by a Magistrate in order to have the child support debtor advise the court about assets, property interests and income so that appropriate orders may be made by the court to ensure payment of the child support debt. An enforcement summons is issued by the relevant court and summonses the respondent child support debtor to the court on the date notified. If the debtor fails to appear in court on the day specified then the magistrate may decide to issue an arrest warrant.The Child Support Agency would only support the issuing of an arrest warrant as a last resort where all other attempts at negotiation and enforcement for the payment of the child support debt have been unsuccessful and the debtor fails to appear in court on more than one occasion.As explained above information relating to arrest warrants is stored in the customer's hard copy file and not readily accessible. Based on the information available, the CSA is aware of approximately 50 instances where arrest warrants have been issued in relation to child support matters since 1996. The records available indicate that only three arrest warrants have been executed since 1996.In each of these cases, negotiation for the payment of child support had broken down and the child support debtor repeatedly failed to appear before the court to discuss their refusal to pay child support.The CSA is aware of one instance where the reason for issuing an arrest warrant was subsequently determined to be incorrect. In this case the child support debtor failed to appear in court because he was already in custody on an unrelated matter.As explained above, information relating to arrest warrants is stored in the customer's hardcopy file and not readily accessible. The CSA is unable to provide a specific figure in relation to this question.The CSA does not collect or hold information relating to the carrying out of arrest warrants. The Australian Federal Police or the relevant State Police are responsible for carrying out arrest warrants in relation to these matters.</DOC>

Defence is conducting two reviews to guide decisions regarding the future use of RAAF Williams Point Cook. The first is an accommodation review of Melbourne that will address the future Defence accommodation requirements in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. The second is a strategic review of options for the future use of RAAF Williams Point Cook. Both reviews are expected to be completed by the end of 2006. The Government remains committed to retaining RAAF Williams Point Cook in Defence ownership and use.The Deputy Chief of Air Force held a meeting with stakeholders and interest groups on 30 October 2006 at RAAF Williams Point Cook to provide an update on the Air Force Point Cook Development Review. In addition, the RAAF Heritage Advisory Council has met three times and has developed a discussion paper that is under consideration by the Chief of Air Force. The Council was formed to provide advice on the strategy and policy that will preserve RAAF heritage and the RAAF Museum.Once Defence reviews of the future use of RAAF Williams Point Cook are completed, it is anticipated that further consultation with stakeholders and interest groups will occur between January and June 2007.No.A Heritage Management Plan for RAAF Williams Point Cook has been completed and this will be used to guide detailed heritage assessments to be carried out before any action is taken to modify, refurbish or demolish any buildings. The plan details how to best conserve, manage and promote the heritage value of RAAF Williams Point Cook for current and future generations.It remains the Government's intention to maintain the heritage of RAAF Williams Point Cook and ensure its future as an operating airfield.</DOC>

The definition of a Deseal/Reseal participant has been agreed to by the Government and there is no intention of amending it. No consideration is being given to the creation of an additional scheme for ex-gratia payment to include workers who undertook activities outside the formal Deseal/Reseal programs.These workers currently have coverage for workers compensation. Compensation claims are determined not only on the basis of the claimed link to Deseal/Reseal work, but also based on the person's general service work history. For instance, if a person claims that the Deseal/Reseal environment caused their condition then their claim can be considered in two ways:the first is under the specific Deseal/Reseal provisions under subsection 7(2) of the Safety, Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA); andthe second is based on their general work history under the SRCA and/or Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA).From September 2001, when the Deseal/Reseal Compensation Team was established, any claims which could be accepted based on a link between the claimant's general service and their claimed condition under either the SRCA and/or the VEA have already been accepted.(2)   and (3) Generally, personnel from Squadrons 482, 1 and 6 do not satisfy the definition of a F-111 Deseal/Reseal participant. Therefore, they will not be entitled to an ex-gratia lump sum payment (as distinct from compensation). However, some personnel from these squadrons who were assigned to the core Deseal/Reseal programs have applied meet the eligibility criteria and have received the ex-gratia lump sum payment.All military personnel are entitled to claim compensation benefits under the VEA, and the SRCA. Eligibility for these benefits is independent of the F-111 Deseal/Reseal Lump Sum scheme. These benefits are associated with a specific injury or illness arising from employment. Claims for compensation are processed as they are received and are determined on their merits and must show a causal connection between a diagnosed injury or illness and employment.(4)   If illness or diseases develop, claims for compensation can be lodged at any time in the future under either the SRCA or the VEA or both, as an individual's service allows.(5)   (a)   No;(b)   No; and(c)   No.(b)   No. There is no confidentiality clause.(6)   (a)   No; and(b)   No. There is no confidentiality clause.(7)   Because members of these Squadrons do not fall within the definition of people eligible for ex-gratia payments and therefore could not receive payments.(8)   This is a factually incorrect statement and there is no basis for the false and misleading premise of the question. No provision was made for the defence of specific categories of claims.(9)   149 persons have been identified as 482, 1 or 6 Squadron members who have submitted compensation claims under the SRCA. 82 have already been processed and had some conditions determined or the claim completely finalised. The balance of these claims have had no determinations made on their conditions at this stage.Future claims will be processed in the usual manner as they are received.</DOC>

I am aware that there have been concerns about the indexation of the T&amp;PI pension, particularly that from March 1998 it should have been indexed with reference to Male Total average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE).Over recent years the Government has carefully considered both the adequacy of the T&amp;PI pension and its means of indexation to ensure that it is fulfilling its intended purpose and supports those veterans most in need.While the Australian Government's support available to T&amp;PI veterans and their partners has more or less maintained relativity with average wages for the past 20 years, in response to the Clarke Report the Government changed its means of indexation.The T&amp;PI pension is indexed twice yearly and is made up of two components  -  the General Rate and the Above General Rate disability pension. Since 20 March 2004, the Above General Rate component has been indexed with reference to both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and (MTAWE), in the same way as the maximum basic rate of service pension. This ensures that the Above General Rate component, which is only received by our most severely impaired veterans, is aligned with both CPI and MTAWE.The General Rate component of the T&amp;PI pension, paid as compensation for pain and suffering, continues to be indexed in line with increases in the CPI to ensure that its value is not eroded by inflation. This indexation method is consistent with the indexation arrangements for most workers compensation payments.Another measure introduced as part of the Government's response to the Clarke Report is the introduction of the Defence Force Income Support Allowance (DFISA). The new allowance, introduced in September 2004, effectively exempts my Department's disability pension from the income test at Centrelink.Following the introduction of DFISA, all T&amp;PI veterans and their partners are now treated equitably, regardless of whether they receive their income support payments from my Department or Centrelink. This means that veterans and their partners in similar circumstances receive the same amount of Government assistance irrespective of whether they receive their income support under social security law or Veterans' Affairs legislation.The Government continues to monitor the situation and examine views raised by the ex - service community to ensure that the current level of T&amp;PI pension and its indexation arrangements are satisfactory.</DOC>

There has been no funding provided during the last financial year. TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc may be eligible for funding under the following DVA grants programs:Saluting Their Service commemorations grants;Building Excellence in Support and Training (BEST); andVeteran &amp; Community (V&amp;C) Grants.The Saluting Their Service commemorations program provides grants for projects that are directly commemorative of Australia's servicemen and women involved in war, conflict and peacekeeping operations. It is designed to leave a lasting legacy of ongoing commemoration and understanding by the Australian community.BEST provides support and resources to ex-service organisation practitioners for pensions and welfare work to assist veterans, past and present members of the Australian Defence Forces and their dependants. A major objective of the program is to ensure high quality claims and appeals assistance by ex-service organisation practitioners that in turn will assist the Department of Veterans' Affairs with timely and appropriate processing.V&amp;C Grants aim to maintain and improve the independence and quality of life of members of the veteran community by providing funding for projects that support activities and services that sustain and/or enhance their health and well-being.While individuals may apply for STS grants funding, they are not eligible to apply for BEST or V&amp;C Grants funding. Organisations such as the TPI Disabled Soldiers Association of Victoria Inc are eligible to apply for grants funding under all three programs. Grants funding provided to an organisation is not for distribution to individual members of that organisation, the conditions for expenditure of grant funding is contained in a grant agreement.The services provided through BEST funding are available to non-members of the Association and non-TPI pension recipients.Services that may be available through a project funded by a Veteran &amp; Community Grant are generally to benefit the entire veteran community and can also benefit the wider community.</DOC>

The Australian Government's view is that any trial of Mr Hicks should happen as quickly as possible. I have re-iterated this in conversations with US Attorney-General Gonzales.There is no set date for Mr Hicks' trial at this stage. Mr Hicks has not yet been formally charged under the new Act. A US Defense department spokesperson is reported as saying said that trials are not expected until 2007.The length of detention of an accused in custody prior to trial differs in individual cases. The Government has always maintained that Mr Hicks' case should be resolved as quickly as possible and that Mr Hicks should face trial to answer the allegations against him. I reiterated my concerns in relation to the length of time this has taken in discussions with Attorney-General Gonzales in September 2006. However, it is the right of respective parties to test decisions in the courts and this is what has been happening in the US over the last couple of years.See above answer to Question (2). The United States Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on 29 September 2006; the Act was signed into law by President Bush on 17 October 2006. The Act provides an alternative method for trying detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. The Act authorises the President to establish military commissions, establishes the jurisdiction of the commissions over 'unlawful enemy combatants', and sets out procedures for the treatment, prosecution and conviction of suspected terrorists. Additionally, regulations detailing military commission procedures are to be formulated within 90 days of the enactment of the Act.The Act incorporates a number of fundamental due process safeguards for defendants, including a right to be present throughout the trial with limited exceptions, a right to see all the evidence against an accused, a right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, a presumption of innocence and an extensive appeals process up to the Supreme Court. Whether or not the Act complies with the Geneva Convention and other legal principles will ultimately be a matter for the United States government and the courts.I have held several discussions with US Attorney-General Gonzales, in which I have emphasised the Australian Government's desire to see Mr Hicks' case dealt with expeditiously. I also reiterated the Government's expectation that additional safeguards negotiated previously to apply to Mr Hicks' case will apply to any new military commission trial of Mr Hicks. A number of issues which were the focus of those safeguards have been taken up in the new legislation. The additional safeguards previously negotiated included:Based upon the specific facts of his case, the United States has assured Australia that it will not seek the death penalty in Mr Hicks' case.Australia and the United States agreed to work towards putting arrangements in place to transfer Mr Hicks to Australia, if convicted, to serve any penal sentence in Australia in accordance with Australian and United States laws.Conversations between Mr Hicks and his lawyers will not be monitored by the United States.Subject to any necessary security restrictions, Mr Hicks' trial will be open, the media will be present and Australian officials may observe the proceedings.The Australian Government may make submissions to any review panel which would review Mr Hicks' military commission trial.Should Mr Hicks choose to retain an Australian lawyer with appropriate security clearances as a consultant to his legal team, that person may have direct face-to-face communications with their client.Mr Hicks may talk to his family via telephone and two family members are permitted to attend his trial.Attorney-General Gonzales has given an undertaking that the assurances previously negotiated will be honoured. With respect to rules of evidence and rights of appeal, see (5) above.(7)   At the Australian Government's request, there have been two investigations into allegations of mistreatment of Mr Hicks, neither of which revealed any evidence of abuse. A United States Department of Defense investigation concluded in August 2004 that there was no evidence to support the allegations. The most recent report by the United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was provided to the Australian Government in July 2005. NCIS found no information that substantiated or corroborated the allegations of abuse.Mr Hicks is not held in solitary confinement. Conditions for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are equivalent to a maximum security facility in the US and his conditions are similar to those who are in custody awaiting trial for terrorism offences in Australia. Earlier this year, Mr Hicks, together with a number of other detainees, was transferred to a newly completed facility in Guantanamo Bay. Mr Hicks is being held in the general block area of this facility in a single occupancy cell. Cells in the general block area have windows providing natural light. Mr Hicks continues to have access to an exercise facility in a group area. He is able to communicate with the other detainees during exercise periods and between cells.(8)   Australian officials have visited Mr Hicks at Guantanamo Bay on 17 occasions. On each occasion, Mr Hicks' welfare has been assessed. No evidence of abuse or maltreatment has been found by Australian officials. The last consular visit was made to Mr Hicks on 27 September 2006. The Consul-General advised that Mr Hicks looked well but that Mr Hicks chose not to speak to the Consul. We are aware that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) met with Mr Hicks recently at Guantanamo Bay. We have not been advised of the content of the discussions between Mr Hicks and the ICRC. The ICRC would normally take up prisoner concerns with the camp authorities. The Australian Government will continue to monitor Mr Hicks' welfare closely, and fulfil our consular responsibilities to Mr Hicks as an Australian citizen. With regard to the conditions in which Mr Hicks is being held, see (7) above.</DOC>

Consistent with longstanding practice, the Government will not disclose legal advice it has received on the legality of the detention of Mr Hicks.At the request of the Australian Government, there have been two investigations into allegations of physical abuse. A US Department of Defense investigation concluded in August 2004 that there was no evidence to support allegations made by Mr Hicks. The most recent report by the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was provided to the government on 15 July 2005. The NCIS report was extensive and addressed all allegations of physical abuse that had been raised by Mr Hicks. The NCIS concluded there was no evidence to substantiate abuse allegations. Australian officials have met with Mr Hicks on 17 occasions at Guantanamo Bay and have seen no evidence of abuse.Refer to (2) above.Reports that Mr Hicks is being held in solitary confinement are incorrect. Mr Hicks is currently being held in a single occupancy cell in the general block area of a newly completed facility in Guantanamo Bay. Cells in the general block area have windows providing natural light. Mr Hicks continues to have access to exercise in group areas and he is able to communicate with other detainees during exercise periods and between cells.Refer to (4) above.The Prime Minister stated that 'the information we have been given_is that [David Hicks] has, amongst those that are held at Guantanamo Bay, committed more serious offences than most'. Under the previous military commission system, Mr Hicks was charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes, attempted murder by an unprivileged belligerent, and aiding the enemy. These charges relate to Mr Hicks' alleged involvement with al-Qa'ida and activities in Afghanistan. Mr Hicks has not yet been formally charged under the new Military Commissions Act signed into law by President Bush on 17 October 2006.Consistent with longstanding practice, the Government will not disclose legal advice it has received on the legality of the American military tribunal process under international law.The statement in relation to a 'new trial' related to the Government's expectation that, subsequent to the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v Rumsfeld, the United States Administration would work towards putting in place a new system of trying detainees which complies with the court's decision. (b) There is no set date for Mr Hicks' trial at this stage. A US Defense department spokesperson is reported as saying that trials are not expected until 2007. The Australian Government's view is that any trial of Mr Hicks should happen as quickly as possible. I have re-iterated this in conversations with US Attorney-General Gonzales.</DOC>

The Department has received requests from the Australian medical community to produce state-wide, or nation-wide, maps of designated districts of workforce shortage. For the reasons stated in (2) these maps are not currently available. Overseas trained doctors and practices are able to enquire on the Department's website (searchable database) as to whether a locality is a district of workforce shortage. Search criteria include state/territory and town, suburb or business centre.Although a 'visual' indication of designated districts of workforce shortage, such as maps, could be helpful in determining options for settlement, as well as to the broader Australian medical community, the statistics that underlie the determination of districts of workforce shortage are updated quarterly, which would necessitate regularly updating such maps. This would reduce their usefulness and currency.The only overseas trained general practitioners, granted section 19AB exemptions to work in inner metropolitan areas, are those who have successfully demonstrated that exceptional individual circumstances exist, or those working in after hours clinics. Almost all inner metropolitan section 19AB exemptions relate to overseas trained doctors who are specialists. The current number of these specialists across Australia is 877.The current system for determining whether a surgery falls within a district of workforce shortage is effective as it is based on doctor and population statistics that are objective and quantifiable. These are derived from robust data collections and are applied on a nationally consistent basis. The validity of statistics utilised to determine districts of workforce shortage is further enhanced through their updating, on a quarterly basis, ensuring that any fluctuations in population access to doctors is detected. This increases the scope for surgeries to accurately assess whether they are eligible to employ overseas trained doctors in the first instance. In terms of outcomes, the section 19AB exemption measure has been effective, as demonstrated by the fact that over the period 1995-96 to 2004-05, rural general practitioners have increased by over 20 per cent in full-time workload equivalent terms, compared with an increase for urban general practitioners of 2.8 per cent over the same period.and (6) (a) and (b). Over the financial year 2005-06, 9 inner metropolitan general practices in South Australia closed (note: figure based on Practice Incentive Payment (PIP) accredited practices which comprise the majority of practices). None of these practices applied for a section 19AB exemption.This is correct insofar that section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act), introduced on 1 January 1997 enables the Government to restrict employment of overseas trained doctors to private practice in rural, remote and outer metropolitan districts of workforce shortage. As noted above, if exceptional circumstances exist, discretion may be exercised to allow overseas trained general practitioners to work in inner metropolitan areas.The assertion that 'informal policy' considerations are part of the deliberations for section 19AB exemptions is incorrect. The legislation and the guidelines do however, provide scope for a discretionary element in the determination of these matters. The primary consideration on which section 19AB exemption decisions are based is that applicants must work in a district of workforce shortage. The section 19AB guidelines do however, allow additional factors to be considered in reaching a section 19AB decision.</DOC>

and (b) The Commonwealth Government supports a range of initiatives that aim to promote the social and emotional wellbeing of young people, prevent the development of mental health problems, including eating disorders, and to intervene early at the first sign of problems.Commonwealth Government initiatives include:The MindMatters mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention initiative for secondary schools. ($3.2 million p.a.).The KidsMatter mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention initiative for primary schools. ($1.5 million p.a.).The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Mental Health New Early Intervention Services for Parents, Children and Young People initiative. ($28.1 million over five years)The 2005-2006 promoting Better Mental Health Youth Mental Health Initiative ($69 million to June 2009)Additionally, the Commonwealth Government provided funding of $268,000 to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) to develop national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for a range of conditions, including anorexia nervosa.
 
Building a Healthy Active AustraliaHealthy Weight WebsiteLifestyle ScriptsThe Australian Better Health InitiativeIn February 2006, COAG provided $39.8 million over five years through the Australian Better Health Initiative for:a program of rolling national social marketing campaigns to increase the awareness of risk factors related to nutrition, physical activity and healthy weight ($19.8 million);school and community grants to support local responses to combat overweight and obesity, with an emphasis on promoting healthy eating and good nutrition ($12 million);the Healthy Active Ambassador Program, where well-known people will promote healthy living messages to Australians, particularly young people ($2 million);the development of a national food classification system for school canteen guidelines and a national training resource for canteen managers ($2 million);Walk to Work and Walk to School national awareness, including media and public relations activities ($3.2 million); andevaluation and dissemination of best practice programs, including a national network to share best practice information on local programs which support healthy living and active lifestyle ($800,000).The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the government's main health and medical research funding body, provides research support through a variety of mechanisms, including support for individual research projects, broad programs of research and people support schemes.During the period 2000 to 2006, the Commonwealth Government, through the NHMRC, awarded $2.25 million for research investigating eating disorders.and (b) Individuals and organisations are invited to sign the charter. A number of individuals and organisations from Australian have signed the charter. Governments do not appear to be signatories to the charter.The Department of Health and Ageing worked with the RANZCP to develop a series of CPGs for the management of mental disorders, including anorexia nervosa. The CPGs are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. Their main purpose is to improve health outcomes for patients by improving the practice of clinicians. The guidelines are available from the RANZCP website (www.ranzcp.org).Treatment options for people with eating disorders include services from private psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs), clinical psychologists and other allied mental health professionals. State and territory governments also provide complementary services for people with eating disorders through hospitals and state/territory mental health services.a medical practitioner managing the patient under a GP Mental Health Care Plan or under a psychiatrist assessment and management plan; ora psychiatrist or paediatrician.Allied mental health services under this initiative include psychological assessment and therapy services provided by eligible clinical psychologists, and focussed psychological strategies provided by eligible psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.
 
and (b) Clinical advice suggests that patients in early stages of an eating disorder would meet the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder and be eligible for treatment services outlined in the response to (5) above.The Commonwealth Government provides approximately $16,000 per year per medical student to universities to educate our future doctors. This is around $80,000 per student for a five - year course. In addition, governments contribute considerable sums by way of capital contributions to establish medical schools and to operate our postgraduate and vocational training system.The Commonwealth Government supported the development of the CPGs for the RANZCP. The CPGs provide medical professionals with evidence-based information on anorexia nervosa.The Commonwealth Government provides funding to RANZCP to assist in the structural reform of training. This is part of the 'Increasing and Supporting the Mental Health Workforce' measure under the COAG Mental Health package. It is expected that the CPGs will be reviewed as part of this process.The Commonwealth Government has provided approximately $9.5 million in funding for the Support Scheme for Rural Specialist (SSRS) Program since 2002-03. In 2003, a workshop on eating disorders was provided to rural paediatricians. In 2004, a session on obesity was provided to paediatricians and advanced trainees.The Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative includes funding for mental health education and training for appropriate assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders by primary and specialist mental health care providers.CPGs developed by RANZCP for the management of anorexia nervosa outline the most appropriate, evidence based treatment for this disorder.The Department of Health and Ageing worked with the RANZCP to develop a series of CPGs for the management of mental disorders, including anorexia nervosa. The CPGs are systematically developed statements to assist practitioners in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. Their main purpose is to improve health outcomes for patients by improving the practice of clinicians. The guidelines are available from the RANZCP website (www.ranzcp.org).Yes. The incidence of eating disorders does appear to be increasing, however, it is uncertain if this is due to an increase in the number of people developing the disorders or because improved recognition has led to more cases being diagnosed. The term, 'eating disorders', is also being more widely used to not only describe conditions like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa but other behaviours such as compulsive eating, obesity and dieting behaviours. Therefore, it is difficult to gain an accurate picture of the number of people who have eating disorders.and (b) Refer to responses to questions (1)  -  (3), (5) and (7).Refer to responses to questions (1)  -  (2).No, the Commonwealth Government is not considering the development of a national code of conduct on body image, however the Commowealth Government's Mindframe National Media Initiative, addresses the portrayal of mental illness in the media more broadly.The Mindframe resource provides practical advice and information to support the work of media professionals. The resource is designed to inform responsible and appropriate reporting of suicide and mental illness in order to reduce harm and copycat behaviour, and reduce the stigma experienced by people who experience a mental illness.The Mindframe website provides facts on eating disorders, and the broad concepts of Mindframe on reporting and portraying suicide and mental illness sensibly, accurately and responsibly, and avoiding stigmatising stereotypes, should be used by media as a guide when dealing with these issues. The Mindframe website is www.mindframe-media.info.Another of the Mindframe projects run by SANE Australian, StigmaWatch, was established to enhance the community's ability to take action against media reporting that stigmatises mental illness. You can find the SANE StigmaWatch program at www.sane.org.</DOC>

Fuel consumption figures on the label represent results from controlled tests conducted by manufacturers to demonstrate a vehicle model's compliance with the Australian Design Rules (ADRs). All vehicles are tested using standardised, carefully controlled conditions in specialised vehicle emission laboratories which are audited by the Australian Government. No laboratory test can simulate all possible combinations of conditions experienced on the road. The objective in providing the data is to enable consumers to compare vehicles on a common basis, not to predict actual fuel consumption. 'Real world' fuel consumption may vary from the results provided on the fuel consumption label.Although the terms are commonly used, the fuel consumption test does not contain a city and highway component. The test is split into an 'urban' cycle (which represents conditions found in stop-start traffic) and an 'extra-urban' cycle (which involves the vehicle accelerating to higher speeds, but not remaining at a constant speed typical of highway driving). The weighting of the urban and extra urban figures is determined by the test procedures within United National Economic Commission for Europe Regulations incorporated within ADR 81/01, not by the manufacturers.See answer (2), also, although not currently required by ADR 81/01, it is likely that most manufacturers record separate urban and extra-urban figures during testing for fuel consumption.No.I understand that this is not correct. The EC Directive 1994/94/EC regarding consumer information on fuel consumption, including vehicle labelling, only requires the combined fuel consumption and carbon dioxide figures to be displayed. This Directive took effect from 2001 with some states only putting it into law in late 2004. Labels in some member states of the European Union do provide the urban and extra-urban figures, but this is voluntary. At this stage, there are no plans to require car manufacturers to make urban and extra urban data publicly available in Australia. ADR 81/01 is being reviewed, commencing later this year, and this issue will be considered in the review.</DOC>

In addition to the usual clauses of an Australian Government contract, payments to Visy were conditional on the company achieving specific performance milestones. These milestones related to progress by Visy in building, commissioning and operating the pulp and paper mill and set requirements for investment by the company in the project, production tonnage levels and employment levels. The company was required also to report progress on a regular basis.Officers of my Department monitored the progress of this project as part of normal contract management to ensure that it met the conditions. Additionally, regular discussions were held with Visy's operational staff and Departmental officers visited the project site.</DOC>

Environmental organisations that meet the requirements of a charity can be endorsed to receive taxation concessions. Environmental organisations that operate a public fund listed on the Register of Environmental Organisations are entitled to deductible gift status for the public fund. Some organisations are entitled to both tax concession status and deductible gift status for a fund that it operates.The Commissioner of Taxation advised that the following numbers of environmental non-government organisations receive taxation concessions and/or deductibility status:
269 organisations have taxation concession status but not deductibility status.250 organisations have deductibility status but not taxation concession status.110 organisations have both taxation concession status and deductibility status.It has long been the practice of the Commissioner not to provide information relating to specific taxpayers or organisations. However, where the name or ABN of an organisation is known, the Australian business register (ABR) may be searched in order to see which concessions that organisation is endorsed for, and the dates the concessions apply from. The ABR website is www.abr.gov.au.The public funds listed on the Register of Environmental Organisations are available on the Department of Heritage and Environment website, at www.deh.gov.au.(2)   A total of twelve non-government environmental organisations which applied for endorsement for Tax Concession Charity status were refused endorsement in the past three financial years.(3)   The ministerial statement, Investing for a Sustainable Australia, (Budget 2003-04) estimated the cost resulting from the tax deductibility of registered environmental organisations as $14 million for the 2003-04 financial year.The Environment Budget Overview (Budget 2005-06) estimated the cost resulting from the tax deductibility of registered environmental organisations as $22 million for both the 2004-05 and 2005-06 financial years.(4)   From the 2005 financial year until 31 October 2006, 315 internal reviews and 14 client risk reviews of environmental organisations were carried out to ensure that endorsed environmental organisations remain eligible for charitable status(5)   It has long been the practice of the Commissioner not to provide information relating to specific taxpayers or organisations.</DOC>

The responsibility for regulation in relation to the fitting of tachographs to buses, coaches and trucks lies with the states and territories. There is no Australian Government regulation in this area.I also understand that New South Wales is currently the only state in Australia that regulates for mandatory fitting and use of tachographs. Broadly, NSW registered vehicles that must have tachographs include:All coaches used in the course of trade or business, or for hire or reward, but excluding coaches used exclusively as route service buses on routes of less than 40km, and coaches used only as school buses;Also, prime movers and articulated vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Mass or Gross Combination Mass of more than 13.9 tonnes and manufactured on or after 1 January 1991, except for vehicles being used within a radius of 80km from their registered depot unless carrying dangerous goods; andAll trucks with a Gross Vehicle Mass or Gross Combination Mass of more than 13.9 tonnes carrying dangerous goods.</DOC>

Within my Portfolio some preliminary research by Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) has explored the regional impacts of climate variability on crop farm incomes. This research identified the need to develop more flexible farming systems and better predictive tools to lower the risk of climate change to farmers and encourage greater self management of normal climate variability. These reports are available on the ABARE website at www.abare.gov.au.</DOC>

to (9) As was made clear in evidence to the Senate inquiry into The Duties of Australian Personnel in Iraq, Dr Gee wrote to a senior officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding his wish not to continue working in the Iraq Survey Group in 2004. This letter was not provided to Defence. He did, however, discuss his concerns with Defence and other agencies. For further information, please see the Proof Committee Hansard, Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Estimates (Supplementary Budget Estimates), Wednesday 1 November 2006, http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/commttee/S9780.pdf.</DOC>

As is on the public record, I issued no instructions to suppress Dr Gee's letter to my department dated 2 March 2004. As is on the public record also, I asked to see Dr Gee in March 2004 as I was aware that he had some concerns about the methodology of the Iraq Survey Group. I subsequently met with Mr Duelfer, then head of the Iraq Survey Group. I discussed Dr Gee's concerns directly with Mr Duelfer.My department advises me that it retains copies of Dr Gee's letter on its files. The author marked the letter and its attachment with the classifications RESTRICTED and IN-CONFIDENCE. The documents were treated accordingly. I read Dr Gee's letter as did relevant officers in my Department. I understand that other relevant agencies were aware of the contents of the letter and the issues it raised.</DOC>

Since the assets test's introduction in 1985 a person's principal home has been exempt from the assets test, as has up to two hectares of the land immediately adjacent to the home, if used for private purposes. Under the Social Security Act 1991 there is no upper limit placed on the value of the exemption under these provisions. The assessment criteria applies equally to city, regional and rural areas.As part of the 2006-07 Budget the Australian Government announced that from 1 January 2007, Age Pensioners and Carer Payment recipients of age pension age may have the maximum amount of private land that can be exempt from the assets test increased from two hectares to encompass all land on the same title as the Age Pensioner's or carer's home. To benefit from this measure, carers and age pensioners must have a long - term (20 year) attachment to the land, the land must be primarily used for domestic purposes, and they must show that it is not reasonable for them to take alternative action that will enable them to use the land to support themselves.</DOC>

I can guarantee that no employee will lose their place in a business service as a result of reform to disability services.The Business Services Wage Assessment Tool has been independently assessed as an appropriate and accurate means of measuring competency and productivity.I am not aware of any discomfort with the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool from trained and qualified CRS Australia wage assessors who have undertaken approximately 9,000 Business Service Wage Assessment Tool assessments.Whether a person's wage is lowered because of reduced productivity will depend on the industrial arrangements that apply to individual business services.The impact of wage assessments on employees and their families has been generally positive and I am pleased to report that, on average, wages have increased.The Australian Government is committed to building the viability of business services and in turn, providing employment opportunities for people with a disability, enabling them to enjoy the same basic rights and opportunities available to all working Australians.</DOC>

The answer is detailed in Attachment A.It should be noted that the latest Commonwealth expenditure estimates for the agencies listed in the Question on Notice consist of industry levies and Commonwealth matching of those levies under legislation. The value of the levy revenue is subject to a range of variables, depending on the type of levy, such as production, market prices, seasonal conditions and economic factors. In addition, the value of the levy collections also impacts on the value of the Commonwealth matching. The estimates in the early years are regularly adjusted and accordingly are relatively accurate. The forward estimates are based on industry knowledge at the time which can be, variable.Attachment AEXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES, PROGRAMMES OR APPROPRIATIONS FOR PERIOD 2007-08 TO 2009-10Agency, programme or appropriation2007-08 ($'000)2008-09 ($'000)2009-10 ($'000)(a)Cotton Research and Development Corporation13,49612,74711,820(b)Sugar Research and Development Corporation11,65610,95210,744(c)Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation8,5528,5848,617(d)Grains Research and Development Corporation130,600130,600116,000(e)Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority23,77924,62025,489(f)Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1997, s 63(2)  -  payments to industry marketing body64,14664,02464,024(g)Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1997 s 64(2)  -  payments to industry research body20,88020,86620,866(h)Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1997 s 64A(2)  -  payments to the livestock export marketing body2,4342,5562,556(i)Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1997 s 64B(2)  -  payments to the livestock export research body270284284(j)Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act 1997 s 66(1)  -  Commonwealth contribution to industry research body40,50040,50040,500(k)Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, s 326,2116,6096,609(l)Dairy Produce Act 1986, s 6(1)48,42848,69349,232(m)Egg Industry Service Provision Act 2002, s 8(1)4,9004,9004,900(n)Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1980, s 30(3)  -  Grains R&amp;D Corporation  -  Other Grains42,69642,69642,696(o)Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1980, s 30(3)  -  Grape and Wine R&amp;D Corporation25,31525,31525,315(p)Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1980, s 30(3)  -  Rural Industries R&amp;D Corporation5,3125,3125,312(q)Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1980, s 30(3)  -  Sugar R&amp;D Corporation10,71210,71210,712(r)Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1980, s 30A(3)  -  Fisheries R&amp;D Corporation16,41516,52517,116(s)Wheat Marketing Act 1989, s 10A(2)3,7163,716- </DOC>

I have seen the programme in question and I reject the suggestion that this Government has anything to hide when it comes to the science of climate change. On the contrary, we have a record of keeping the Australian people well informed. The book Climate Change: an Australian Guide to the Science and Potential Impacts, edited by Dr Barrie Pittock is a prime example. This book explained the science clearly and factually. It is widely regarded as an excellent synthesis. More recently, I released Stronger Evidence but New Challenges: Climate Change Science 2001-2005 by Professor Will Steffen that explains important recent advances in climate change science.Yes.Yes.and (5) and (6) I have not spoken to managers at CSIRO about this matter and neither has anyone in my staff or my Department to the best of my knowledge.I am advised that it does.</DOC>

The legislative regulations relating to Australian Public Service employees are described within the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 that mandates employers are to provide a safe place of work.Defence policy on smoking within the workplace is outlined within the Defence Safety Manual. The policy prohibits smoking within all Defence workplaces.Smoking is permitted in outdoor environments only where the following criteria are met:The area must have a constant movement of substantially fresh air that immediately dissipates tobacco smoke.A smoker is not in the proximity of non-smokers. Smokers are not to congregate around entry and exit points of buildings or in close proximity to buildings where smoke might enter.There are no flammable or other hazardous substances present.To achieve the intention of the policy, an exclusion zone has been created around each of the Russell buildings by the use of 'No Smoking Beyond This Point' signs. This exclusion zone extends out approximately 20 metres from the entrance of buildings.(2)   Yes.(3)   (a)   Defence does not have an active monitoring program. Rather, Defence conducts an educational and awareness process for employees. Defence Smoke-Free Workplaces policy is promulgated, through a news article, to all Canberra based personnel on a quarterly basis through the Defence intranet.(b)   Defence relies on the reporting of any incidents to the Regional Safety Coordinator. Offenders, if identified, will be reacquainted with Defence policy and the requirements of the employee to abide with that policy.(c)   Consequences for ignoring Defence policy could include a breach of the Defence Code of Conduct and Australian Public Service Values and, in the worst case, a potential breach of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991.</DOC>

The Australian Government's budget for legal aid has increased over that period.The Australian Government makes payments for the provision of legal aid by State and Territory legal aid commissions in matters arising under Commonwealth law. These are made from two separate appropriations, because payments are made directly to legal aid commissions for some jurisdictions - Appropriation Act (No. 1) - and to States and Territories for other jurisdictions - Appropriation Act (No. 2).Since 2004 - 05, payments for the provision of legal aid in Commonwealth matters in New South Wales have been made directly to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission; before that, payments were made to the State of New South Wales. This change in arrangements required a transfer from an appropriation in Appropriation Act (No. 2) to one in Appropriation Act (No. 1). There was no reduction in the total amount appropriated in both Acts: in fact, between 2003 - 04 and 2005 - 06, the amount spent under these two appropriations increased by 16.01 per cent.The Australian Government also provides funds for other forms of legal assistance through:payments for the provision of legal aid to Indigenous Australianspayments to community legal servicespayments to Indigenous family violence prevention legal services, andpayments under various schemes of financial assistance.In 2003 - 04, these payments and the payments for the provision of legal aid in Commonwealth matters referred to above totalled $212.066m; in 2005 - 06, they totalled $236.082m - an increase of 11.33 per cent.</DOC>

Australia is working with other countries, particularly through the UN Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), to find ways that will be effective in reducing deforestation. Australia strongly supported the proposal from Papua New Guinea and other developing countries that the problem of deforestation be discussed in the UNFCCC, and Australia is participating in UNFCCC discussions on it. It would be premature for Australia to comment on the outcome of this process before all options have been considered. Australia remains committed to the success of the UNFCCC process, and will co-host with New Zealand the second UNFCCC workshop on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries in the first half of 2007. We have also committed to provide approximately $270,000 to support the participation of developing countries in this work.The objectives of the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate agreed to in Sydney in January 2006 remain unchanged. Papua New Guinea is not a member of AP6 and deforestation does not sit under any of the Partnership Task Forces.Consistent with our efforts to have the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, including agriculture, forestry and other land-uses, recognised under the UNFCCC, Australia strongly supports further consideration of this issue within this forum.Title: Advisory Support Facility-Advisory Support to the PNG Forest AuthorityCountry: Papua New Guinea (PNG)Description: Australia provides funding for four specialist advisers in the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA). The areas targeted are corporate governance, financial management, human resources, and information and communication systems.The advisers seek to improve corporate governance and financial accountability by transferring skills to key staff in the PNGFA. They provide advice, support, training and mentoring to strengthen management systems in the four target areas, strengthen the capabilities of staff to manage those systems, improve corporate planning processes and improve access to relevant, timely and accurate information. The advisers provide support to the Board and its sub-committees by strengthening their capabilities in their respective roles. Further support has been curtailed in recent years due to concerns about poor governance and the absence of a strong Government of PNG political commitment to reform in the sector.Amount of funding: $2.876 million (April 2003-June 2006); projected $1.166 million (July 2006-March 2008)Country: IndonesiaDescription: Australia is not currently providing support under the aid program to the forestry sector in Indonesia.Title: Solomon Islands Forestry Management ProjectCountry: Solomon IslandsDescription: Australia is currently supporting a four-year forestry project (due to be finalised in October 2008) supporting the Solomon Islands Government's reform agenda in the forestry sector. The project focuses on developing policies to improve the Ministry's operation and industry practices and support community reforestation.The Community Forestry component of the project aims to enhance rural livelihoods and income generating opportunities based on better management of forest resources. Its main focus has been on working with over 6,000 families to plant high value (predominantly teak) trees and support sustainable forestry practices. This aspect is underpinned by a comprehensive awareness raising campaign, which focuses on increasing community awareness of new market opportunities and improving the sustainability of logging practices.Amount of funding: $7.5 million</DOC>

Individuals will be required to present their access card when gaining access to government funded services and benefits at a pharmacy or doctor. Further to this, as identified in his speech to the National Press Club on 8 November 2006, opportunities will be further explored for the card whereby the individual can use their card to store voluntary personal information for use in non-government applications.Where the individual uses their access card to store voluntary non-government information for access to non-government benefits and services, this will be a matter for the individual.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 2 hours at an estimated cost of $126.</DOC>

I have established the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce, chaired by Professor Alan Fels AO, to report on consumer and privacy issues arising from the Australian Government's introduction of a new health and social services Access Card. The Taskforce has released Report Number 1 and the Government has released its Response to the Report.The Taskforce Report is informed by the views of 120 representative groups including the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police, and over 100 public submissions, most of which have been authorised for inclusion on the Taskforce website (www.humanservices.gov.au/access/consumer_privacy_taskforce.htm).The Consumer and Privacy Taskforce will continue to consult on the design and development of the Access Card. The Taskforce has also undertaken considerable research internationally to inform its advice to Government.The Office of Access Card has established a strong governance framework, including the Secretaries Group on the Access Card, the Deputy Secretaries Group on the Access Card, the Access Card Steering Committee and a range of specialist cross government working groups. The ATO and AFP actively participate in a number of these groups.To prepare this answer it has taken approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes at an estimated cost of $146.</DOC>

I have been informed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) that in October 2005 and July 2006, Castlemaine District Radio Inc made enquiries regarding licences for low power open narrowcasting services.In late January 2006, ACMA received complaints from Castlemaine District Radio Inc. (as opposed to Castlemaine Community Radio Inc.) alleging that three low power open narrowcasting (LPON) services in the Castlemaine and Maldon areas were not providing a service. Providing a service with reasonable regularity is a condition of a licence that authorises the operation of an LPON service.I am informed that ACMA undertook an investigation into these allegations.ACMA has advised that it cancelled one of the three licences in question August 2006. The former licensee has requested ACMA review its decision to cancel the licence and this internal review is expected to be completed by the end of November 2006. Depending upon the outcome of the review, the former licensee may choose to appeal ACMA's decision on reconsideration to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.Investigations have been completed into the other two licences and I understand that ACMA will shortly be considering the findings.</DOC>

Yes.The Minister will not comment on media speculation about policy matters.The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Act 2006 contains significant safeguards designed to protect diversity whilst encouraging greater competition and allowing media companies to achieve economies of scale and scope. In addition to the 5/4 diversity test, established under s61AB of the Act, transactions involving more than 2 out of the 3 regulated media platforms in a radio licence area are prohibited under s61AEA.The safeguards in the Act are based on the approach to media regulation as currently applied under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. All commercial television and radio licences and Associated Newspapers are subject to the same regulatory framework, regardless of content, ratings or other qualitative factors. Criticism of this approach should therefore also be directed at the outdated cross-media laws established by the previous government in 1987.Refer to the answer to part (3).</DOC>

to (3)The honourable member has repeatedly asked Questions on Notice regarding the impact on media diversity of the Government's media reform package. The Government has addressed this issue in detail in its media reform discussion paper of March 2006 Meeting the Digital Challenge, its announcement of the media reform package in July 2006 and then in Parliament as part of the process for the introduction and passage of the media reform bills, including an inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee.The Government has consistently explained in detail how its media reforms, as implemented by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Media Ownership) Act 2006, will reform Australia's outdated media ownership laws, while safeguarding media diversity. Further explanation is unnecessary, and accordingly the Minister will continue to refer the honourable member to previous answers.</DOC>

A person has an adverse criminal record if:he or she has been convicted of an aviation security relevant offence and sentenced to imprisonment; orin the case of a person who has been convicted twice or more of an aviation security relevant offence or offences, but no sentence of imprisonment was imposed  -  one of those convictions occurred within the previous 12 months.On 6 March 2006 the Australian Government introduced strengthened disqualifying criteria to assess the eligibility of all new ASIC applicants. Further regulation amendments were made on 8 May 2006 to allow for the reassessment of all existing ASIC holders who were issued an ASIC prior to 6 March 2006 against the strengthened criteria.In addition the new legislation allows for an individual to be deemed as having a qualified criminal record and thereby may qualify for an ASIC that is to be issued subject to a condition. In particular, a condition may be that background checking of the holder is carried out more frequently than required by the Regulations.If:</DOC>

Australia, as a member state of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has in place measures to ensure the security of air cargo which meet or exceed the requirements under Annex 17 of the International Convention on Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention).It is not a requirement of ICAO or the Australian Government to collect the data requested in this question. However, Government policy is to continue to strengthen Australia's air cargo security regime. To this end, in 2005-06 the Government funded the purchase of explosive trace detection equipment for use at all international cargo terminal operations and is extending this regime to domestic terminal operations in 2006-07. The use of this equipment is being supported by regulatory changes which will mandate its use.My Department is also currently evaluating the effectiveness of a variety of technologies in the examination of air cargo and working with international agencies and governments to assess the effectiveness and practicality of further security measures.Coupled with the use of technology in the examination of air cargo, there have been measures developed to ensure that security is effectively applied down the air cargo supply chain. The audit and compliance regime for the regulated air cargo agent scheme has been strengthened and regulated air cargo agents are now required to develop individual security risk assessments and have in place approved transport security programs relevant to their business.My Department is continuing to assess the air cargo environment for potential vulnerabilities and the practicality and effectiveness of measures to address those vulnerabilities.</DOC>

A member of an Aboriginal community who is a sea ranger, can also be a member of NORFORCE. However, not all sea rangers are members of NORFORCE. All NORFORCE recruits complete Common Induction Training or a Regional Force Surveillance Unit Induction Course. Members of Surveillance Squadrons then attend the NORFORCE Basic Patrol Course. NORFORCE personnel are paid the same rates as other Reserve personnel.The boarding and apprehension of vessels is a specialised law enforcement role that is conducted by trained Customs Officers and Defence personnel. The boarding of foreign fishing vessels (FFVs) is undertaken by officers who are equipped with personal defensive equipment and, in most instances, are supported by armed vessels. Officers are trained in the use of force and operate under strict rules. There is no current consideration of giving these powers to rangers.On 19 October 2006, a meeting of officials representing the Commonwealth, Western Australian, Northern Territory and Queensland governments endorsed a 12-month pilot program focused on use of indigenous rangers to locate FFVs close to or onshore.The concept for the trial was developed in April 2006, at the Commonwealth, State and Territory meeting on illegal fishing. At that time, the Australian Customs Service (Customs) and the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fishing were identified to assist with the development of the proposal.Funding was provided in the May 2006 Budget to establish pilot programs in three communities, each identified by one of the relevant state/territory governments.In addition to locating FFVs close to or onshore, rangers will monitor designated sites where previous foreign fishing activity has been noted and report to Customs on any indications of further activity. Customs and Fisheries officers may also seek assistance in accessing remote locations for other related tasks.The patrols will assist the rapid response helicopter program currently being established.In a separate but related initiative, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service received funding in the 2006-07 Budget to expand and continue its highly successful, longstanding program of engagement with indigenous communities to manage quarantine risks posed by FFVs.</DOC>

Mobility Allowance is available to assist people with disability receiving the Disability Support Pension (DSP), Youth Allowance (YA) and Newstart who are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. It is paid to a person regardless of whether public transport is actually available. This means a person living in an area with limited, or no, public transport services can access the payment. Mobility Allowance is not intended to reimburse all transport costs. The payment recognises that people with disability can incur higher transport costs and provides a financial incentive to assist them to participate in the workforce.There are now two levels of Mobility Allowance. The higher rate ($100 per fortnight), is paid to people on the DSP, Newstart or YA, who are working 15 hours or more a week for wages that are at or above the relevant minimum wage, or looking for such work under an agreement with an employment service provider.People working fewer hours and/or doing voluntary work or training for at least 32 hours over a four-week period are eligible for the standard rate of Mobility Allowance ($71.40 a fortnight), if they are unable to use public transport without assistance. Mobility Allowance is free of income and assets tests.The Pensioner Concession Card (PCC), issued to all DSP recipients, and also those Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients who can work part-time only, helps in meeting costs. State, territory and local governments offer reductions on public transport fares, rates, power bills and car registration to PCC holders.Each state and territory government also has initiatives designed to assist people with disability to access transport and, as a result, their community. Initiatives include parking concessions, vehicle registration/driver licensing concessions and taxi fare concessions. The level of assistance and eligibility criteria vary across jurisdictions.</DOC>

The Office of Small Business (OSB) within the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources (DITR) has responsibility for conducting an annual survey of the performance of Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 agencies' in relation to the Australian Government's 30 Day Payment Policy for small business procurement. In addition the OSB is responsible for seeking an explanation from any department or agency for underperformance in relation to the policy and their activities and plans to improve their payment performance.Previously from the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2005 the OSB conducted bi-annual surveys to monitor compliance with the 30 day payment policy. As a result of significant improvements in compliance and as part of the Government's Red Tape Reduction initiatives, reporting requirements have been reduced from bi-annually to annually.The OSB in DITR monitors Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 agencies. The OSB is currently in the process of moving compliance monitoring from bi-annual to annual.The OSB in DITR provides contacts in the relevant departments and agencies with survey instructions and the survey. The departments and agencies provide their response back to the OSB for data collection, collation and reporting.Table 1 overleaf shows the percentage of correctly rendered invoices (by number) paid within the 30 day payment period for each agency in scope for the last three survey periods.Explanatory notesThe survey reports on correctly rendered invoices for goods and services to specification received during the survey period for non-administered payments up to and including $5 million.Data for most agencies is for all payments  -  i.e. agency systems are not always able to identify Small to Medium Enterprises.Although payments to government agencies were excluded from the scope of the survey in 2003, some agencies are unable to separately identify these payments.In previous years, the role of the OSB has been confined to undertaking payment surveys of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 agencies in relation to the Australian Government's 30 day payment policy and reporting the results to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance and Administration.As part of the Government's Red Tape Reduction Initiatives, the role of OSB has been extended to provide OSB with the opportunity to take direct action towards improving government payment performance.After the conduct and analysis of the next survey to monitor compliance with the 30 day payment policy OSB will write to any under performing departments and agencies seeking an explanation from any department or agency for underperformance as well as their activities and plans to improve their payment performance.Table 1: Departments and agencies performance, July 04  -  Dec 04, Jan 05  -  June 05, July 05  -  Dec 05Agency (sorted alphabetically by portfolio)July-Dec 04Jan-June 05July-Dec 05Attorney General's Department1

1 Attorney General's DepartmentThe Attorney-General's Department has been actively pursuing a number of measures to improve the payment performance of the Department. These include improved internal reporting, increased use of credit cards, an internal audit of the accounts processing function including benchmarking against other Commonwealth agencies and ongoing internal assessments of business practices and processes to identify efficiencies and process improvements.2 Department of Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsDCITA has implemented a field in its financial management system to identify small and medium/large suppliers. Reporting from January 2005 is based only on payments to small business.3 Department of DefenceDefence recognises the need to ensure due date performance for payments to small business is at or above government benchmarks. To this end, the department has committed to a sustained focus on achieving and maintaining this position through a range of measures, namely:Improved staff training;Streamlined business processes;Supporting vendors to facilitate the payment process;Increasing the use of credit cards as a means of payment; andEnhanced monitoring of payment performance.4CentrelinkCentrelink considers its performance against this Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is understated for 2005 due to a system problem whereby the entry in the 'invoice due date' field was incorrectly calculated. For each of the reporting periods in 2005 the correct figure would have been higher than 90%. The system problem has now been addressed and as a result the reported KPI performance has improved for 2006.5Department of Immigration and Multicultural AffairsOver the past 18 months, across the 2004-05 and 2005-06 financial years, DIMA has undergone a significant reform programme to address issues identified in reviews of the department's operations undertaken by Mr Mick Palmer and Mr Neil Comrie. This reform has led to changes in structure, processes and procedures in a number of areas. Two of these  -  detention and IT - cover the major contracts managed by the department.The degree of change has led, to some extent, to delays in the administration of accounts payment. Given the structural reform process currently underway, it is expected that performance in this area will improve during the first half of 2006/07 as the new arrangements are fully implemented. Early indications are showing that, while there was some short term impact on the terms of trade, the trend is now correcting and the department will be back within tolerance by the end of the 2006 calendar year.In addition, DIMA has been required to work closely with suppliers to correct disputed invoices. The negotiation process around this has contributed to some delays as DIMA has sought to balance quality and timeliness, ensuring that all payments for services rendered are accurate.'6 Australian Bureau of StatisticsThe figures presented by the ABS understate actual performance as the determination of the payment timeframe is based upon the suppliers invoice date, not from agreement of a valid invoice, which in some cases is not the same thing (e.g. dispute over the goods and or services).</DOC>
