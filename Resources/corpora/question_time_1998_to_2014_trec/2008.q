     I refer the Prime Minister to page 56 of the Reserve Bank's recent statement on monetary policy which warns of 'the risk of generating an upward drift in inflation expectations which could feed into wage and price setting behaviour'.
     Given the Reserve Bank's view that expectations can in themselves drive inflation, why are he and his Treasurer going around and talking up inflation?

     -  - Is the Prime Minister aware that yesterday his Northern Territory representative Senator Trish Crossin sought to trivialise the child abuse and neglect in the Northern Territory when she said that 'only 50' children had been referred to Family and Community Services so far?
     She went on to say:So the dramas and the charades and the attention that was sought by the previous government in relation to child sexual abuse and child neglect, I believe, were severely overstated.
    Prime Minister, isn't the abuse of one child tragic enough - let alone 'only 50'?
     Will the Prime Minister require Senator Crossin to apologise for these dismissive and contemptuous remarks?

     I refer him to the forecast loss of more than 134,000 jobs within the next year due to Labor's high-taxing budget.
     On ABC this morning the Prime Minister referred to this as 'a modest increase in unemployment'.
     How can the Prime Minister boast that this is a budget for families when 134,000 families will move from work to welfare in the next year?
     These are people; they are not on a balance sheet.

     - My question is to the Prime Minister.
     I refer him to his new $3 billion alcopop tax.
     I note the two drinks here: a Yellowglen Pink, sold for $4.
    50, which not an alcopop; and a Bacardi Breezer, which is sold for also $4.
    50, which is an alcopop.
     I say to you, Prime Minister: isn't your alcopop tax just a tax grab?
     It does nothing about binge drinking, given that the major competitor to an alcopop is taxed at half the rate and has twice the amount of alcohol.
     It just shows this is a tax-grabbing con.

     2 shows that the new tax will raise $640 million in the first year - next year - and $892 million in 2011-12?

     The assumptions in the Treasury advice include a fifty-fifty chance of a redirection of alcohol consumption to other products as a result of the change in price of RTDs.

     Recently the Challenger Howard Mortgage Fund announced that, following the government's decision to implement the unlimited bank deposit guarantee, Challenger has capped redemptions from their fund.
     I draw the Treasurer's attention to similar redemption caps as well as the freezing of redemption requests, and in some cases disbursements, from other affected funds.
     Treasurer, with many partial pensioners and self-funded retirees no longer receiving income or access to their cash, why is the government compounding their hardship by refusing to help them with income support from Centrelink?

     Minister, earlier today in Senate estimates hearings on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, documents were tabled detailing your government's cuts in pays and allowances to ADF members engaged in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan.
     Because the government did not think these changes through properly and, instead, backdated them to August 2007, the documents tabled today revealed that a significant number of our SAS members have now incurred debts of up to $30,000 and, due to debt recovery, these elite men and women have been left with a take-home pay of only $250 per fortnight and interest on their debts at 7.
    2 per cent.
     Minister, will you immediately intervene to overturn this abhorrent cut to the pay and allowances of our fighting men and women and, importantly, step in without delay to protect the estates of the five brave men who made the supreme sacrifice in active service in Afghanistan - namely, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks and SAS Signaller Sean McCarthy?

    I also refer to the Prime Minister's subsequent observation in question time yesterday:I stand by everything the Treasurer has said.

     I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the letter I am holding from the Alexandrina Council, which covers the Lower Lakes that are in my electorate, delivered to the Prime Minister yesterday and calling for the government to deliver an extra 60 billion litres of water to save the Lower Lakes.
     -  - I also refer the Acting Prime Minister to the government's decision giving the green light to the Victorian government to take an additional 75 billion litres of water from the Murray-Darling Basin for the north-south pipeline.
     Will the Acting Prime Minister now take decisive action to stop the pipeline and keep the 75 billion litres within the Murray-Darling Basin to help save the Lower Lakes?

     I refer to the reported comments by the Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank that credit card interest rates are a sideshow to divert attention from what really matters.
     Does the Treasurer agree that credit card interest rates are a sideshow for consumers who owe money on their cards?

     Yes, I am standing.
     - My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing.
     Is the minister aware of the New South Wales government's proposal to impose an $8 million blood tax on private patients?
     Minister, given that the collection and supply of blood on a national basis is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states with taxpayers' money, will the minister condemn this unilateral action by her New South Wales counterparts to cover their own financial ineptitude by making private patients pay twice for blood?

     Is the minister aware of reports that 30 maternity units in local hospitals have now been closed throughout rural and regional New South Wales?
     Is the minister further aware that the next hospital targeted for closure is Pambula Hospital, and local community anger is such that, on 13 November, 800 people attended a public meeting to save Pambula Hospital?
     One of the people who should have been there and who did not attend of course was the member for Eden-Monaro.
     -  - Minister, as hospital funding has been finalised and the buck stops with the government on health, will you commit to keeping the maternity unit at Pambula Hospital open?

     Will the minister confirm that the latest cost estimate for the construction of the Dinmore to Goodna section of Ipswich Road is $2.
    7 billion, two and a half times last year's election promise of $1.
    1 billion?
     Minister, does this multibillion dollar blow-out in addition to computers in schools and broadband policy bungles not simply prove that the government is losing control of its budget?
